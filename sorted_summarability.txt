 Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms , including their structure, function, growth, evolution , distribution, and taxonomy . [ 1 ] Biology has many subdisciplines unified by five so-called axioms of modern biology: [ 2 ] 
 
 Cells are the basic unit of life 
 Genes are the basic unit of heredity 
 New species and inherited traits are the product of evolution 
 An organism regulates its internal environment to maintain a stable and constant condition 
 Living organisms consume and transform energy 
 
 Subdisciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which organisms are studied and the methods used to study them: biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules ; cellular biology examines the basic building block of all life, the cell ; physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues , organs , and organ systems of an organism; evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of life; and ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment .

 Ernst Haeckel 's Tree of Life (1879) 
 
 
 The term biology is derived from the Greek word βίος , bios , " life " and the suffix -λογία , -logia , "study of." [ 4 ] The Latin form of the term first appeared in 1736 when Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) used biologi in his Bibliotheca botanica . It was used again in 1766 in a work entitled Philosophiae naturalis sive physicae: tomus III, continens geologian, biologian, phytologian generalis , by Michael Christoph Hanov , a disciple of Christian Wolff . The first German use, Biologie , was used in a 1771 translation of Linnaeus' work. In 1797, Theodor Georg Roose used the term in a book, Grundzüge der Lehre van der Lebenskraft , in the preface. Karl Friedrich Burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological, physiological and psychological perspective ( Propädeutik zum Studien der gesammten Heilkunst ). The term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur (1802–22) by Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus , who announced: [ 5 ] 
 
 The objects of our research will be the different forms and manifestations of life, the conditions and laws under which these phenomena occur, and the causes through which they have been effected. The science that concerns itself with these objects we will indicate by the name biology [Biologie] or the doctrine of life [Lebenslehre]. (1:4) 
 
 Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia , Egypt , the Indian subcontinent , and China . However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece . [ 6 ] While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum , Theophrastus , wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even into the Middle Ages . 
 Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dinawari (828–896), who wrote on botany, [ 7 ] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology . Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life. 
 Biology began to quickly develop and grow with Antony van Leeuwenhoek 's improvement of the microscope . It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa , bacteria , infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and staining . [ 8 ] 
 Advances in microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell . Then, in 1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life , although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow , however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory . [ 9 ] 
 Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species. [ 10 ]  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon , treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent . Though he was opposed to evolution, Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought ; his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both Lamarck and Darwin . [ 11 ] 
 Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck , who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution. [ 12 ] He posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals, meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used, the more complex and efficient it would become, thus adapting the animal to its environment. Lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animal's offspring, who would further develop and perfect them. [ 13 ] However, it was the British naturalist Charles Darwin , combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection ; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions. [ 14 ] Although it was the subject of controversy (which continues to this day), Darwin's theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biology. 
 The discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics . In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes . A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria , along with the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics . From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana , Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons . Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome . This project was essentially completed in 2003, [ 15 ] with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms. 
 Foundations of modern biology 
 Much of modern biology can be encompassed within five unifying principles: cell theory, evolution, genetics, homeostasis, and energy. [ 2 ]

 Cell theory 
 Main article: Cell theory 
 Cell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life , and that all living things are composed of one or more cells or the secreted products of those cells (e.g. shells ). All cells arise from other cells through cell division . In multicellular organisms , every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg . The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. [ 16 ] Additionally, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism . Finally, cells contain hereditary information ( DNA ) which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. 
 Evolution

 Main article: Evolution 
 A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution , and that all life-forms known have a common origin . Introduced into the scientific lexicon by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck in 1809, [ 17 ] evolution was established by Charles Darwin fifty years later as a viable scientific model when he articulated its driving force: natural selection . [ 18 ]  [ 19 ] ( Alfred Russel Wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution.) [ 20 ] Evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on Earth. 
 Darwin theorized that species and breeds developed through the processes of natural selection and artificial selection or selective breeding . [ 21 ]  Genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theory. [ 22 ] 
 The evolutionary history of the species —which describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descended—together with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its phylogeny . Widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny. These include the comparisons of DNA sequences conducted within molecular biology or genomics , and comparisons of fossils or other records of ancient organisms in paleontology . [ 23 ] Biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods, including phylogenetics , phenetics , and cladistics . (For a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists, see evolutionary timeline .) 
 
 The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth , both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool . This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.5 billion years ago . [ 24 ] Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria , archaea , and eukaryotes (see: origin of life ). [ 25 ]

 Genetics 
 Main article: Genetics 
 Genes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms. A gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of DNA that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways. All organisms, from bacteria to animals, share the same basic machinery that copies and translates DNA into proteins . Cells transcribe a DNA gene into an RNA version of the gene, and a ribosome then translates the RNA into a protein, a sequence of amino acids . The translation code from RNA codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms, but slightly different for some. For example, a sequence of DNA that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms, such as plants. [ 26 ] 
 DNA usually occurs as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes , and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes . A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of DNA and histones . The set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria , chloroplasts , or other locations is collectively known as its genome . In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is located in the cell nucleus , along with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts . In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid . [ 27 ] The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype . [ 28 ] 
 Homeostasis 
 Main article: Homeostasis 
 
 
 
  
The hypothalamus secretes CRH , which directs the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH . In turn, ACTH directs the adrenal cortex to secrete glucocorticoids , such as cortisol . The GCs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of GCs has been released. [ 29 ] 
 
 
 Homeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms , whether unicellular or multicellular , exhibit homeostasis. [ 30 ] 
 To maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions, a system must detect and respond to perturbations. After the detection of a perturbation, a biological system normally responds through negative feedback . This means stabilizing conditions by either reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system. One example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too low. 
 
 
 
  
Basic overview of energy and human life . 
 
 
 Energy 
 The survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy . Chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed for biological chemical reactions ; second, they develop new molecular structures made up of biomolecules. 
 The organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs . Nearly all of these organisms originally draw energy from the sun. [ 31 ] Plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules, such as ATP , whose bonds can be broken to release energy. [ 32 ] A few ecosystems , however, depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane , sulfides , or other non- luminal energy sources. [ 33 ] 
 Some of the captured energy is used to produce biomass to sustain life and provide energy for growth and development. The majority of the rest of this energy is lost as heat and waste molecules. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism [ 34 ] and cellular respiration . [ 35 ] 
 Research 
 Structural

 Molecular biology is the study of biology at a molecular level. [ 36 ] This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly with genetics and biochemistry . Molecular biology chiefly concerns itself with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interrelationship of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and learning how these interactions are regulated. 
 Cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells , including their behaviors , interactions, and environment . This is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels, for single-celled organisms such as bacteria as well as the specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans . Understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences. The similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biology. 
 Anatomy considers the forms of macroscopic structures such as organs and organ systems. [ 37 ] 
 Genetics is the science of genes , heredity , and the variation of organisms . [ 38 ]  [ 39 ] Genes encode the information necessary for synthesizing proteins, which in turn play a large role in influencing (though, in many instances, not completely determining) the final phenotype of the organism. In modern research, genetics provides important tools in the investigation of the function of a particular gene, or the analysis of genetic interactions . Within organisms, genetic information generally is carried in chromosomes , where it is represented in the chemical structure of particular DNA molecules . 
 Developmental biology studies the process by which organisms grow and develop. Originating in embryology , modern developmental biology studies the genetic control of cell growth , differentiation , and " morphogenesis ," which is the process that progressively gives rise to tissues , organs , and anatomy . Model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans , [ 40 ] the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , [ 41 ] the zebrafish Danio rerio , [ 42 ] the mouse Mus musculus , , [ 43 ] and the weed Arabidopsis thaliana . [ 44 ]  [ 45 ] (A model organism is a species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena , with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organisms.) [ 46 ] 
 Physiological 
 Main article: Physiology 
 Physiology studies the mechanical, physical, and biochemical processes of living organisms by attempting to understand how all of the structures function as a whole. The theme of "structure to function" is central to biology. Physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology , but some principles of physiology are universal, no matter what particular organism is being studied. For example, what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells. The field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species. Plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fields. 
 Physiology studies how for example nervous , immune , endocrine , respiratory , and circulatory systems, function and interact. The study of these systems is shared with medically oriented disciplines such as neurology and immunology . 
 Evolutionary 
 Evolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species , as well as their change over time, and includes scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines. For example, it generally involves scientists who have special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy , ornithology , botany , or herpetology , but use those organisms as systems to answer general questions about evolution. 
 Evolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology , which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution, [ 47 ] and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics [ 48 ] and evolutionary theory. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology from its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology . [ 49 ] Related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology are phylogenetics , systematics , and taxonomy .

Trees constructed with other genes are generally similar, although they may place some early-branching groups very differently, presumably owing to rapid rRNA evolution. The exact relationships of the three domains are still being debated.

 Main article: Systematics 
 Multiple speciation events create a tree structured system of relationships between species. The role of systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species. [ 50 ] However, systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was common. [ 51 ] The classification, taxonomy , and nomenclature of biological organisms is administered by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , International Code of Botanical Nomenclature , and International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria for animals, plants, and bacteria, respectively. The classification of viruses , viroids , prions , and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the International Code of Virus classification and nomenclature . [ 52 ]  [ 53 ]  [ 54 ]  [ 55 ] However, several other viral classification systems do exist. 
 Traditionally, living things have been divided into five kingdoms: Monera ; Protista ; Fungi ; Plantae ; Animalia . [ 56 ] 
 However, many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system : Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria); Eukaryota (including protists , fungi , plants , and animals ) [ 57 ] These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the cell exteriors. [ 57 ] 
 Further, each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified. The order is: Domain ; Kingdom ; Phylum ; Class ; Order ; Family ; Genus ; Species . 
 There is also a series of intracellular parasites that are "on the edge of life" [ 58 ] in terms of metabolic activity, meaning that many scientists do not actually classify these structures as alive, due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions that define life. They are classified as viruses , viroids , prions , or satellites . 
 The scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species. For example, humans are listed as Homo sapiens . Homo is the genus, and sapiens the species. When writing the scientific name of an organism, it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase. Additionally, the entire term may be italicized or underlined. [ 59 ]  [ 60 ] 
 The dominant classification system is called the Linnaean taxonomy . It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature . How organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN), the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (ICNB). 
 A merging draft, BioCode , was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted. [ 61 ] The BioCode draft has received little attention since 1997; its originally planned implementation date of January 1, 2000, has passed unnoticed. A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. [ 62 ]  [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN) remains outside the BioCode.

 Main articles: Ecology , Ethology , Behavior , and Biogeography 
 Ecology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms , and the interactions between organisms and their environment . [ 65 ] The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology , in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment. [ 66 ] One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium in a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna . For any species, behaviors can be co-operative , aggressive , parasitic , or symbiotic . Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem . 
 Ecological systems are studied at several different levels, from individuals and populations to ecosystems and the biosphere . The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology , although population biology is more frequently used when studying diseases , viruses , and microbes , while population ecology is more commonly used when studying plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines. 
 Ethology studies animal behavior (particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids ), and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology. Ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection . In one sense, the first modern ethologist was Charles Darwin , whose book, The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , influenced many ethologists to come. [ 67 ] 
 Biogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the Earth , [ 68 ] focusing on topics like plate tectonics , climate change , dispersal and migration , and cladistics .

 ^  As Darwinian scholar Joseph Carroll of the University of Missouri–St. Louis puts it in his introduction to a modern reprint of Darwin's work: " The Origin of Species has special claims on our attention. It is one of the two or three most significant works of all time—one of those works that fundamentally and permanently alter our vision of the world&#160;... It is argued with a singularly rigorous consistency but it is also eloquent, imaginatively evocative, and rhetorically compelling." Carroll, Joseph, ed. (2003).

 Cell biology (formerly cytology , from the Greek kytos , "contain") is a scientific discipline that studies cells – their physiological properties, their structure, the organelles they contain, interactions with their environment, their life cycle , division and death . This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level. Cell biology research encompasses both the great diversity of single-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa , as well as the many specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans , plants , and sponges . 
 Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences . Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as to biomedical fields such as cancer research and developmental biology . These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, sometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Therefore, research in cell biology is closely related to genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , immunology , and developmental biology .

Endothelial cells under the microscope. Nuclei are stained blue with DAPI, microtubles are marked green by an antibody and actin filaments are labelled red with phalloidin. 
 
 
 Each type of protein is usually sent to a particular part of the cell. An important part of cell biology is the investigation of molecular mechanisms by which proteins are moved to different places inside cells or secreted from cells. 
 Most proteins are synthesized by ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). Ribosomes contain the nucleic acid RNA, which assembles and joins amino acids to make proteins. They can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm as well as on the rER. This process is known as protein biosynthesis . Biosynthesis (also called biogenesis) is an enzyme-catalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products (also simply known as protein translation ). Some proteins, such as those to be incorporated in membranes (known as membrane proteins ), are transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during synthesis. This process can be followed by transportation and processing in the Golgi apparatus . The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that processes proteins and prepares them for use both inside and outside the cell. The Golgi apparatus is somewhat like a post office. It receives items (proteins from the ER), packages and labels them, and then sends them on to their destinations (to different parts of the cell or to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell). [ 1 ] From the Golgi, membrane proteins can move to the plasma membrane , to other sub-cellular compartments, or they can be secreted from the cell. The ER and Golgi can be thought of as the "membrane protein synthesis compartment" and the "membrane protein processing compartment", respectively. There is a semi-constant flux of proteins through these compartments. ER and Golgi-resident proteins associate with other proteins but remain in their respective compartments. Other proteins "flow" through the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. Motor proteins transport membrane protein-containing vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks to distant parts of cells such as axon terminals. 
 Some proteins that are made in the cytoplasm contain structural features that target them for transport into mitochondria or the nucleus . Some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for by mitochondrial DNA. In plants, chloroplasts also make some cell proteins. 
 Extracellular and cell surface proteins destined to be degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into endocytosed vesicles some of which fuse with lysosomes where the proteins are broken down to their individual amino acids . The degradation of some membrane proteins begins while still at the cell surface when they are separated by secretases . Proteins that function in the cytoplasm are often degraded by proteasomes . 
 [ edit ] Other cellular processes 
 
 Active transport and Passive transport - Movement of molecules into and out of cells. 
 Autophagy - The process whereby cells "eat" their own internal components or microbial invaders. 
 Adhesion - Holding together cells and tissues. 
 Reproduction - Made possible by the combination of sperm made in the testiculi (contained in some male cells' nuclei) and the egg made in the ovary (contained in the nucleus of a female cell). When the sperm breaks through the hard outer shell of the egg a new cell embryo is formed, which, in humans, grows to full size in 9 months. 
 Cell movement: Chemotaxis , Contraction , cilia and flagella . 
 Cell signaling - Regulation of cell behavior by signals from outside. 
 DNA repair and Cell death 
 Metabolism : Glycolysis , respiration , Photosynthesis 
 Tration and mRNA splicing - gene expression. 
 
 [ edit ] Internal cellular structures 
 
 
 
  
Electron micrograph. 
 
 
 
 Chloroplast - key organelle for photosynthesis (only found in plant cells) 
 Cell wall - extra layer of protection (only found in plant cells) 
 Cell membrane - the part of the cell which separates the cells from the outside environment and protects the cell 
 Cilium - motile microtubule -containing structure of eukaryotes 
 Cytoplasm - contents of the main fluid-filled space inside cells 
 Cytoskeleton - protein filaments inside cells 
 Endoplasmic reticulum - major site of membrane protein synthesis 
 Flagellum - motile structure of bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes 
 Golgi apparatus - site of protein glycosylation in the endomembrane system 
 Lipid bilayer - fundamental organizational structure of cell membranes 
 Lysosome - break down cellular waste products and debris into simple compounds (only found in animal cells) 
 Membrane lipid and protein barrier 
 Mitochondrion - major energy-producing organelle by releasing it in the form of ATP 
 Nucleus - holds most of the DNA of eukaryotic cells and controls all cellular activities 
 Organelle - term used for major subcellular structures 
 Ribosome - RNA and protein complex required for protein synthesis in cells 
 Vesicle - small membrane-bounded spheres inside cells 
 
 [ edit ] Techniques used to study cells 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Cells may be observed under the microscope . This includes the Optical Microscope , Transmission Electron Microscope , Scanning Electron Microscope , Fluorescence Microscope , and by Confocal Microscopy . 
 Several different techniques exist to study cells are 
 
 Cell culture is the basic technique of growing cells in a laboratory independent of an organism. 
 Immunostaining , also known as immunohistochemistry , is a specialized histological method used to localize proteins in cells or tissue slices. Unlike regular histology, which uses stains to identify cells, cellular components or protein classes, immunostaining requires the reaction of an antibody directed against the protein of interest within the tissue or cell. Through the use of proper controls and published protocols (need to add reference links here), specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction can be achieved. Once this complex is formed, it is identified via either a "tag" attached directly to the antibody, or added in an additional technical step. Commonly used "tags" include fluorophores or enzymes. In the case of the former, detection of the location of the "immuno-stained" protein occurs via fluorescence microscopy . With an enzymatic tag, such as horse radish peroxidase, a chemical reaction is carried out that results in a dark color in the location of the protein of interest. This darkened pattern is then detected using light microscopy . 
 Computational genomics is used to find patterns in genomic information [ 2 ] 
 DNA microarrays identify changes in transcript levels between different experimental conditions. 
 Gene knockdown mutates a selected gene. 
 In situ hybridization shows which cells are expressing a particular RNA transcript. 
 PCR can be used to determine how many copies of a gene are present in a cell. 
 Transfection introduces a new gene into a cell, usually an expression construct 
 
 Purification of cells and their parts Purification may be performed using the following methods: 
 
 Cell fractionation 
 
 Release of cellular organelles by disruption of cells. 
 Separation of different organelles by centrifugation . 
 
 
 Flow cytometry 
 Immunoprecipitation 
 Proteins extracted from cell membranes by detergents and salts or other kinds of chemicals.

 Cell biology (formerly cytology , from the Greek kytos , "contain") is a scientific discipline that studies cells – their physiological properties, their structure, the organelles they contain, interactions with their environment, their life cycle , division and death . This is done both on a microscopic and molecular level. Cell biology research encompasses both the great diversity of single-celled organisms like bacteria and protozoa , as well as the many specialized cells in multicellular organisms such as humans , plants , and sponges . 
 Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences . Appreciating the similarities and differences between cell types is particularly important to the fields of cell and molecular biology as well as to biomedical fields such as cancer research and developmental biology . These fundamental similarities and differences provide a unifying theme, sometimes allowing the principles learned from studying one cell type to be extrapolated and generalized to other cell types. Therefore, research in cell biology is closely related to genetics , biochemistry , molecular biology , immunology , and developmental biology .

 Each type of protein is usually sent to a particular part of the cell. An important part of cell biology is the investigation of molecular mechanisms by which proteins are moved to different places inside cells or secreted from cells. 
 Most proteins are synthesized by ribosomes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER). Ribosomes contain the nucleic acid RNA, which assembles and joins amino acids to make proteins. They can be found alone or in groups within the cytoplasm as well as on the rER. This process is known as protein biosynthesis . Biosynthesis (also called biogenesis) is an enzyme-catalyzed process in cells of living organisms by which substrates are converted to more complex products (also simply known as protein translation ). Some proteins, such as those to be incorporated in membranes (known as membrane proteins ), are transported into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during synthesis. This process can be followed by transportation and processing in the Golgi apparatus . The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that processes proteins and prepares them for use both inside and outside the cell. The Golgi apparatus is somewhat like a post office. It receives items (proteins from the ER), packages and labels them, and then sends them on to their destinations (to different parts of the cell or to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell). [ 1 ] From the Golgi, membrane proteins can move to the plasma membrane , to other sub-cellular compartments, or they can be secreted from the cell. The ER and Golgi can be thought of as the "membrane protein synthesis compartment" and the "membrane protein processing compartment", respectively. There is a semi-constant flux of proteins through these compartments. ER and Golgi-resident proteins associate with other proteins but remain in their respective compartments. Other proteins "flow" through the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. Motor proteins transport membrane protein-containing vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks to distant parts of cells such as axon terminals. 
 Some proteins that are made in the cytoplasm contain structural features that target them for transport into mitochondria or the nucleus . Some mitochondrial proteins are made inside mitochondria and are coded for by mitochondrial DNA. In plants, chloroplasts also make some cell proteins. 
 Extracellular and cell surface proteins destined to be degraded can move back into intracellular compartments upon being incorporated into endocytosed vesicles some of which fuse with lysosomes where the proteins are broken down to their individual amino acids . The degradation of some membrane proteins begins while still at the cell surface when they are separated by secretases . Proteins that function in the cytoplasm are often degraded by proteasomes . 
 [ edit ] Other cellular processes 
 
 Active transport and Passive transport - Movement of molecules into and out of cells. 
 Autophagy - The process whereby cells "eat" their own internal components or microbial invaders. 
 Adhesion - Holding together cells and tissues. 
 Reproduction - Made possible by the combination of sperm made in the testiculi (contained in some male cells' nuclei) and the egg made in the ovary (contained in the nucleus of a female cell). When the sperm breaks through the hard outer shell of the egg a new cell embryo is formed, which, in humans, grows to full size in 9 months.

 [ edit ] Techniques used to study cells 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Cells may be observed under the microscope . This includes the Optical Microscope , Transmission Electron Microscope , Scanning Electron Microscope , Fluorescence Microscope , and by Confocal Microscopy . 
 Several different techniques exist to study cells are 
 
 Cell culture is the basic technique of growing cells in a laboratory independent of an organism. 
 Immunostaining , also known as immunohistochemistry , is a specialized histological method used to localize proteins in cells or tissue slices. Unlike regular histology, which uses stains to identify cells, cellular components or protein classes, immunostaining requires the reaction of an antibody directed against the protein of interest within the tissue or cell. Through the use of proper controls and published protocols (need to add reference links here), specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction can be achieved. Once this complex is formed, it is identified via either a "tag" attached directly to the antibody, or added in an additional technical step. Commonly used "tags" include fluorophores or enzymes. In the case of the former, detection of the location of the "immuno-stained" protein occurs via fluorescence microscopy . With an enzymatic tag, such as horse radish peroxidase, a chemical reaction is carried out that results in a dark color in the location of the protein of interest. This darkened pattern is then detected using light microscopy . 
 Computational genomics is used to find patterns in genomic information [ 2 ] 
 DNA microarrays identify changes in transcript levels between different experimental conditions. 
 Gene knockdown mutates a selected gene. 
 In situ hybridization shows which cells are expressing a particular RNA transcript. 
 PCR can be used to determine how many copies of a gene are present in a cell. 
 Transfection introduces a new gene into a cell, usually an expression construct 
 
 Purification of cells and their parts Purification may be performed using the following methods: 
 
 Cell fractionation 
 
 Release of cellular organelles by disruption of cells. 
 Separation of different organelles by centrifugation . 
 
 
 Flow cytometry 
 Immunoprecipitation 
 Proteins extracted from cell membranes by detergents and salts or other kinds of chemicals.

 [ edit ] Techniques used to study cells 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 Cells may be observed under the microscope . This includes the Optical Microscope , Transmission Electron Microscope , Scanning Electron Microscope , Fluorescence Microscope , and by Confocal Microscopy . 
 Several different techniques exist to study cells are 
 
 Cell culture is the basic technique of growing cells in a laboratory independent of an organism. 
 Immunostaining , also known as immunohistochemistry , is a specialized histological method used to localize proteins in cells or tissue slices. Unlike regular histology, which uses stains to identify cells, cellular components or protein classes, immunostaining requires the reaction of an antibody directed against the protein of interest within the tissue or cell. Through the use of proper controls and published protocols (need to add reference links here), specificity of the antibody-antigen reaction can be achieved. Once this complex is formed, it is identified via either a "tag" attached directly to the antibody, or added in an additional technical step. Commonly used "tags" include fluorophores or enzymes. In the case of the former, detection of the location of the "immuno-stained" protein occurs via fluorescence microscopy . With an enzymatic tag, such as horse radish peroxidase, a chemical reaction is carried out that results in a dark color in the location of the protein of interest. This darkened pattern is then detected using light microscopy . 
 Computational genomics is used to find patterns in genomic information [ 2 ] 
 DNA microarrays identify changes in transcript levels between different experimental conditions. 
 Gene knockdown mutates a selected gene. 
 In situ hybridization shows which cells are expressing a particular RNA transcript. 
 PCR can be used to determine how many copies of a gene are present in a cell. 
 Transfection introduces a new gene into a cell, usually an expression construct 
 
 Purification of cells and their parts Purification may be performed using the following methods: 
 
 Cell fractionation 
 
 Release of cellular organelles by disruption of cells. 
 Separation of different organelles by centrifugation . 
 
 
 Flow cytometry 
 Immunoprecipitation 
 Proteins extracted from cell membranes by detergents and salts or other kinds of chemicals.

 A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms. [ 1 ] Model organisms are in vivo models and are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical . [ 2 ] This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution . [ 3 ] Studying model organisms can be informative, but care must be taken when extrapolating from one organism to another.

 [ edit ] Selecting a model organism 
 Models are those organisms with a wealth of biological data that make them attractive to study as examples for other species and/or natural phenomena that are more difficult to study directly. Continual research on these organisms focus on a wide variety of experimental techniques and goals from many different levels of biology—from ecology , behavior , and biomechanics , down to the tiny functional scale of individual tissues , organelles , and proteins . Inquiries about the DNA of organisms are classed as genetic models (with short generation times, such as the fruitfly and nematode worm), experimental models, and genomic parsimony models, investigating pivotal position in the evolutionary tree. [ 4 ] Historically, model organisms include a handful of species with extensive genomic research data, such as the NIH model organisms. [ 5 ] 
 Often, model organisms are chosen on the basis that they are amenable to experimental manipulation. This usually will include characteristics such as short life-cycle , techniques for genetic manipulation ( inbred strains, stem cell lines, and methods of transformation ) and non-specialist living requirements. Sometimes, the genome arrangement facilitates the sequencing of the model organism's genome, for example, by being very compact or having a low proportion of junk DNA (e.g. yeast , arabidopsis , or pufferfish ). 
 When researchers look for an organism to use in their studies, they look for several traits. Among these are size, generation time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation of mechanisms, and potential economic benefit. As comparative molecular biology has become more common, some researchers have sought model organisms from a wider assortment of lineages on the tree of life . 
 [ edit ] Use of model organisms 
 There are many model organisms. One of the first model systems for molecular biology was the bacterium Escherichia coli , a common constituent of the human digestive system. Several of the bacterial viruses ( bacteriophage ) that infect E. coli also have been very useful for the study of gene structure and gene regulation (e.g. phages Lambda and T4 ). However, bacteriophages are not organisms because they lack metabolism and depend on functions of the host cells for propagation. 
 In eukaryotes , several yeasts, particularly Saccharomyces cerevisiae ("baker's" or "budding" yeast), have been widely used in genetics and cell biology , largely because they are quick and easy to grow. The cell cycle in a simple yeast is very similar to the cell cycle in humans and is regulated by homologous proteins. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is studied, again, because it is easy to grow for an animal, has various visible congenital traits and has a polytene (giant) chromosome in its salivary glands that can be examined under a light microscope. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans is studied because it has very defined development patterns involving fixed numbers of cells, and it can be rapidly assayed for abnormalities.

 Evolutionary biology is a sub-field of biology concerned with the study of the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the diversity of life on Earth. Someone who studies evolutionary biology is known as an evolutionary biologist ; evolutionary biologists study the descent of species and the origin of new species .

 [ edit ] Subfields 
 The study of evolution is the unifying concept in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is a conceptual subfield of biology that intersects with other subfields that are delimited by organizational level (e.g. cell biology , population biology ), taxonomic level (e.g. zoology , ornithology , herpetology ) or angle of approach (e.g. field biology , theoretical biology , experimental evolution , paleontology ). Usually, these intersections are combined into specific fields such as evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology . 
 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of evolutionary thought 
 Evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged as a result of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. [ 1 ] It was not until the 1970s and 1980s, however, that a significant number of universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology in their titles. In the United States , as a result of the rapid growth of molecular and cell biology , many universities have split (or aggregated) their biology departments into molecular and cell biology -style departments and ecology and evolutionary biology -style departments (which often have subsumed older departments in botany , zoology and the like). The subdiscipline of paleontology is often found in earth science /geology/geoscience departments. 
 Microbiology has recently developed into an evolutionary discipline. It was originally ignored due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of our extensive understanding of microbial physiology, the ease of microbial genomics , and the quick generation time of some microbes to answer evolutionary questions. Similar features have led to progress in viral evolution, particularly for bacteriophages . 
 [ edit ] Important evolutionary biologists 
 Main category: Evolutionary biologists 
 Many biologists have contributed to our current understanding of evolution. The establishment of evolutionary biology as a professional scientific discipline only started with the development of population genetics and the formulation of the modern evolutionary synthesis . Theodosius Dobzhansky and E. B. Ford were particularly important in the establishment of an empirical research programme for evolutionary biology. [ 2 ]  Ernst Mayr , George Gaylord Simpson and G. Ledyard Stebbins were also important discipline-builders during the modern synthesis, in the fields of systematics , paleontology and botany , respectively. [ 2 ] Through training many future evolutionary biologists, James Crow , [ 3 ]  Richard Lewontin , [ 4 ]  Dan Hartl , [ 5 ]  Marcus Feldman [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] and Brian Charlesworth [ 8 ] have also made large contributions to building the discipline of evolutionary biology. 
 [ edit ] Journals 
 Some scientific journals specialize exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals Evolution , Journal of Evolutionary Biology and BMC Evolutionary Biology . Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals Systematic Biology , Molecular Biology and Evolution and its sister journal Genome Biology and Evolution, and Cladistics . 
 Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, Molecular Ecology , Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B , The American Naturalist and Theoretical Population Biology have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics . The journals Genetics and PLoS Genetics overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature. 
 [ edit ] Current research topics 
 Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics, as should be expected given the centrality of evolution to understanding biology. Modern evolutionary biology incorporates ideas from diverse areas of science, such as molecular genetics and even computer science . 
 First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for by the work of the modern evolutionary synthesis . These phenomena include speciation , [ 9 ] the evolution of sexual reproduction , [ 10 ] the evolution of cooperation , the evolution of ageing , and evolvability . [ 11 ] 
 Second, biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as paleobiology , as well as systematics and phylogenetics . 
 Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation . They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, to what extent are the effects of different genes interdependent, what sort of function do the genes involved tend to have, and what sort of changes tend to happen to them (e.g. point mutations vs. gene duplication or even genome duplication ). Evolutionary biologists try to reconcile the high heritability seen in twin studies with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome-wide association studies . [ 12 ] 
 One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical population genetics that catalyzed the modern evolutionary synthesis needs to be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development, in order to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of molecular evolution . For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting selective sweeps . [ 13 ] 
 Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance. [ 14 ] Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include natural selection , sexual selection , genetic drift , genetic draft , developmental constraints, mutation bias and biogeography . 
 An evolutionary approach is also key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and ecology . For example, evolutionary thinking is key to life history theory . Annotation of genes and their function relies heavily on comparative, i.e. evolutionary, approaches. The field of evo-devo investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

 Evolutionary biology is a sub-field of biology concerned with the study of the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the diversity of life on Earth. Someone who studies evolutionary biology is known as an evolutionary biologist ; evolutionary biologists study the descent of species and the origin of new species .

 [ edit ] Subfields 
 The study of evolution is the unifying concept in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is a conceptual subfield of biology that intersects with other subfields that are delimited by organizational level (e.g. cell biology , population biology ), taxonomic level (e.g. zoology , ornithology , herpetology ) or angle of approach (e.g. field biology , theoretical biology , experimental evolution , paleontology ). Usually, these intersections are combined into specific fields such as evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology . 
 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of evolutionary thought 
 Evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged as a result of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. [ 1 ] It was not until the 1970s and 1980s, however, that a significant number of universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology in their titles. In the United States , as a result of the rapid growth of molecular and cell biology , many universities have split (or aggregated) their biology departments into molecular and cell biology -style departments and ecology and evolutionary biology -style departments (which often have subsumed older departments in botany , zoology and the like). The subdiscipline of paleontology is often found in earth science /geology/geoscience departments. 
 Microbiology has recently developed into an evolutionary discipline. It was originally ignored due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of our extensive understanding of microbial physiology, the ease of microbial genomics , and the quick generation time of some microbes to answer evolutionary questions. Similar features have led to progress in viral evolution, particularly for bacteriophages . 
 [ edit ] Important evolutionary biologists 
 Main category: Evolutionary biologists 
 Many biologists have contributed to our current understanding of evolution. The establishment of evolutionary biology as a professional scientific discipline only started with the development of population genetics and the formulation of the modern evolutionary synthesis . Theodosius Dobzhansky and E. B. Ford were particularly important in the establishment of an empirical research programme for evolutionary biology. [ 2 ]  Ernst Mayr , George Gaylord Simpson and G. Ledyard Stebbins were also important discipline-builders during the modern synthesis, in the fields of systematics , paleontology and botany , respectively. [ 2 ] Through training many future evolutionary biologists, James Crow , [ 3 ]  Richard Lewontin , [ 4 ]  Dan Hartl , [ 5 ]  Marcus Feldman [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] and Brian Charlesworth [ 8 ] have also made large contributions to building the discipline of evolutionary biology. 
 [ edit ] Journals 
 Some scientific journals specialize exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals Evolution , Journal of Evolutionary Biology and BMC Evolutionary Biology . Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals Systematic Biology , Molecular Biology and Evolution and its sister journal Genome Biology and Evolution, and Cladistics . 
 Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, Molecular Ecology , Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B , The American Naturalist and Theoretical Population Biology have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics . The journals Genetics and PLoS Genetics overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature. 
 [ edit ] Current research topics 
 Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics, as should be expected given the centrality of evolution to understanding biology. Modern evolutionary biology incorporates ideas from diverse areas of science, such as molecular genetics and even computer science . 
 First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for by the work of the modern evolutionary synthesis . These phenomena include speciation , [ 9 ] the evolution of sexual reproduction , [ 10 ] the evolution of cooperation , the evolution of ageing , and evolvability . [ 11 ] 
 Second, biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as paleobiology , as well as systematics and phylogenetics . 
 Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation . They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, to what extent are the effects of different genes interdependent, what sort of function do the genes involved tend to have, and what sort of changes tend to happen to them (e.g. point mutations vs. gene duplication or even genome duplication ). Evolutionary biologists try to reconcile the high heritability seen in twin studies with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome-wide association studies . [ 12 ] 
 One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical population genetics that catalyzed the modern evolutionary synthesis needs to be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development, in order to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of molecular evolution . For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting selective sweeps . [ 13 ] 
 Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance. [ 14 ] Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include natural selection , sexual selection , genetic drift , genetic draft , developmental constraints, mutation bias and biogeography . 
 An evolutionary approach is also key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and ecology . For example, evolutionary thinking is key to life history theory . Annotation of genes and their function relies heavily on comparative, i.e. evolutionary, approaches. The field of evo-devo investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

 Evolutionary biology is a sub-field of biology concerned with the study of the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the diversity of life on Earth. Someone who studies evolutionary biology is known as an evolutionary biologist ; evolutionary biologists study the descent of species and the origin of new species .

 [ edit ] Subfields 
 The study of evolution is the unifying concept in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology is a conceptual subfield of biology that intersects with other subfields that are delimited by organizational level (e.g. cell biology , population biology ), taxonomic level (e.g. zoology , ornithology , herpetology ) or angle of approach (e.g. field biology , theoretical biology , experimental evolution , paleontology ). Usually, these intersections are combined into specific fields such as evolutionary ecology and evolutionary developmental biology . 
 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of evolutionary thought 
 Evolutionary biology, as an academic discipline in its own right, emerged as a result of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s. [ 1 ] It was not until the 1970s and 1980s, however, that a significant number of universities had departments that specifically included the term evolutionary biology in their titles. In the United States , as a result of the rapid growth of molecular and cell biology , many universities have split (or aggregated) their biology departments into molecular and cell biology -style departments and ecology and evolutionary biology -style departments (which often have subsumed older departments in botany , zoology and the like). The subdiscipline of paleontology is often found in earth science /geology/geoscience departments. 
 Microbiology has recently developed into an evolutionary discipline. It was originally ignored due to the paucity of morphological traits and the lack of a species concept in microbiology. Now, evolutionary researchers are taking advantage of our extensive understanding of microbial physiology, the ease of microbial genomics , and the quick generation time of some microbes to answer evolutionary questions. Similar features have led to progress in viral evolution, particularly for bacteriophages . 
 [ edit ] Important evolutionary biologists 
 Main category: Evolutionary biologists 
 Many biologists have contributed to our current understanding of evolution. The establishment of evolutionary biology as a professional scientific discipline only started with the development of population genetics and the formulation of the modern evolutionary synthesis . Theodosius Dobzhansky and E. B. Ford were particularly important in the establishment of an empirical research programme for evolutionary biology. [ 2 ]  Ernst Mayr , George Gaylord Simpson and G. Ledyard Stebbins were also important discipline-builders during the modern synthesis, in the fields of systematics , paleontology and botany , respectively. [ 2 ] Through training many future evolutionary biologists, James Crow , [ 3 ]  Richard Lewontin , [ 4 ]  Dan Hartl , [ 5 ]  Marcus Feldman [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] and Brian Charlesworth [ 8 ] have also made large contributions to building the discipline of evolutionary biology. 
 [ edit ] Journals 
 Some scientific journals specialize exclusively in evolutionary biology as a whole, including the journals Evolution , Journal of Evolutionary Biology and BMC Evolutionary Biology . Some journals cover sub-specialties within evolutionary biology, such as the journals Systematic Biology , Molecular Biology and Evolution and its sister journal Genome Biology and Evolution, and Cladistics . 
 Other journals combine aspects of evolutionary biology with other related fields. For example, Molecular Ecology , Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B , The American Naturalist and Theoretical Population Biology have overlap with ecology and other aspects of organismal biology. Overlap with ecology is also prominent in the review journals Trends in Ecology and Evolution and Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics . The journals Genetics and PLoS Genetics overlap with molecular genetics questions that are not obviously evolutionary in nature. 
 [ edit ] Current research topics 
 Current research in evolutionary biology covers diverse topics, as should be expected given the centrality of evolution to understanding biology. Modern evolutionary biology incorporates ideas from diverse areas of science, such as molecular genetics and even computer science . 
 First, some fields of evolutionary research try to explain phenomena that were poorly accounted for by the work of the modern evolutionary synthesis . These phenomena include speciation , [ 9 ] the evolution of sexual reproduction , [ 10 ] the evolution of cooperation , the evolution of ageing , and evolvability . [ 11 ] 
 Second, biologists ask the most straightforward evolutionary question: "what happened and when?". This includes fields such as paleobiology , as well as systematics and phylogenetics . 
 Third, the modern evolutionary synthesis was devised at a time when nobody understood the molecular basis of genes. Today, evolutionary biologists try to determine the genetic architecture of interesting evolutionary phenomena such as adaptation and speciation . They seek answers to questions such as how many genes are involved, how large are the effects of each gene, to what extent are the effects of different genes interdependent, what sort of function do the genes involved tend to have, and what sort of changes tend to happen to them (e.g. point mutations vs. gene duplication or even genome duplication ). Evolutionary biologists try to reconcile the high heritability seen in twin studies with the difficulty in finding which genes are responsible for this heritability using genome-wide association studies . [ 12 ] 
 One challenge in studying genetic architecture is that the classical population genetics that catalyzed the modern evolutionary synthesis needs to be updated to take into account modern molecular knowledge. This requires a great deal of mathematical development, in order to relate DNA sequence data to evolutionary theory as part of a theory of molecular evolution . For example, biologists try to infer which genes have been under strong selection by detecting selective sweeps . [ 13 ] 
 Fourth, the modern evolutionary synthesis involved agreement about which forces contribute to evolution, but not about their relative importance. [ 14 ] Current research seeks to determine this. Evolutionary forces include natural selection , sexual selection , genetic drift , genetic draft , developmental constraints, mutation bias and biogeography . 
 An evolutionary approach is also key to much current research in biology that does not set out to study evolution per se, especially in organismal biology and ecology . For example, evolutionary thinking is key to life history theory . Annotation of genes and their function relies heavily on comparative, i.e. evolutionary, approaches. The field of evo-devo investigates how developmental processes work by using the comparative method to determine how they evolved.

 1. About PLOS Biology 

 PLOS Biology is an open-access* journal published by the PLOS . The journal features works of exceptional significance, originality, and relevance in all areas of biological science, from molecules to ecosystems, including works at the interface of other disciplines, such as chemistry, medicine, and mathematics. Our audience is the international scientific community as well as educators, policy makers, patient advocacy groups, and interested members of the public around the world. 

 * Open access means that every paper is freely available for everyone to read, download, copy, distribute and use. 


 
 2. Criteria for Publication 

 PLOS Biology is highly selective in the manuscripts that it publishes; rejection rates are high. To be considered for publication in PLOS Biology , any given manuscript must be exceptional in the following ways: 
 
 Originality 
 Importance to researchers in its field 
 Interest to scientists outside the field 
 Rigorous methodology and substantial evidence for its conclusions 
 

 
 3. Presubmission Inquiries 

 We strongly encourage authors to submit a presubmission
 inquiry before making a full submission. The purpose of a
 presubmission inquiry is to solicit rapid feedback from the staff
 editors about the potential suitability of a manuscript for the
 journal. 
 Please see this PLOS Biologue article by Chief Editor Theo Bloom for further guidelines. 
 Presubmission inquiries will be assessed for suitability
 in the context of the publishing mission of PLOS
 Biology : to publish exceptional research across all areas of
 the life sciences, with a particular emphasis on those areas for
 which unrestricted access is especially important to the research
 community or to the general public. Suitable papers will include
 substantial new conceptual or mechanistic insight, which
 significantly advance one or more particular fields, or will
 represent an application that is of fundamental importance to a
 field. If you wish to submit a presubmission inquiry, please log
 into the PLOS Biology online submission
 system and select "Submit New Manuscript" from your
 homepage, and then choose the "Presubmission Inquiry" article type. 

 Please note that a positive response from a staff editor is
 not a commitment to peer-review the article formally, but it is
 an expression of interest on the basis of the information you
 provide in the presubmission inquiry. The specific information we
 require is listed below. It is therefore in your interest to
 outline the importance of your claims, with reference to related
 work, and to describe the evidence you present in support of your
 conclusions as objectively as possible. Providing relevant
 information will save you time and help to ensure that the
 editors give you a response that is appropriate to the content of
 your article. Please also ensure that you check the remit of
 other PLOS
 journals before submitting to PLOS Biology . 

 To be of most use to authors and editors, presubmission
 inquiries should consist of the following: 

 A) A COVER LETTER of approximately 600 words that
 provides brief answers to the following questions: 

 
  What is the scientific question you are addressing? 

  What is the key finding that answers this question? 

  What is the nature of the evidence you provide in support
 of your conclusion? 

  What are the three most recently published papers that are
 relevant to this question? 

  What significance do your results have for the field? 

  What significance do your results have for the broader
 community (of biologists and/or the public)? 

  What other novel findings do you present? 

  Is there additional information that we should take into
 account? 
 

 You may also include in the cover letter requests to exclude
 specific scientists from the evaluation process. Please provide a
 reason for doing so. Please also read our policy
 about competing interests before submitting your inquiry. 

 B) A REFERENCED ABSTRACT of
 approximately 300 words . For the
 purpose of the presubmission inquiry submission form, the
 referenced abstract will be your "article file" and should
 include up to 10 key references that put your work into context.
 Please do not submit your entire manuscript. The
 abstract should be structured as follows: 
 
  Background 
 This section should describe clearly the
 rationale for the study being done and the previous work relevant
 to the study. It should end with a statement of the specific
 question or hypothesis being addressed. 

  Methodology/Principal Findings 
 Mention the techniques
 used without going into extensive methodological detail, and
 outline the most important results. Include sample sizes for key
 experiments as appropriate. Please also outline any limitations
 of the study that may have a bearing on the results. 

  Conclusions/Significance 
 Provide the take-home
 message of your article as clearly as possible. You may also
 include a brief, more general interpretation of the results and /
 or specific recommendations for future research. Please note,
 however, that the editors will pay most attention to the direct
 conclusions of the work being presented, rather than some
 possible future avenues being opened. 
 
 C) YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION. Even though the form allows you
 to enter information for all authors who contributed to the
 manuscript, you need only enter information for the
 corresponding author. 


 If you have any questions or require assistance with the
 presubmission inquiry process, please e-mail
 plosbiology[at]plos.org. 

 Authors who receive an invitation to submit their full
 manuscripts will then enter the regular editorial process. 



 
 4. Overview of the Editorial Process 

 Our aim is to provide all authors with an efficient, courteous, and constructive editorial process. To ensure the fairest and most objective decision-making, the editorial process is run as a partnership between the PLOS Biology professional editors and the Editorial Board , which is comprised of leaders in all fields of biology. 
 The ultimate responsibility for the PLOS Biology content and editorial decision-making lies with the team of professional editors. 

 On checking the status of a manuscript in our submission system, one of several status descriptions will appear. These correspond to the steps in the editorial process as follows: 
 1) Status descriptions With Editor or Editor Invited 
 Submitted manuscripts will be assigned to one of the professional editors, who will, in consultation with colleagues as appropriate, aim to make an initial evaluation of the paper within a maximum of 7 working days. If the editors feel the manuscript has the potential to fit within the scope of our journal , they will seek advice from an external Academic Editor, who is usually a member of the Editorial Board , and decide if the work is likely to meet the requirement of providing a major advance in its field and describing a sufficient body of work to support the main claims. Since Academic Editors are busy working scientists, and from time to time the opinion of experts not on the Board has to be sought, there is a possibility of some delay at this stage; however, we do try to avoid this where we can and ensure that appropriate expert advice is secured as promptly as possible. 
 Academic Editors retain anonymity unless a paper is accepted for publication. The name of the Academic Editor is noted on each published paper. 

 2) Under Review 
 If the Academic Editor and professional editors agree that the paper meets the standards to justify review at PLOS Biology , it will be sent out for more detailed peer review. Should your paper be sent for review, you will be informed of this by email. 

 Expert reviewers will be asked to assess the technical and scientific merits of the work. We ask that review comments be returned within 10 days; however, this is not always possible for all reviewers, and in the interests of securing the best expert advice we do grant extensions where necessary. However, we also actively chase review comments when overdue to ensure that this requirement is balanced with that of fairness to authors. 

 3) Required Reviews Complete 
 Once all reviews of a manuscript have been received, the manuscript returns to the professional editors, who evaluate and consider the reviews. In some cases they may consult the Academic Editor for their opinion on the reviews prior to drafting a decision; in all cases, expert input from the Academic Editor is then sought on the drafted decision letter before finalizing it and sending it to the authors. Although we endeavor to make all decisions promptly, there may be some to-and-fro between editors, and it may be necessary to clarify issues with reviewers, before a final decision is made. 
 4) Status is Accept, Reject or Revise 
 This status description appears where a decision on the manuscript has been finalized and sent. If you see this status description on your manuscript but have not received a decision, please email plosbiology [at] plos.org . 


 There are several types of decisions possible: accept the paper as submitted; accept it with revision; invite the authors to revise the manuscript prior to the final decision; reject the manuscript, but with encouragement to resubmit it after extensive revision; or reject the manuscript outright, typically because it does not meet the criteria outlined above of originality, importance to the field, cross-disciplinary interest, or sound methodology. If the decision is to allow resubmission, the author will be advised in the decision letter whether the paper is likely to require further peer review at that time. The revised manuscript in all cases will be assessed by a professional editor and Academic Editor. Sometimes, re-review will be required, but in general we aim to make decisions without involving multiple rounds of review. 
 Upon acceptance, the manuscript enters our production system. Articles are typically published online within 6 weeks of formal acceptance, and usually before they are assembled into a complete monthly issue.
 
 Appeals of Decisions 
 If you wish to appeal a decision, you should contact the professional editor who handled the presubmission inquiry or full manuscript, explaining in detail your reasons for the appeal. Appeals will only be considered when a reviewer or editor is thought to have made a significant factual error or when his/her objectivity is compromised by a documented competing interest, and when a reversal based on either of these grounds would change the original decision. 
 All appeals will be discussed with at least one other professional editor; if those editors do not agree the appeal will be discussed at a full editorial meeting. Priority is given to new submissions to the journal, and the processing of appeals will usually take longer than the original submission. We hope, however, that this will not take longer than two weeks. While under appeal, a manuscript remains under formal consideration at PLOS Biology and hence should not be submitted for consideration elsewhere. We may or may not seek external advice on appeals, and we do not consider second appeals. 

 


 
 5. Preparation of Research Manuscripts 

 PLOS Biology publishes original research articles of outstanding scientific significance. We will consider manuscripts of any length; we encourage the submission of both substantial full-length bodies of work and shorter manuscripts that report novel findings that might be based on a more limited range of experiments. The key criteria are that the work clearly demonstrates its novelty, its importance to a particular field as well as its interest to those outside that discipline, and conclusions that are justified by the study. 
 
 The writing style should be concise and accessible. Editors will make suggestions for how to achieve this, as well as suggestions for cuts or additions that could be made to the article to strengthen the argument. Our aim is to make the editorial process rigorous and consistent, but not intrusive or overbearing. Authors are encouraged to use their own voice and to decide how best to present their ideas, results, and conclusions. 

 Although we encourage submissions from around the globe, we require that manuscripts be submitted in English. As a step towards overcoming language barriers, we encourage authors fluent in other languages to provide copies of their full articles or abstracts in other languages. Translations should be submitted as supporting information and listed, together with other supporting information files, at the end of the article text. 

 
 Article File 

 Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC, LaTeX) of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. Please see our LaTeX guidelines for further information on LaTeX file requirements at acceptance. 

 Math Equations and DOCX 

 If your manuscript is or will be in DOCX and contains equations, you must follow the instructions below to make sure that your equations are editable when the file enters production. 
 If you have not yet composed your article, you can ensure that the equations in your DOCX file remain editable in DOC by enabling &ldquo;Compatibility Mode&rdquo; before you begin. To do this, open a new document and save as Word 97-2003 (*.doc). Several features of Word 2007/10 will now be inactive, including the built-in equation editing tool. You can insert equations in one of the two ways listed below. 
 If you have already composed your article as DOCX and used its built-in equation editing tool, your equations will become images when the file is saved down to DOC. To resolve this problem, re-key your equations in one of the two following ways. 
 
 
 Use MathType to create the equation. MathType is the recommended method for creating equations. 
 Go to Insert &gt; Object &gt; Microsoft Equation 3.0 and create the equation. 
 
 If, when saving your final document, you see a message saying &ldquo;Equations will be converted to images,&rdquo; your equations are no longer editable and PLOS will not be able to accept your file. 




 Organization of the Manuscript 

 Most articles published in PLOS Biology will be organized into the following sections: Title, authors, affiliations, abstract, introduction, results, discussion, materials and methods, references, acknowledgments, and figure legends. Uniformity in format will facilitate the experience of readers and users of the journal. Page numbers are required for all sections (figures exempted). There are no specific length restrictions for the overall manuscript or individual sections. However, we urge authors to present and discuss their findings concisely. We recognize that some works will not be best presented in our research article format. If you have a manuscript that would benefit from a different format, please contact the editors to discuss this further. 

 Our submission system can support a large range of formats for text and graphics, but if you experience difficulties with the site or are concerned about the suitability of your files, please contact the editorial department plosbiology [at] plos.org . 

 
Please submit your manuscript with double spacing (a blank line under each line of text) for the convenience of the editors and any reviewers. 

 Title (150 characters, including spaces) 

 The title should be specific to the project yet concise. It should be comprehensible to readers outside your field. Avoid specialist abbreviations, if possible. Titles should be presented in title case, meaning that all words except for prepositions, articles, and conjunctions should be capitalized. 

 Example: 
Detection of Specific Sequences among DNA Fragments Separated by Gel Electrophoresis. 

 Please also provide a brief "running head" of approximately 50 characters. If your article is published, this will appear as a heading on each page of the paper.
 

 Authors and Affiliations 

 PLOS journals follow the COPE guidelines covering
 changes in authorship. Please note that if any changes to the
 list of authors of a manuscript are necessary after the initial
 submission of a manuscript to a PLOS journal but before its
 publication, the corresponding author must first contact the
 journal staff and provide a clear reason for the change(s). If
 the change to the authorship list is appropriate and in keeping
 with the guidelines above, the corresponding author will be asked
 to provide written confirmation that all other authors listed on
 the manuscript at that time consent to the change(s). Any
 individuals who the corresponding author requests to add or
 remove from the list of authors will be contacted. 

 Provide the first names or initials (if used), middle names or initials (if used), surnames, and affiliations &mdash; department, university or organization, city, state/province (if applicable), and country &mdash; for all authors. The information entered into our online system must be correct, as it will be published for accepted papers. If you require assistance in correcting author affiliations, etc. please contact our editorial team at plosbiology [at] plos.org . 

 One author should be designated as the corresponding author. It is the corresponding author's responsibility to ensure that the author list, and the summary of the author contributions to the study are accurate and complete. If the article has been submitted on behalf of a consortium, all consortium members and affiliations should be listed after the Acknowledgments.
 

 Abstract 

 The abstract succinctly introduces the paper. It should mention the techniques used without going into methodological detail and mention the most important results. The abstract is conceptually divided into the following three sections: Background, Methodology/Principal Findings, and Conclusions/Significance. However, the abstract should be written as a single paragraph without these headers. Please do not include any citations in the abstract. Avoid specialist abbreviations. Please note that the Abstract and Author Summary are not required for article types other than research articles; see our guidelines for other article types . 
 
 Author Summary 

 We ask that authors submitting revised manuscripts include a 150-200 word non-technical summary of the work as a separate file, uploaded as a Related Manuscript File, with the title "Author Summary". Subject to editorial review, this short text is published with all research articles as a highlighted text box. The Author Summary is not needed for article types other than research articles, primers, and select front matter articles. 

 Distinct from the scientific abstract, the author summary is included in the article to make findings accessible to an audience of both scientists and non-scientists. Ideally aimed to a level of understanding of an undergraduate student, the significance of the work should be presented simply, objectively, and without exaggeration. 

 
Authors should avoid the use of acronyms and complex scientific terms and write the text using a first person voice. Authors may benefit from consulting with a science writer or press officer to ensure they effectively communicate their findings to a general audience. We encourage you to look at two examples of summaries currently online in PLOS Biology. These examples should help you determine the level we are aiming for: 

 
 Example 1 
 Example 2 
 

 Blurb 

 In addition to the Author Summary, we require a brief statement ("blurb") about the work. The blurbs will be included in our weekly and monthly Electronic Table of Contents, sent out to users signed up to receive alerts from PLOS Biology . The blurb should be about 20 to 30 words long and is subject to editorial changes. It should, without exaggeration, entice people to read your manuscript. It should not be redundant with the title and should not contain acronyms or abbreviations. The following examples should help you determine the style we are looking for: 

 
 During embryonic development of the motor system of Drosophila , motorneurons target their dendrites to different regions along the body axis in response to midline guidance cues. 
 A neuroimaging study reveals novel insights into how the brain responds to an anticipated event, such as a starting gun or responding to a green light. 
 Computational modeling and experimentation in a model system for actin-based force generation explain how actin networks initiate and maintain directional movement. 
 

 For further examples, please view the blurbs accompanying the articles on the homepage of PLOS Biology . 

 Please submit your Blurb as a sentence or two, at the bottom of the document containing your Author Summary, under the heading "Blurb." 

 Introduction 

 The introduction should put the focus of the manuscript into a broader context. As you compose the introduction, think of readers who are not experts in this field. Include a brief review of the key literature. If there are relevant controversies or disagreements in the field, they should be mentioned so that a non-expert reader can delve into these issues further. The introduction should conclude with a brief statement of the overall aim of the experiments and a comment about whether that aim was achieved. 
 
 Results 

 The results section should provide details of all of the experiments that are required to support the conclusions of the paper. There is no specific word limit for this section, but details of experiments that are peripheral to the main thrust of the article and that detract from the focus of the article should not be included. The section may be divided into subsections, each with a concise subheading. Large datasets, including raw data, should be submitted as supplemental files; these are published online alongside the accepted article. The results section should be written in past tense. 
 
 Discussion 

 The discussion should spell out the major conclusions and interpretations of the work including some explanation on the significance of these conclusions. How do the conclusions affect the existing assumptions and models in the field? How can future research build on these observations? What are the key experiments that must be done? The discussion should be concise and tightly argued. If warranted, the results and discussion may be combined into one section. 
 
 Materials and Methods 

 This section should provide enough detail for reproduction of the findings. Protocols for new methods should be included, but well-established protocols may simply be referenced. We encourage authors to submit, as separate files, detailed protocols for newer or less well-established methods. These will be published online linked to the article and will be fully searchable. 
 
 Acknowledgments 
 People who contributed to the work, but do not fit the criteria for authors should be listed in the Acknowledgments, along with their contributions. You must also ensure that anyone named in the acknowledgments agrees to being so named. The Acknowledgments section is reserved for statements of gratitude or thanks. Details of the funding sources that have supported the work should be confined to the funding statement. Do not include them in the Acknowledgments.
 


 
 References 
 Only published or accepted manuscripts should be included in the reference list. Papers that have been submitted but not yet accepted should not be cited. Limited citation of unpublished work should be included in the body of the text only as &ldquo;unpublished data.&rdquo; All &ldquo;personal communications&rdquo; citations should be supported by a letter from the relevant authors. 

 Style information: 

 
 PLOS uses the numbered citation (citation-sequence) method and first five authors, et al. 
 References are listed and numbered in the order that they appear in the text. 
 In the text, citations should be indicated by the reference number in brackets. 
 The parts of the manuscript should be in the correct order before ordering the citations: body, boxes, figure captions, tables, and supporting information captions. 
 Abstracts and author summaries may not contain citations. 
 Journal name abbreviations should be those found in the NCBI databases: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/journals . 
 

 Because all references will be linked electronically as much as possible to the papers they cite, proper formatting of the references is crucial. For convenience, a number of reference software companies supply PLOS style files (e.g., Reference Manager , EndNote ).

 Financial Disclosure 
 This section should describe sources of funding that have supported the work. Please include relevant grant numbers and the URL of any funder's Web site. Please also include this sentence: "The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript." If this statement is not correct, you must describe the role of any sponsors or funders, and amend the aforementioned sentence as needed. 

 Competing Interest 
 Authors are asked at submission to declare whether they have any financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced their paper. Reviewers are also asked to declare any interests that might interfere with their objective assessment of a manuscript. Any relevant competing interests of authors must be available to editors and reviewers during the review process and will be stated in published articles. Click here for more general information on PLOS’s policy regarding competing interests. 

 Abbreviations 
 Please keep abbreviations to a minimum. List all non-standard abbreviations in alphabetical order, along with their expanded form. Define them as well upon first use in the text. Non-standard abbreviations should not be used unless they appear at least three times in the text. 

 Priority Claims 
Manuscripts should not include priority claims. For example, "the first demonstration of this" should be changed to "the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of this."

 
 Nomenclature 
 The use of standardized nomenclature in all fields of science and medicine is an essential step toward the integration and linking of scientific information reported in published literature. We will enforce the use of correct and established nomenclature wherever possible: 
 
 We strongly encourage the use of SI units . If you do not use these exclusively, please provide the SI value in parentheses after each value. 
 Species names should be italicized (e.g., Homo sapiens ) and the full genus and species must be written out in full, both in the title of the manuscript and at the first mention of an organism in a paper; after that, the first letter of the genus name, followed by the full species name may be used. 
 Genes, mutations, genotypes, and alleles should be indicated in italics. Use the recommended name by consulting the appropriate genetic nomenclature database, e.g., HUGO for human genes. It is sometimes advisable to indicate the synonyms for the gene the first time it appears in the text. Gene prefixes such as those used for oncogenes or cellular localization should be shown in roman: v-fes, c-MYC, etc. 
 The Recommended International Non-Proprietary Name (rINN) of drugs should be provided. 
 

 
 Accession Numbers 
 All appropriate datasets, images, and information should be deposited in public resources. Please provide the relevant accession numbers (and version numbers, if appropriate). Accession numbers should be provided in parentheses after the entity on first use. Suggested databases include, but are not limited to: 

 
 ArrayExpress 
 BioModels Database 
 Database of Interacting Proteins 
 DNA Data Bank of Japan [DDBJ] 
 DRYAD 
 EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database 
 GenBank 
 Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] 
 Protein Data Bank 
 UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 
 ClinicalTrials.gov 
 

 In addition, as much as possible, please provide accession numbers or identifiers for all entities such as genes, proteins, mutants, diseases, etc., for which there is an entry in a public database, for example: 

 
 Ensembl 
 Entrez Gene 
 FlyBase 
 InterPro 
 Mouse Genome Database (MGD) 
 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 
 PubChem 
 

 Providing accession numbers allows linking to and from established databases and integrates your article with a broader collection of scientific information. 

 
 Figures 
 Figures should be submitted either as .EPS or .TIFF files. If the article is accepted for publication, authors will be asked to supply high-resolution, print-ready versions of the figures. Please ensure that the files conform to our Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation when preparing your figures for production. 

 PLOS does not accept vector EPS figures generated using LaTeX. We only accept LaTeX generated figures in TIFF format. Export your LaTeX files as PDFs, and then open them in GIMP or Photoshop and save as TIFF. In general, Figures must be generated in a standalone graphics application such as Adobe Illustrator, InkScape, PyMol, MatLab, SAS, etc. Please see our Figure Guidelines for more information. 

 All figures will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution License, which allows them to be freely used, distributed, and built upon as long as proper attribution is given. Please do not submit any figures that have been previously copyrighted unless you have express written permission from the copyright holder to publish under the CCAL license. 

 
 Figure Legends 
 The aim of the figure legend should be to describe the key messages of the figure, but the figure should also be discussed in the text. An enlarged version of the figure and its full legend will often be viewed in a separate window online, and it should be possible for a reader to understand the figure without switching back and forth between this window and the relevant parts of the text. Each legend should have a concise title of no more than 15 words. The legend itself should be succinct, while still explaining all symbols and abbreviations. Avoid lengthy descriptions of methods. 

 Tables 
 All tables should have a concise title. Footnotes can be used to explain abbreviations. Citations should be indicated using the same style as outlined above. Tables occupying more than one printed page should be avoided, if possible. Larger tables can be published as online supporting information. Tables must be cell-based; do not use picture elements, text boxes, tabs, or returns in tables. Please ensure that the files conform to our Guidelines for Figure and Table Preparation when preparing your tables for production. 

 
 Multimedia Files and Supporting Information 
 We encourage authors to submit essential supporting files and multimedia files along with their manuscripts. All supporting material will be subject to peer review, and should be smaller than 10 MB in size because of the difficulties that some users will experience in loading or downloading files of a greater size. 

 Supporting files should fall into one of the following categories: Dataset, Figure, Table, Text, Protocol, Audio, or Video. All supporting information should be referred to in the manuscript with a leading capital S (e.g., Figure S4 for the fourth supporting information figure). Titles (and, if desired, legends) for all supporting information files should be listed in the manuscript under the heading "Supporting Information." 

 Supporting files may be submitted in a variety of formats, but should be publication-ready, as these files are not copyedited. See the Figure Guidelines for more detail about our requirements for multimedia files and the file formats we accept. 
 
 
 6. Submission of Research Manuscripts 

 Are You Ready to Submit Your Manuscript? 

 We have provided an author
 checklist to help you prepare your materials for submission
 and to make the online submission process as straightforward as
 possible. Please take the time to look through the list before
 submitting your article. 

 We strongly encourage authors to submit 
 a presubmission inquiry before making a full submission. The
 purpose of a presubmission inquiry is to solicit rapid feedback
 from the staff editors about the potential suitability of a
 manuscript for the journal. 
 
 Cover Letter 

 Please include a cover letter of no more than 600
 words that provides brief answers to the following
 questions: 

 
  What is the scientific question you are addressing? 

  What is the key finding that answers this question? 

  What is the nature of the evidence you provide in support
 of your conclusion? 

  What are the three most recently published papers that are
 relevant to this question? 

  What significance do your results have for the field? 

  What significance do your results have for the broader
 community (of biologists and/or the public)? 

  What other novel findings do you present? 

  Is there additional information that we should take into
 account? 
 

 You may also include in the cover letter requests to exclude
 specific scientists from the evaluation process. Please provide a
 reason for doing so. Please also read our policy
 about competing interests before submitting your
 inquiry. 
 
 Electronic Submission 

 Detailed instructions for submission can be found on the PLOS Biology Manuscript Submission and Peer Review Web site. Files are uploaded individually and are combined into a single PDF file, which must be approved by the author at the end of the submission process. 

 LaTeX 

 Articles prepared in LaTeX may be submitted in PDF format for use during the review process. After acceptance, however, .tex files and formatting information will be required as a zipped file. Please consult our LaTeX Guidelines for a list of what will be required. 
 
 Hard copies of your manuscript are not required 

 Articles can be submitted for review in DOC, DOCX, RTF, or PDF. Any articles that have been prepared in LaTeX will be accepted for review, but only in PDF format. After acceptance, only text files (RTF or DOC, LaTeX) of the revised manuscript and tables can be accepted for use in the production process. Please see our LaTeX guidelines for further information on LaTeX file requirements at acceptance. 

 Tables for publication can be submitted in .DOC or.XLS formats. 

 Manuscript figure files can be submitted in the following formats: EPS or TIFF. Figures that are part of the Supporting Information can be submitted in any format.
 

 
 7. Other Article Types 

 While remaining scientifically rigorous, the magazine section of PLOS Biology is inclusive and accessible to a broad audience. All articles submitted to the magazine section should be directed at a readership that extends beyond the traditional research community and that includes scientific educators, students, physicians, patients, and the interested public. Most articles in the magazine section are peer reviewed. 

 The majority of articles in the magazine section of PLOS Biology are published by invitation only, but if you have a suggestion for a topic in any of the following categories, we will consider the idea. Please submit your suggestions for front matter via our online submission system as a presubmission inquiry. There is no publication fee for front matter articles. 

 For these article types, you do not need to include an Abstract or an Author Summary unless otherwise requested by an editor. You may find that some of the fields on the submission form are not appropriate to your front matter article&mdash;please enter a full stop/period in these boxes. If you have any questions about this process, please contact our publication assistants at plosbiology [at] plos.org . 

 Essays 

 PLOS Biology publishes visionary and provocative essays that cover broad topics of general interest to life scientists. Essays might explore the implications of recent advances in a given field or global methods that promise to have broad-ranging consequences across fields, investigate an emerging trend with cross-disciplinary implications, or explain the challenges of a nascent field. 

 Challenges Series 

 The Challenges Series, which appears periodically in the Essays section, features short articles highlighting fundamental challenges that cut across and help unify different sub-disciplines in biology. The series editor is Simon Levin. 

 Unsolved Mysteries 

 Unsolved Mysteries discuss a topic of biological importance that is poorly understood and in need of research attention, and may explore issues that have been ignored, pose technically and conceptually challenging questions, or involve puzzling phenomena with potentially devastating consequences. The articles are intended to stimulate students and other scientists to think about future research possibilities outside their areas of expertise. 

 Perspectives 

 Perspectives provide experts with a forum to comment on topical or controversial issues of broad interest. 

 Public Engagement 

 The Public Engagement with Science series, which appears periodically in the Perspectives section, investigates, through specific case studies, whether, and under what conditions, it is possible to engage the public in scientific issues in meaningful ways in decision-making about the innovation pathways of biosciences. The series is edited by Claire Marris and Nikolas Rose. 

 Primers 

 Primers provide concise and accessible background information for a particular area in biology that is featured in a PLOS Biology research article. Unsolicited primers are not considered. 

 Synopses 

 Selected PLOS Biology research articles are accompanied by a synopsis written for a general audience to provide non-experts with insight into the significance of the published work. They are commissioned only. 

 Editorials 

 Editorials are written in-house by members of the editorial staff or by members of the Editorial Board. 

 Book Review/Science in the Media 

 These short reviews critique books, films, plays, and other media that deal with some aspect of the biological sciences. 

 Community Pages 

 The Community Page is a forum for organizations and societies to highlight their efforts to enhance the dissemination and value of scientific knowledge. 

 Cool Tools Series 

 The Cool Tools Series, which appears periodically in the Community Page section, features innovative resources designed to enhance the understanding, dissemination, or practice of science. 

 Education Series 

 The Education Series takes full advantage of web-based open-access publishing to create an interactive, dynamic resource for educators, researchers, students, and the interested public to share and discuss key ideas, methods, tools, and activities to enhance understanding of fundamental questions in biology. Cheryl A. Kerfeld is the series editor. 

 Historical and Philosophical Perspectives 

 The Historical and Philosophical Perspectives section provides professional historians and philosophers of science with a forum to reflect on topical issues in contemporary biology. 

 Obituaries 




 
 8. Outline of the Production Process 

 Once an article has been accepted for publication, the manuscript files are transferred into our production system. Manuscripts are then copyedited by professional copyeditors who correspond directly with the authors concerning queries and corrections. Once the article has been typeset, PDF proofs are generated so that authors can approve the final article. The prompt return of proofs by authors will expedite the production process. PLOS permits only the following types of corrections to the PDF proofs: errors in author names or affiliations, errors to scientific fact that would cause misunderstandings to readers, and printer's (introduced) errors. Other correction requests will not be fulfilled. Therefore it is CRITICAL that you check your article Word file, the figures, and the tables very carefully when you see the copyedited article. Requests for corrections to any of these items may be denied once the article is in proofs.
 


 
 9. Reader Responses and Notes, Comments and Ratings 

 On the 28 th March 2009, the Reader Response functionality on PLOS Biology articles was discontinued in preparation for our launch on a new publishing platform that features a number of 'Web 2.0' tools to facilitate community evaluation and discourse around published articles. 
 All the Reader Response contributions that were in our archive are now available as comments directly added to the relevant article. 
 To contribute to an existing discussion about an article or to start a new one, see the guidelines explaining how you can add Notes, Comments and Ratings to any PLOS Biology article.

Natural and sexual selection are often presumed to act most directly on behavior (e.g., what an animal chooses to do when confronted by a predator), which is expressed within limits set by whole- organism performance abilities (e.g., how fast it can run) that are determined by subordinate traits (e.g., muscle fiber-type composition). A weakness of this conceptual and operational model is the absence of an explicit recognition of the place of life history traits.

 Evolutionary physiology is the study of physiological evolution , which is to say, the manner in which the functional characteristics of individuals in a population of organisms have responded to selection across multiple generations during the history of the population. [ 1 ] 
 It is a subdiscipline of both physiology and evolutionary biology . Practitioners in this field come from a variety of backgrounds, including physiology, evolutionary biology, ecology and genetics . 
 Accordingly, the range of phenotypes studied by evolutionary physiologists is broad, including but not limited to life history , behavior, whole-organism performance, functional morphology , biomechanics , anatomy , classical physiology, endocrinology , biochemistry , and molecular evolution . It is closely related to comparative physiology and environmental physiology , and its findings are a major concern of evolutionary medicine .

 [ edit ] History 
 As the name implies, evolutionary physiology is the product of what was at one time two distinct scientific disciplines. According to Garland and Carter, [ 1 ] evolutionary physiology arose in the late 1970s, following "heated" debates concerning the metabolic and thermoregulatory status of dinosaurs (see physiology of dinosaurs ) and mammal-like reptiles . 
 This period was followed by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate quantitative genetics into evolutionary biology , which had spill-over effects on other fields, such as behavioral ecology and ecophysiology . In the mid- to late-1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods started to become popular in many fields, including physiological ecology and comparative physiology . An 1987 volume titled "New Directions in Ecological Physiology" [ 2 ] had little ecology but a considerable emphasis on evolutionary topics. It generated vigorous debate, and within a few years the National Science Foundation had developed a panel titled Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology . 
 Shortly thereafter, selection experiments and experimental evolution became increasingly common in evolutionary physiology. Most recently, "macrophysiology" has emerged as a subdiscipline, in which practitioners attempt to identify large-scale patterns in physiological traits (e.g., patterns of covariation with latitude ) and their ecological implications. [ 3 ] 
 [ edit ] Emergent properties 
 As a hybrid scientific discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives. For example, an understanding of physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or covariation (such as an allometric relationship) represents what could possibly exist or just what selection has allowed. [ 1 ] Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible for many of the traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as morphology ). 
 [ edit ] Areas of Research 
 Important areas of current research include: 
 
 Organismal performance as a central phenotype (e.g., measures of speed or stamina in animal locomotion ) 
 Role of behavior in physiological evolution 
 Physiological and endocrinological basis of variation in life history traits (e.g., clutch size ) 
 Functional significance of molecular evolution 
 Extent to which species differences are adaptive 
 Physiological underpinnings of limits to geographic ranges 
 Role of sexual selection in shaping physiological evolution 
 Magnitude of "phylogenetic signal" in physiological traits 
 Role of pathogens and parasites in physiological evolution and immunity 
 Application of optimality modeling to elucidate the degree of adaptation 
 Role of phenotypic plasticity in accounting for species differences 
 Mechanistic basis of trade-offs and constraints on evolution (e.g., putative Carrier's constraint on running and breathing) 
 Limits on sustained metabolic rate 
 Origin of allometric scaling relations or allometric laws (and the so-called metabolic theory of ecology ) 
 Individual variation (see also Individual differences psychology )

Natural and sexual selection are often presumed to act most directly on behavior (e.g., what an animal chooses to do when confronted by a predator), which is expressed within limits set by whole- organism performance abilities (e.g., how fast it can run) that are determined by subordinate traits (e.g., muscle fiber-type composition). A weakness of this conceptual and operational model is the absence of an explicit recognition of the place of life history traits.

 Evolutionary physiology is the study of physiological evolution , which is to say, the manner in which the functional characteristics of individuals in a population of organisms have responded to selection across multiple generations during the history of the population. [ 1 ] 
 It is a subdiscipline of both physiology and evolutionary biology . Practitioners in this field come from a variety of backgrounds, including physiology, evolutionary biology, ecology and genetics . 
 Accordingly, the range of phenotypes studied by evolutionary physiologists is broad, including but not limited to life history , behavior, whole-organism performance, functional morphology , biomechanics , anatomy , classical physiology, endocrinology , biochemistry , and molecular evolution . It is closely related to comparative physiology and environmental physiology , and its findings are a major concern of evolutionary medicine .

 [ edit ] History 
 As the name implies, evolutionary physiology is the product of what was at one time two distinct scientific disciplines. According to Garland and Carter, [ 1 ] evolutionary physiology arose in the late 1970s, following "heated" debates concerning the metabolic and thermoregulatory status of dinosaurs (see physiology of dinosaurs ) and mammal-like reptiles . 
 This period was followed by attempts in the early 1980s to integrate quantitative genetics into evolutionary biology , which had spill-over effects on other fields, such as behavioral ecology and ecophysiology . In the mid- to late-1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods started to become popular in many fields, including physiological ecology and comparative physiology . An 1987 volume titled "New Directions in Ecological Physiology" [ 2 ] had little ecology but a considerable emphasis on evolutionary topics. It generated vigorous debate, and within a few years the National Science Foundation had developed a panel titled Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology . 
 Shortly thereafter, selection experiments and experimental evolution became increasingly common in evolutionary physiology. Most recently, "macrophysiology" has emerged as a subdiscipline, in which practitioners attempt to identify large-scale patterns in physiological traits (e.g., patterns of covariation with latitude ) and their ecological implications. [ 3 ] 
 [ edit ] Emergent properties 
 As a hybrid scientific discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives. For example, an understanding of physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or covariation (such as an allometric relationship) represents what could possibly exist or just what selection has allowed. [ 1 ] Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible for many of the traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as morphology ). 
 [ edit ] Areas of Research 
 Important areas of current research include: 
 
 Organismal performance as a central phenotype (e.g., measures of speed or stamina in animal locomotion ) 
 Role of behavior in physiological evolution 
 Physiological and endocrinological basis of variation in life history traits (e.g., clutch size ) 
 Functional significance of molecular evolution 
 Extent to which species differences are adaptive 
 Physiological underpinnings of limits to geographic ranges 
 Role of sexual selection in shaping physiological evolution 
 Magnitude of "phylogenetic signal" in physiological traits 
 Role of pathogens and parasites in physiological evolution and immunity 
 Application of optimality modeling to elucidate the degree of adaptation 
 Role of phenotypic plasticity in accounting for species differences 
 Mechanistic basis of trade-offs and constraints on evolution (e.g., putative Carrier's constraint on running and breathing) 
 Limits on sustained metabolic rate 
 Origin of allometric scaling relations or allometric laws (and the so-called metabolic theory of ecology ) 
 Individual variation (see also Individual differences psychology ) 
 Functional significance of biochemical polymorphisms 
 Analysis of physiological variation via quantitative genetics 
 Paleophysiology and the evolution of endothermy 
 Human adaptational physiology 
 Darwinian medicine 
 Evolution of dietary antioxidants

 [ edit ] Funding and Societies 
 In the United States, research in evolutionary physiology is funded mainly by the National Science Foundation . A number of scientific societies feature sections that encompass evolutionary physiology, including: 
 
 American Physiological Society "integrating the life sciences from molecule to organism" 
 Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology 
 Society for Experimental Biology

 Biological classification , or scientific classification in biology , is a method of scientific taxonomy used to group and categorize organisms into groups such as genus or species . These groups are known as taxa (singular: taxon ). 
 Modern biological classification has its root in the work of Carolus Linnaeus , who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to improve consistency with the Darwinian principle of common descent . With the introduction of the cladistic method in the late 20th century, phylogenetic taxonomy in which organisms are grouped based purely on inferred evolutionary relatedness, ignoring morphological similarity, has become common in some areas of biology. [ 1 ]  Molecular phylogenetics , which uses DNA sequences as data, has also driven many recent revisions and is likely to continue doing so. Biological classification belongs to the science of biological systematics .

 [ edit ] Definition 
 Classification has been defined by Ernst Mayr as "The arrangement of entities in a hierarchical series of nested classes, in which similar or related classes at one hierarchical level are combined comprehensively into more inclusive classes at the next higher level." A class is defined as "a collection of similar entities". [ 2 ] (Note that the word " class " is used quite separately for one of the levels in the biological hierarchy.) 
 Biological classification is based on shared descent from their nearest common ancestor. Accordingly, the important attributes or traits for biological classification are ' homologous ', i.e.,&#160;inherited from common ancestors. [ 3 ] These must be separated from traits that are analogous . Thus birds and bats both have the power of flight, but this similarity is not used to classify them into a taxon (a "class"), because it is not inherited from a common ancestor. In spite of all the other differences between them, the fact that bats and whales both feed their young on milk is one of the features used to classify both of them as mammals, since it was inherited from a common ancestor(s). 
 Determining whether similarities are homologous or analogous can be difficult. Thus until recently, golden moles , found in South Africa, were placed in the same taxon ( insectivores ) as Northern Hemisphere moles , on the basis of morphological and behavioural similarities. However, molecular analysis has shown that they are not closely related, so that their similarities must be due to convergent evolution and not to shared descent, and so should not be used to place them in the same taxon. [ 4 ] 
 [ edit ] Biological types 
 Main article: Type (biology) 
 The scientific names of taxa are formally attached to a type , which is one particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens, or in some cases an illustration) of the organism, preserved in a museum. The type is the example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of each particular taxon. 
 [ edit ] Taxonomic ranks 
 Main article: Taxonomic rank 
 A classification as defined above is hierarchical. In a biological classification, rank is the level (the relative position) in a hierarchy. (Rarely, the term "taxonomic category" is used instead of rank.) The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank, in the nomenclatural sense, as: 
 
 The level, for nomenclatural purposes, of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy (e.g.,&#160;all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank, which lies between superfamily and subfamily). [ 5 ] 
 
 There are seven main ranks defined by the international nomenclature codes : kingdom , phylum/division , class , order , family , genus , species . " Domain ", a level above kingdom, has become popular in recent years, but has not been accepted into the codes. Ranks between the seven main ones can be produced by adding prefixes such as "super-", "sub-" or "infra-". Thus a subclass has a rank between class and order, a superfamily between order and family. There are slightly different ranks for zoology and for botany, including subdivisions such as tribe . 
 Ranks are somewhat arbitrary, but hope to encapsulate the diversity contained within a group—a rough measure of the number of diversifications that the group has been through. [ 6 ]

 Aristotle , 384–322 BC. 
 
 
 Current systems of classifying forms of life descend from the thought presented by the Greek philosopher Aristotle , who published in his metaphysical works the first known classification of everything whatsoever, or "being". This is the scheme that gave such words as "'substance", "species", and "genus", and was retained in modified and less general form by Linnaeus . 
 Aristotle also studied animals and classified them according to method of reproduction, as did Linnaeus later with plants. Aristotle's animal classification was eventually made obsolete by additional knowledge and forgotten. 
 The philosophical classification, in brief, is as follows: [ 7 ] Primary substance is the individual being; for example, Peter, Paul, etc. Secondary substance is a predicate that can properly or characteristically be said of a class of primary substances; for example, man of Peter, Paul, etc. The characteristic must not be merely in the individual; for example, being skilled in grammar. Grammatical skill leaves most of Peter out and therefore is not characteristic of him. Similarly man (all of mankind) is not in Peter; rather, he is in man. 
 Species is the secondary substance that is most proper to its individuals. The most characteristic thing that can be said of Peter is that Peter is a man. An identity is being postulated: "man" is equal to all its individuals and only those individuals. Members of a species differ only in number but are totally the same type. 
 Genus is a secondary substance less characteristic of and more general than the species; for example, man is an animal, but not all animals are men. It is clear that a genus contains species. There is no limit to the number of Aristotelian genera that might be found to contain the species. Aristotle does not structure the genera into phylum , class, etc., as the Linnaean classification does. 
 The secondary substance that distinguishes one species from another within a genus is the specific difference. Man can thus be comprehended as the sum of specific differences (the "differentiae" of biology) in less and less general categories. This sum is the definition; for example, man is an animate, sensate, rational substance. The most characteristic definition contains the species and the next most general genus: man is a rational animal. Definition is thus based on the unity problem: the species is but one yet has many differentiae. 
 The very top genera are the categories . There are ten: one of substance and nine of "accidents", universals that must be "in" a substance. Substances exist by themselves; accidents are only in them: quantity, quality, etc. There is no higher category, "being", because of the following problem, which was only solved in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas : a specific difference is not characteristic of its genus. If man is a rational animal, then rationality is not a property of animals. Substance therefore cannot be a kind of being because it can have no specific difference, which would have to be non -being. 
 The problem of "being" occupied the attention of scholastics during the time of the Middle Ages. The solution of St. Thomas, termed the analogy of being, established the field of ontology , which received the better part of the publicity and also drew the line between philosophy and experimental science. The latter rose in the Renaissance from practical technique. Linnaeus, a classical scholar, combined the two on the threshold of the neo-classicist revival now called the Age of Enlightenment .

Rhinoceros in Conrad Gesner's Historiae animalium , 1551 
 
 
 An important advance was made by the Swiss professor, Conrad von Gesner (1516–1565). Gesner's work was a critical compilation of life known at the time. 
 The exploration of parts of the New World by Europeans produced large numbers of new plants and animals that needed descriptions and classification. The old systems made it difficult to study and locate all these new specimens within a collection and often the same plants or animals were given different names simply because there were too many species to keep track of. A system was needed that could group these specimens together so they could be found; the binomial system was developed based on morphology with groups having similar appearances. In the latter part of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th, careful study of animals commenced, which, directed first to familiar kinds, was gradually extended until it formed a sufficient body of knowledge to serve as an anatomical basis for classification. Advances in using this knowledge to classify living beings bear a debt to the research of medical anatomists, such as Fabricius (1537–1619), Petrus Severinus (1580–1656), William Harvey (1578–1657), and Edward Tyson (1649–1708). Advances in classification due to the work of entomologists and the first microscopists is due to the research of people like Marcello Malpighi (1628–1694), Jan Swammerdam (1637–1680), and Robert Hooke (1635–1702). Lord Monboddo (1714–1799) was one of the early abstract thinkers whose works illustrate the knowledge of species relationships and who foreshadowed the theory of evolution . [ 8 ] 
 [ edit ] Early methodists 
 Since late in the 15th century, a number of authors had become concerned with what they called methodus, (method). By method authors mean an arrangement of minerals, plants, and animals according to the principles of logical division. The term Methodists was coined by Carolus Linnaeus in his Bibliotheca Botanica to denote the authors who care about the principles of classification (in contrast to the mere collectors who are concerned primarily with the description of plants paying little or no attention to their arrangement into genera, etc.). Important early Methodists were Italian philosopher, physician, and botanist Andrea Caesalpino , English naturalist John Ray , German physician and botanist Augustus Quirinus Rivinus , and French physician, botanist, and traveller Joseph Pitton de Tournefort . 
 Andrea Caesalpino (1519–1603) in his De plantis libri XVI (1583) proposed the first methodical arrangement of plants. On the basis of the structure of trunk and fructification he divided plants into fifteen "higher genera". 
 John Ray (1627–1705) was an English naturalist who published important works on plants, animals, and natural theology. The approach he took to the classification of plants in his Historia Plantarum was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system of dichotomous division by which species were classified according to a pre-conceived, either/or type system, and instead classified plants according to similarities and differences that emerged from observation. 
 Both Caesalpino and Ray used traditional plant names and thus, the name of a plant did not reflect its taxonomic position (e.g.,&#160;even though the apple and the peach belonged to different "higher genera" of John Ray's methodus , both retained their traditional names Malus and Malus Persica respectively). A further step was taken by Rivinus and Pitton de Tournefort who made genus a distinct rank within taxonomic hierarchy and introduced the practice of naming the plants according to their genera. 
 Augustus Quirinus Rivinus (1652–1723), in his classification of plants based on the characters of the flower , introduced the category of order (corresponding to the "higher" genera of John Ray and Andrea Caesalpino). He was the first to abolish the ancient division of plants into herbs and trees and insisted that the true method of division should be based on the parts of the fructification alone. Rivinus extensively used dichotomous keys to define both orders and genera. His method of naming plant species resembled that of Joseph Pitton de Tournefort. The names of all plants belonging to the same genus should begin with the same word (generic name). In the genera containing more than one species the first species was named with generic name only, while the second, etc. were named with a combination of the generic name and a modifier ( differentia specifica ). 
 Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1656–1708) introduced an even more sophisticated hierarchy of class, section, genus, and species. He was the first to use consistently the uniformly composed species names that consisted of a generic name and a many-worded diagnostic phrase differentia specifica. Unlike Rivinus, he used differentiae with all species of polytypic genera.

 Carolus Linnaeus 
 
 
 Carolus Linnaeus ' great work, the Systema Naturæ (1st ed. 1735), ran through twelve editions during his lifetime. In this work, nature was divided into three kingdoms: mineral, vegetable and animal. Linnaeus used five ranks: class, order, genus, species, and variety. 
 He abandoned long descriptive names of classes and orders still used by his immediate predecessors (Rivinus and Pitton de Tournefort) and replaced them with single-word names, provided genera with detailed diagnoses ( characteres naturales ), and combined numerous varieties into their species, thus saving botany from the chaos of new forms produced by horticulturalists . 
 Linnaeus is best known for his introduction of the method still used to formulate the scientific name of every species. Before Linnaeus, long many-worded names (composed of a generic name and a differentia specifica ) had been used, but as these names gave a description of the species, they were not fixed. In his Philosophia Botanica (1751) Linnaeus took every effort to improve the composition and reduce the length of the many-worded names by abolishing unnecessary rhetorics, introducing new descriptive terms and defining their meaning with an unprecedented precision. In the late 1740s Linnaeus began to use a parallel system of naming species with nomina trivialia. Nomen triviale , a trivial name, was a single- or two-word epithet placed on the margin of the page next to the many-worded "scientific" name. The only rules Linnaeus applied to them was that the trivial names should be short, unique within a given genus, and that they should not be changed. Linnaeus consistently applied nomina trivialia to the species of plants in Species Plantarum (1st ed. 1753) and to the species of animals in the 10th edition of Systema Naturæ (1758). 
 By consistently using these specific epithets, Linnaeus separated nomenclature from description. Even though the parallel use of nomina trivialia and many-worded descriptive names continued until late in the eighteenth century, it was gradually replaced by the practice of using shorter proper names consisting of the generic name and the trivial name of the species. In the nineteenth century, this new practice was codified in the first Rules and Laws of Nomenclature, and the 1st ed. of Species Plantarum and the 10th ed. of Systema Naturae were chosen as starting points for the Botanical and Zoological Nomenclature respectively. This convention for naming species is referred to as binomial nomenclature . 
 Today, nomenclature is regulated by Nomenclature Codes , which allows names divided into taxonomic ranks .

 Whereas Linnaeus classified for ease of identification, the idea of the Linnaean taxonomy as translating into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal - and Plant Kingdoms was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before the On the Origin of Species was published. Among early works exploring the idea of a transmutation of species was Erasmus Darwin 's 1796 Zoönomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck 's Philosophie Zoologique of 1809. The idea was popularised in the Anglophone world by the speculative, but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation , published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844. [ 9 ] 
 With Darwin's theory, a general acceptance that classification should reflect the Darwinian principle of common descent quickly appeared. Tree of Life representations became popular in scientific works, with known fossil groups incorporated. One of the first modern groups tied to fossil ancestors were birds . Using the then newly discovered fossils of Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis , Thomas Henry Huxley pronounced that they had evolved from dinosaurs, a group formally named by Richard Owen in 1842. [ 10 ] The resulting description, that of dinosaurs "giving rise to" or being "the ancestors of" birds, is the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th century, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups [ 11 ] With the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s, an essentially modern understanding of evolution of the major groups was in place. The evolutionary taxonomy being based on Linnaean taxonomic ranks, the two terms are largely interchangeable in modern use. 
 Since the 1960s a trend called phylogenetic nomenclature (or cladism) has emerged, inspired by the cladistic method. The salient feature is arranging taxa in a hierarchical evolutionary tree , ignoring ranks. If a taxon includes all the descendants of some ancestral form, it is called monophyletic . Groups that have descendant groups removed from them (e.g.,&#160; dinosaurs , with birds as offspring group) are termed paraphyletic , while groups representing more than one branch from the tree of life are called polyphyletic . A formal code of nomenclature, the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature , or PhyloCode for short, is currently under development, intended to deal with names of clades . Linnaean ranks will be optional under the PhyloCode , which is intended to coexist with the current, rank-based codes. 
 [ edit ] Kingdoms and domains 
 Main article: Kingdom (biology) 
 Well before Linnaeus, plants and animals were considered separate Kingdoms . Linnaeus used this as the top rank, dividing the physical world into the plant, animal and mineral kingdoms. As advances in microscopy made classification of microorganisms possible, the number of kingdoms increased, five and six-kingdom systems being the most common. 
 Domains are a relatively new grouping. The three-domain system was first proposed in 1990, but not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of Archaea and Bacteria , previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera ). Consequently, the three domains of life are conceptualized as Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota (comprising the nuclei-bearing eukaryotes). [ 12 ] A small minority of scientists add Archaea as a sixth kingdom, but do not accept the domain method. 
 Thomas Cavalier-Smith , who has published extensively on the classification of protists, has recently proposed that the Neomura , the clade that groups together the Archaea and Eukarya , would have evolved from Bacteria , more precisely from Actinobacteria . His classification of 2004 treats the archaebacteria as part of a subkingdom of the Kingdom Bacteria, i.e.,&#160;he rejects the three-domain system entirely. [ 13 ]

 [ edit ] Authorities (author citation) 
 An "authority" may be placed after a scientific name. The authority is the name of the scientist who first validly published the name. For example, in 1758 Linnaeus gave the Asian elephant the scientific name Elephas maximus , so the name is sometimes written as " Elephas maximus Linnaeus, 1758". The names of authors are frequently abbreviated: the abbreviation L. is universally accepted for Linnaeus, and in botany there is a regulated list of standard abbreviations (see list of botanists by author abbreviation ). The system for assigning authorities differs slightly between botany and zoology . However, it is standard that if a species' name or placement has been changed since the original description, the original authority's name is placed in parentheses. 
 [ edit ] Globally unique identifiers for names 
 There is a movement within the biodiversity informatics community to provide globally unique identifiers in the form of Life Science Identifiers (LSID) for all biological names. This would allow authors to cite names unambiguously in electronic media and reduce the significance of errors in the spelling of names or the abbreviation of authority names. Three large nomenclatural databases (referred to as nomenclators) have already begun this process, these are Index Fungorum , International Plant Names Index (IPNI) and ZooBank . Other databases, that publish taxonomic rather than nomenclatural data, have also started using LSIDs to identify taxa . The key example of this is Catalogue of Life . In the next step in integration, these taxonomic databases will include references to the nomenclatural databases using LSIDs.

				 Witnessing the consolidation of a new field is an infrequent and exciting event. Such was the &#x27;coming of age&#x27; of evolutionary cell biology at a recent conference on the origins of compartmentalized cells, held at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. From the conference program and accompanying discussion, it was apparent that a phylogenetic approach to cell biology is an informative and necessary tool for understanding molecular mechanisms of intracellular membrane organization and traffic, as well as cytoskeleton regulation. In fact, it would be ignorant and wasteful not to incorporate the large amount of comparative data emerging from genomic studies of diverse organisms into analysis of even the most fundamental cellular pathways. As revealed at the conference, we can learn much from the search for the billion-year-old last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). What started as a quest to define how membrane compartmentalization arose in eukaryotic cells has generated an effort to find related pathways in prokaryotic cells, and has inspired studies of variant pathways in eukaryotes distinct from common model organisms. Thus, a notable benefit emerging from this reductionist exercise of defining LECA is the appreciation of diversity. For example, analysis of Rab protein function in Tetrahymena has revealed unique elaborations of their secretory pathway in response to their environment. Such variation shows how secretion can be naturally manipulated, with potential relevance for research or therapeutic development. Of more obvious medical relevance are membrane traffic proteins with restricted species distribution in mammals, including the primate-specific TBC1D3 and syntaxin 10, and CHC22 clathrin, which is present in humans and other vertebrates but not in mice. All three proteins have been shown to function in human cellular pathways that are directly relevant to type 2 diabetes. At the opposite extreme, the identification by domain homology modelling of putative membrane coat proteins in the PVC ( Planctomycetes , Verrucomicrobia and Chlamydiae ) prokaryota genera supports the hypothesis that membrane coats comprising structural units of &#x003B1; -solenoids and &#x003B2;-propellers contributed to primordial membrane compartmentalization. Surprisingly, deep phylogenetic analysis of multiple proteins involved in membrane compartmentalization suggests that LECA was already a sophisticated eukaryote harbouring several membrane trafficking pathways. The emerging analytical approach of combining phylogenetics with structural motif identification has facilitated recognition of novel mammalian coat proteins of ancient origin, with links to neurological disease. Thus, in pursuit of the pure biological (and, indeed, historical) question of how compartmentalized cells arose, much of the acquired information has potential biomedical significance. Further insights are likely to arise as the field continues to address the complex relationship between energetics of cells, and the size, scale and organization of DNA and RNA in a eukaryotic cell. These considerations were discussed in the context of an unresolved issue: the origin of patently eubacterial components (for example, mitochondria and chloroplasts) in the modern eukaryote. This issue continues to pose a challenge for the reconstruction of evolutionary history using molecular-clock-based phylogenetic approaches. A second point from the conference is how cell biological issues come into better focus when viewed through the micro-evolutionary lens of population genetics. Major changes in genomes and proteins can arise by non-selective random genetic drift. Furthermore, selection driven by host&#x02013;pathogen interaction can leave functional traces in cells. Encounters with viruses and bacteria induce signatures of rapidly co-evolving host cellular proteins, wielding a considerable evolutionary influence. Moreover, searching for these pathogen-driven evolutionary signatures to characterize cellular evolution could have practical value for human infection and reveal targets for therapeutic intervention. The conference also provided a forum for immunologists, a community that has long grappled with co-evolution, to contribute to discussions of evolutionary cell biology. Host&#x02013;pathogen interactions shape immune system mechanisms, generating considerable phylogenetic diversity of immune response pathways, as well as rapid evolution of these responses in a species. For example, the receptors on natural killer cells (lymphocytes involved in the innate immune response) have completely different structures in humans and mice, and display major variation between humans and other primates. Population studies, as well as phylogenetics, reveal pathogen-related selective pressures driving receptor (and ligand) diversity. Sophisticated analytical methods for genome comparison, homologue and paralogue identification, and comparative population genetics have emerged from such immunology studies. Evolutionary cell biology can certainly benefit from the application of such methods. In summary, the emergence of evolutionary cell biology as a significant field opens a new window on cell biology that arises from the analysis and appreciation of organismal diversity. In a satisfying example of &#x27;turnabout as fair play&#x27;, this new field will profit from genetic approaches that were developed in immunology, a field that has previously benefited greatly from contributions of basic cell biology. Evolutionary cell biology was inspired by the fundamental biological questions of how and why eukaryotic cells acquired endomembrane systems that enabled their interaction with changing environments and cooperation into multicellular organisms and tissues. However, such studies also have clear significance to human health. Understanding how the elegant adaptive responses of evolution have solved unique biological problems in diverse organisms (including humans) can be applied to manipulating human physiological pathways, as well as to establishing the mechanisms through which eukaryotic cellular complexity arose.

 In biology , an organism is any contiguous living system (such as animal , fungus , micro-organism , or plant ). In at least some form, all types of organisms are capable of response to stimuli , reproduction , growth and development , and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole. 
 An organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of humans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs . The term multicellular (many cells) describes any organism made up of more than one cell. 
 All organisms living on Earth are divided into the eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on the presence or absence of true nuclei in their cells. The prokaryotes represent two separate domains , the Bacteria and Archaea . Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus , and contain additional membrane-bound compartmentalization called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plastids in plants, both generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). [ 1 ]  Fungi , animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms that are eukaryotes. 
 In 2002 Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade , Neomura , which groups together the Archaea and Eukarya . Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria , more specifically from Actinobacteria . [ 2 ] See Branching order of bacterial phyla .

 [ edit ] Etymology 
 The term "organism" ( Greek ὀργανισμός – organismos , from Ancient Greek ὄργανον – organon , "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension" [ 3 ] ) first appeared in the English language in 1701 and took on its current definition by 1834 ( Oxford English Dictionary ). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings. [ 4 ] 
 There has been a great deal of recent controversy about the best way to define the organism [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] and indeed about whether or not such a definition is necessary. [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] Several contributions [ 15 ] are responses to the suggestion that the category of "organism" may well not be adequate in biology. [ 16 ] 
 [ edit ] Semantics 
 The word organism may broadly be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. However, many sources propose definitions that exclude viruses and theoretically possible man-made non-organic life forms. [ 17 ]  Viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction. 
 Chambers Online Reference provides a broad definition: "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction". [ 18 ] 
 In multicellular terms, "organism" usually describes the whole hierarchical assemblage of systems (for example circulatory , digestive , or reproductive ) themselves collections of organs ; these are, in turn, collections of tissues, which are themselves made of cells . In some plants and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , individual cells are totipotent . 
 A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit . 
 [ edit ] Non-cellular life 
 Main article: Non-cellular life 
 Viruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction , growth or metabolism . This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but not of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own and cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds that form them. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction and they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell . In this sense they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not accounted organisms, they do have their own genes and they do evolve by similar mechanisms by which organisms evolve. 
 The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of evolution could be different; however, the ability to evolve would not be affected. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate themselves. [ 19 ] The discovery of viral megagenoms with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong on the tree of life . The presence of these genes suggested that viruses could metabolize in the past. It was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have cellular origin. Most likely, they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts. [ 19 ] 
 Another good argument against placing viruses on the tree of life [ not relevant ] is their polyphyletic origin. [ 19 ] Viruses do not share homologous characteristics neither with cellular organisms, nor with other viruses. Since it is impossible to trace viral evolution back to the last universal ancestor , it is also impossible to place them on the tree of life, which is based on the gene homology.

The hierarchy of biological classification 's eight major taxonomic ranks . Intermediate minor rankings are not shown. 
 
 
 All organisms are classified by the science of alpha taxonomy into either taxa or clades . 
 Taxa are ranked groups of organisms, which run from the general ( domain ) to the specific ( species ). A broad scheme of ranks in hierarchical order is: 
 
 
 Domain 
 Kingdom 
 Phylum 
 Class 
 Order 
 Family 
 Genus 
 Species 
 
 
 To give an example, Homo sapiens is the Latin binomial equating to modern humans. All members of the species sapiens are, at least in theory, genetically able to interbreed. Several species may belong to a genus, but the members of different species within a genus are unable to interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Homo , however, only has one surviving species ( sapiens ), Homo erectus , Homo neanderthalensis , etc. having become extinct thousands of years ago. Several genera belong to the same family and so on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the relevant kingdom ( Animalia , in the case of humans) is placed into one of the three domains depending upon certain genetic and structural characteristics. 
 All living organisms known to science are given classification by this system such that the species within a particular family are more closely related and genetically similar than the species within a particular phylum. 
 Since viruses are not living organisms, their classification is a challenging task. At first, viruses were classified according to their hosts: plant viruses, animal viruses, bacteriophages. Later, they were classified by the disease that they cause. For example, respiratory viruses, enterics. Now, viruses are classified based on the nucleic acid content, capsid symmetry and the presence or absence of the envelope. 
 [ edit ] Chemistry 
 Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life . It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their DNA -based genes. 
 Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of chemical compounds that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles. 
 Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. Autotrophs produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take in organic compounds from the environment. 
 The primary chemical element in these compounds is carbon . The physical properties of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as carbon dioxide ), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ( nucleic acids ), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein). 
 [ edit ] Macromolecules 
 Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids , proteins , carbohydrates and lipids . Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides . The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine ) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons , each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid . Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function. 
 These protein functions have been recognized: 
 
 Enzymes , which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism 
 Structural proteins, such as tubulin , or collagen 
 Regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle 
 Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some hormones and their receptors 
 Defensive proteins, which can include everything from antibodies of the immune system , to toxins (e.g., dendrotoxins of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like canavanine 
 
 A bilayer of phospholipids makes up the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell.Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membraine only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins.In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms. 
 [ edit ] Structure 
 All organisms consist of monomeric units called cells ; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a tissue , and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely epithelium , nervous tissue , muscle tissue , and connective tissue . Several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart , or as a barrier to the environment as the skin ). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system to allow for reproduction , digestion , etc. Many multicell organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life. 
 [ edit ] Cell 
 The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; all vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. 
 There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell, eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes. 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane , which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. 
 All cells share several similar characteristics of: [ 20 ] 
 
 Reproduction by cell division ( binary fission , mitosis or meiosis ). 
 Use of enzymes and other proteins coded by DNA genes and made via messenger RNA intermediates and ribosomes . 
 Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, molecules and releasing by-products . The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from metabolic pathways . 
 Response to external and internal stimuli such as changes in temperature, pH or nutrient levels. 
 Cell contents are contained within a cell surface membrane that contains proteins and a lipid bilayer . 
 
 [ edit ] Life span 
 One of the basic parameters of an organism is its life span . Some organisms live as short as one day, while some plants and fungi can live thousands of years. 
 [ edit ] Evolution 
 See also: Common descent &#160;and Origin of life 
 In biology, the theory of universal common descent proposes that all organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly. 
 Today, there is debate over whether or not all organisms descended from a common ancestor, or a " last universal ancestor " (LUA), also called the "last universal common ancestor" (LUCA), the hypothetical unicellular organism or single cell that gave rise to all life on Earth 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. [ 21 ] The universality of genetic coding suggests common ancestry. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins, although exceptions to the basic twenty amino acids have been found. However, throughout history groupings based on appearance or function of species have sometimes been polyphyletic due to convergent evolution . 
 It was once thought that the genetic code was invariably universal (see: Universal genetic code ), but many variations have been discovered [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes. [ 23 ] Back in the early 1970s, evolutionary biologists thought that a given piece of DNA specified the same protein subunit in every living thing, and that the genetic code was thus universal. This was interpreted as evidence that every organism had inherited its genetic code from a single common ancestor, aka, an LUCA. In 1979, however, exceptions to the code were found in mitochondria , the tiny energy factories inside cells. Researchers studying human mitochondrial genes discovered that they used an alternative code, and many slight variants have been discovered since, [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes, [ 23 ] as well as small variants such as Mycoplasma translating the codon UGA as tryptophan. Biologists subsequently found exceptions in bacteria and in the nuclei of algae and single-cell animals. For example, certain proteins may use alternative initiation (start) codons not normally used by that species. [ 24 ] In certain proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending upon associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA: UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine . Selenocysteine is now viewed as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine is viewed as the 22nd. A detailed description of variations in the genetic code can be found at the NCBI web site .

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including geology and planetary science . These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of time. 
 [ edit ] History of life 
 Main article: Timeline of evolution 
 The chemical evolution from self-catalytic chemical reactions to life (see Origin of life ) is not a part of biological evolution, but it is unclear at which point such increasingly complex sets of reactions became what we would consider, today, to be living organisms. 
 
 
 
  
 Precambrian stromatolites in the Siyeh Formation, Glacier National Park . In 2002, William Schopf of UCLA published a controversial paper in the journal Nature arguing that formations such as this possess 3.5 billion year old fossilized algae microbes. If true, they would be the earliest known life on earth. 
 
 
 Little is known about the earliest developments in life. However, all existing organisms share certain traits, including cellular structure and genetic code . Most scientists interpret this to mean all existing organisms share a common ancestor, which had already developed the most fundamental cellular processes, but there is no scientific consensus on the relationship of the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota) or the origin of life. Attempts to shed light on the earliest history of life generally focus on the behavior of macromolecules , particularly RNA, and the behavior of complex systems . 
 The emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis (around 3 billion years ago) and the subsequent emergence of an oxygen-rich, non-reducing atmosphere can be traced through the formation of banded iron deposits, and later red beds of iron oxides. This was a necessary prerequisite for the development of aerobic cellular respiration , believed to have emerged around 2 billion years ago. 
 In the last billion years, simple multicellular plants and animals began to appear in the oceans. Soon after the emergence of the first animals, the Cambrian explosion (a period of unrivaled and remarkable, but brief, organismal diversity documented in the fossils found at the Burgess Shale ) saw the creation of all the major body plans, or phyla , of modern animals. This event is now believed to have been triggered by the development of the Hox genes . About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonized the land, and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals, leading to the development of today's land ecosystems . 
 The evolutionary process may be exceedingly slow. Fossil evidence indicates that the diversity and complexity of modern life has developed over much of the history of the earth . Geological evidence indicates that the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old . Studies on guppies by David Reznick at the University of California, Riverside, however, have shown that the rate of evolution through natural selection can proceed 10 thousand to 10 million times faster than what is indicated in the fossil record. [ 25 ] Such comparative studies however are invariably biased by disparities in the time scales over which evolutionary change is measured in the laboratory, field experiments, and the fossil record. 
 [ edit ] Horizontal gene transfer 
 Main article: Horizontal gene transfer 
 The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence. 
 
 Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes. [ 26 ] 
 
 Biologist Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes." [ 27 ] 
 [ edit ] Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms) 
 In modern terms, the category of organism cloning refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. However, cloning also has the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Organism cloning is the subject of much ethical debate. (see Bioethics , Ethics of cloning , and Designer baby articles) 
 In 2008 the J. Craig Venter Institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome , Mycoplasma genitalium , by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. "The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments." [ 28 ] Other companies, such as Synthetic Genomics , have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

 In biology , an organism is any contiguous living system (such as animal , fungus , micro-organism , or plant ). In at least some form, all types of organisms are capable of response to stimuli , reproduction , growth and development , and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole. 
 An organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of humans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs . The term multicellular (many cells) describes any organism made up of more than one cell. 
 All organisms living on Earth are divided into the eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on the presence or absence of true nuclei in their cells. The prokaryotes represent two separate domains , the Bacteria and Archaea . Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus , and contain additional membrane-bound compartmentalization called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plastids in plants, both generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). [ 1 ]  Fungi , animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms that are eukaryotes. 
 In 2002 Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade , Neomura , which groups together the Archaea and Eukarya . Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria , more specifically from Actinobacteria . [ 2 ] See Branching order of bacterial phyla .

 [ edit ] Etymology 
 The term "organism" ( Greek ὀργανισμός – organismos , from Ancient Greek ὄργανον – organon , "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension" [ 3 ] ) first appeared in the English language in 1701 and took on its current definition by 1834 ( Oxford English Dictionary ). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings. [ 4 ] 
 There has been a great deal of recent controversy about the best way to define the organism [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] and indeed about whether or not such a definition is necessary. [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] Several contributions [ 15 ] are responses to the suggestion that the category of "organism" may well not be adequate in biology. [ 16 ] 
 [ edit ] Semantics 
 The word organism may broadly be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. However, many sources propose definitions that exclude viruses and theoretically possible man-made non-organic life forms. [ 17 ]  Viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction. 
 Chambers Online Reference provides a broad definition: "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction". [ 18 ] 
 In multicellular terms, "organism" usually describes the whole hierarchical assemblage of systems (for example circulatory , digestive , or reproductive ) themselves collections of organs ; these are, in turn, collections of tissues, which are themselves made of cells . In some plants and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , individual cells are totipotent . 
 A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit . 
 [ edit ] Non-cellular life 
 Main article: Non-cellular life 
 Viruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction , growth or metabolism . This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but not of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own and cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds that form them. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction and they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell . In this sense they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not accounted organisms, they do have their own genes and they do evolve by similar mechanisms by which organisms evolve. 
 The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of evolution could be different; however, the ability to evolve would not be affected. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate themselves. [ 19 ] The discovery of viral megagenoms with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong on the tree of life . The presence of these genes suggested that viruses could metabolize in the past. It was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have cellular origin. Most likely, they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts. [ 19 ] 
 Another good argument against placing viruses on the tree of life [ not relevant ] is their polyphyletic origin. [ 19 ] Viruses do not share homologous characteristics neither with cellular organisms, nor with other viruses. Since it is impossible to trace viral evolution back to the last universal ancestor , it is also impossible to place them on the tree of life, which is based on the gene homology. 
 [ edit ] Organizational terminology 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The hierarchy of biological classification 's eight major taxonomic ranks . Intermediate minor rankings are not shown. 
 
 
 All organisms are classified by the science of alpha taxonomy into either taxa or clades . 
 Taxa are ranked groups of organisms, which run from the general ( domain ) to the specific ( species ). A broad scheme of ranks in hierarchical order is: 
 
 
 Domain 
 Kingdom 
 Phylum 
 Class 
 Order 
 Family 
 Genus 
 Species 
 
 
 To give an example, Homo sapiens is the Latin binomial equating to modern humans. All members of the species sapiens are, at least in theory, genetically able to interbreed. Several species may belong to a genus, but the members of different species within a genus are unable to interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Homo , however, only has one surviving species ( sapiens ), Homo erectus , Homo neanderthalensis , etc. having become extinct thousands of years ago. Several genera belong to the same family and so on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the relevant kingdom ( Animalia , in the case of humans) is placed into one of the three domains depending upon certain genetic and structural characteristics. 
 All living organisms known to science are given classification by this system such that the species within a particular family are more closely related and genetically similar than the species within a particular phylum. 
 Since viruses are not living organisms, their classification is a challenging task. At first, viruses were classified according to their hosts: plant viruses, animal viruses, bacteriophages. Later, they were classified by the disease that they cause. For example, respiratory viruses, enterics. Now, viruses are classified based on the nucleic acid content, capsid symmetry and the presence or absence of the envelope. 
 [ edit ] Chemistry 
 Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life . It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their DNA -based genes. 
 Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of chemical compounds that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles. 
 Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. Autotrophs produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take in organic compounds from the environment. 
 The primary chemical element in these compounds is carbon . The physical properties of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as carbon dioxide ), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ( nucleic acids ), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein). 
 [ edit ] Macromolecules 
 Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids , proteins , carbohydrates and lipids . Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides . The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine ) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons , each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid . Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function. 
 These protein functions have been recognized: 
 
 Enzymes , which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism 
 Structural proteins, such as tubulin , or collagen 
 Regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle 
 Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some hormones and their receptors 
 Defensive proteins, which can include everything from antibodies of the immune system , to toxins (e.g., dendrotoxins of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like canavanine 
 
 A bilayer of phospholipids makes up the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell.Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membraine only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins.In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms. 
 [ edit ] Structure 
 All organisms consist of monomeric units called cells ; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a tissue , and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely epithelium , nervous tissue , muscle tissue , and connective tissue . Several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart , or as a barrier to the environment as the skin ). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system to allow for reproduction , digestion , etc. Many multicell organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life. 
 [ edit ] Cell 
 The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; all vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. 
 There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell, eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes. 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane , which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. 
 All cells share several similar characteristics of: [ 20 ] 
 
 Reproduction by cell division ( binary fission , mitosis or meiosis ). 
 Use of enzymes and other proteins coded by DNA genes and made via messenger RNA intermediates and ribosomes . 
 Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, molecules and releasing by-products . The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from metabolic pathways . 
 Response to external and internal stimuli such as changes in temperature, pH or nutrient levels. 
 Cell contents are contained within a cell surface membrane that contains proteins and a lipid bilayer . 
 
 [ edit ] Life span 
 One of the basic parameters of an organism is its life span . Some organisms live as short as one day, while some plants and fungi can live thousands of years. 
 [ edit ] Evolution 
 See also: Common descent &#160;and Origin of life 
 In biology, the theory of universal common descent proposes that all organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly. 
 Today, there is debate over whether or not all organisms descended from a common ancestor, or a " last universal ancestor " (LUA), also called the "last universal common ancestor" (LUCA), the hypothetical unicellular organism or single cell that gave rise to all life on Earth 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. [ 21 ] The universality of genetic coding suggests common ancestry. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins, although exceptions to the basic twenty amino acids have been found. However, throughout history groupings based on appearance or function of species have sometimes been polyphyletic due to convergent evolution . 
 It was once thought that the genetic code was invariably universal (see: Universal genetic code ), but many variations have been discovered [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes. [ 23 ] Back in the early 1970s, evolutionary biologists thought that a given piece of DNA specified the same protein subunit in every living thing, and that the genetic code was thus universal. This was interpreted as evidence that every organism had inherited its genetic code from a single common ancestor, aka, an LUCA. In 1979, however, exceptions to the code were found in mitochondria , the tiny energy factories inside cells. Researchers studying human mitochondrial genes discovered that they used an alternative code, and many slight variants have been discovered since, [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes, [ 23 ] as well as small variants such as Mycoplasma translating the codon UGA as tryptophan. Biologists subsequently found exceptions in bacteria and in the nuclei of algae and single-cell animals. For example, certain proteins may use alternative initiation (start) codons not normally used by that species. [ 24 ] In certain proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending upon associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA: UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine . Selenocysteine is now viewed as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine is viewed as the 22nd. A detailed description of variations in the genetic code can be found at the NCBI web site .

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including geology and planetary science . These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of time.

 The chemical evolution from self-catalytic chemical reactions to life (see Origin of life ) is not a part of biological evolution, but it is unclear at which point such increasingly complex sets of reactions became what we would consider, today, to be living organisms. 
 
 
 
  
 Precambrian stromatolites in the Siyeh Formation, Glacier National Park . In 2002, William Schopf of UCLA published a controversial paper in the journal Nature arguing that formations such as this possess 3.5 billion year old fossilized algae microbes. If true, they would be the earliest known life on earth. 
 
 
 Little is known about the earliest developments in life. However, all existing organisms share certain traits, including cellular structure and genetic code . Most scientists interpret this to mean all existing organisms share a common ancestor, which had already developed the most fundamental cellular processes, but there is no scientific consensus on the relationship of the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota) or the origin of life. Attempts to shed light on the earliest history of life generally focus on the behavior of macromolecules , particularly RNA, and the behavior of complex systems . 
 The emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis (around 3 billion years ago) and the subsequent emergence of an oxygen-rich, non-reducing atmosphere can be traced through the formation of banded iron deposits, and later red beds of iron oxides. This was a necessary prerequisite for the development of aerobic cellular respiration , believed to have emerged around 2 billion years ago. 
 In the last billion years, simple multicellular plants and animals began to appear in the oceans. Soon after the emergence of the first animals, the Cambrian explosion (a period of unrivaled and remarkable, but brief, organismal diversity documented in the fossils found at the Burgess Shale ) saw the creation of all the major body plans, or phyla , of modern animals. This event is now believed to have been triggered by the development of the Hox genes . About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonized the land, and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals, leading to the development of today's land ecosystems . 
 The evolutionary process may be exceedingly slow. Fossil evidence indicates that the diversity and complexity of modern life has developed over much of the history of the earth . Geological evidence indicates that the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old . Studies on guppies by David Reznick at the University of California, Riverside, however, have shown that the rate of evolution through natural selection can proceed 10 thousand to 10 million times faster than what is indicated in the fossil record. [ 25 ] Such comparative studies however are invariably biased by disparities in the time scales over which evolutionary change is measured in the laboratory, field experiments, and the fossil record. 
 [ edit ] Horizontal gene transfer 
 Main article: Horizontal gene transfer 
 The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence. 
 
 Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes. [ 26 ] 
 
 Biologist Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes." [ 27 ] 
 [ edit ] Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms) 
 In modern terms, the category of organism cloning refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. However, cloning also has the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Organism cloning is the subject of much ethical debate. (see Bioethics , Ethics of cloning , and Designer baby articles) 
 In 2008 the J. Craig Venter Institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome , Mycoplasma genitalium , by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. "The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments." [ 28 ] Other companies, such as Synthetic Genomics , have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

 In biology , an organism is any contiguous living system (such as animal , fungus , micro-organism , or plant ). In at least some form, all types of organisms are capable of response to stimuli , reproduction , growth and development , and maintenance of homeostasis as a stable whole. 
 An organism may be either unicellular (a single cell) or, as in the case of humans, comprise many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs . The term multicellular (many cells) describes any organism made up of more than one cell. 
 All organisms living on Earth are divided into the eukaryotes and prokaryotes based on the presence or absence of true nuclei in their cells. The prokaryotes represent two separate domains , the Bacteria and Archaea . Eukaryotic organisms are characterized by the presence of a membrane-bound cell nucleus , and contain additional membrane-bound compartmentalization called organelles (such as mitochondria in animals and plastids in plants, both generally considered to be derived from endosymbiotic bacteria). [ 1 ]  Fungi , animals and plants are examples of kingdoms of organisms that are eukaryotes. 
 In 2002 Thomas Cavalier-Smith proposed a clade , Neomura , which groups together the Archaea and Eukarya . Neomura is thought to have evolved from Bacteria , more specifically from Actinobacteria . [ 2 ] See Branching order of bacterial phyla .

 [ edit ] Etymology 
 The term "organism" ( Greek ὀργανισμός – organismos , from Ancient Greek ὄργανον – organon , "instrument, implement, tool, organ of sense or apprehension" [ 3 ] ) first appeared in the English language in 1701 and took on its current definition by 1834 ( Oxford English Dictionary ). It is directly related to the term "organization". There is a long tradition of defining organisms as self-organizing beings. [ 4 ] 
 There has been a great deal of recent controversy about the best way to define the organism [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] and indeed about whether or not such a definition is necessary. [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] Several contributions [ 15 ] are responses to the suggestion that the category of "organism" may well not be adequate in biology. [ 16 ] 
 [ edit ] Semantics 
 The word organism may broadly be defined as an assembly of molecules functioning as a more or less stable whole that exhibits the properties of life. However, many sources propose definitions that exclude viruses and theoretically possible man-made non-organic life forms. [ 17 ]  Viruses are dependent on the biochemical machinery of a host cell for reproduction. 
 Chambers Online Reference provides a broad definition: "any living structure, such as a plant, animal, fungus or bacterium, capable of growth and reproduction". [ 18 ] 
 In multicellular terms, "organism" usually describes the whole hierarchical assemblage of systems (for example circulatory , digestive , or reproductive ) themselves collections of organs ; these are, in turn, collections of tissues, which are themselves made of cells . In some plants and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , individual cells are totipotent . 
 A superorganism is an organism consisting of many individuals working together as a single functional or social unit . 
 [ edit ] Non-cellular life 
 Main article: Non-cellular life 
 Viruses are not typically considered to be organisms because they are incapable of autonomous reproduction , growth or metabolism . This controversy is problematic because some cellular organisms are also incapable of independent survival (but not of independent metabolism and procreation) and live as obligatory intracellular parasites. Although viruses have a few enzymes and molecules characteristic of living organisms, they have no metabolism of their own and cannot synthesize and organize the organic compounds that form them. Naturally, this rules out autonomous reproduction and they can only be passively replicated by the machinery of the host cell . In this sense they are similar to inanimate matter. While viruses sustain no independent metabolism, and thus are usually not accounted organisms, they do have their own genes and they do evolve by similar mechanisms by which organisms evolve. 
 The most common argument in support of viruses as living organisms is their ability to undergo evolution and replicate through self-assembly. Some scientists argue that viruses neither evolve, nor self- reproduce. In fact, viruses are evolved by their host cells, meaning that there was co-evolution of viruses and host cells. If host cells did not exist, viral evolution would be impossible. This is not true for cells. If viruses did not exist, the direction of evolution could be different; however, the ability to evolve would not be affected. As for the reproduction, viruses totally rely on hosts' machinery to replicate themselves. [ 19 ] The discovery of viral megagenoms with genes coding for energy metabolism and protein synthesis fueled the debate about whether viruses belong on the tree of life . The presence of these genes suggested that viruses could metabolize in the past. It was found later that the genes coding for energy and protein metabolism have cellular origin. Most likely, they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer from viral hosts. [ 19 ] 
 Another good argument against placing viruses on the tree of life [ not relevant ] is their polyphyletic origin. [ 19 ] Viruses do not share homologous characteristics neither with cellular organisms, nor with other viruses. Since it is impossible to trace viral evolution back to the last universal ancestor , it is also impossible to place them on the tree of life, which is based on the gene homology. 
 [ edit ] Organizational terminology 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The hierarchy of biological classification 's eight major taxonomic ranks . Intermediate minor rankings are not shown. 
 
 
 All organisms are classified by the science of alpha taxonomy into either taxa or clades . 
 Taxa are ranked groups of organisms, which run from the general ( domain ) to the specific ( species ). A broad scheme of ranks in hierarchical order is: 
 
 
 Domain 
 Kingdom 
 Phylum 
 Class 
 Order 
 Family 
 Genus 
 Species 
 
 
 To give an example, Homo sapiens is the Latin binomial equating to modern humans. All members of the species sapiens are, at least in theory, genetically able to interbreed. Several species may belong to a genus, but the members of different species within a genus are unable to interbreed to produce fertile offspring. Homo , however, only has one surviving species ( sapiens ), Homo erectus , Homo neanderthalensis , etc. having become extinct thousands of years ago. Several genera belong to the same family and so on up the hierarchy. Eventually, the relevant kingdom ( Animalia , in the case of humans) is placed into one of the three domains depending upon certain genetic and structural characteristics. 
 All living organisms known to science are given classification by this system such that the species within a particular family are more closely related and genetically similar than the species within a particular phylum. 
 Since viruses are not living organisms, their classification is a challenging task. At first, viruses were classified according to their hosts: plant viruses, animal viruses, bacteriophages. Later, they were classified by the disease that they cause. For example, respiratory viruses, enterics. Now, viruses are classified based on the nucleic acid content, capsid symmetry and the presence or absence of the envelope. 
 [ edit ] Chemistry 
 Organisms are complex chemical systems, organized in ways that promote reproduction and some measure of sustainability or survival. The same laws that govern non-living chemistry govern the chemical processes of life . It is generally the phenomena of entire organisms that determine their fitness to an environment and therefore the survivability of their DNA -based genes. 
 Organisms clearly owe their origin, metabolism, and many other internal functions to chemical phenomena, especially the chemistry of large organic molecules. Organisms are complex systems of chemical compounds that, through interaction and environment, play a wide variety of roles. 
 Organisms are semi-closed chemical systems. Although they are individual units of life (as the definition requires), they are not closed to the environment around them. To operate they constantly take in and release energy. Autotrophs produce usable energy (in the form of organic compounds) using light from the sun or inorganic compounds while heterotrophs take in organic compounds from the environment. 
 The primary chemical element in these compounds is carbon . The physical properties of this element such as its great affinity for bonding with other small atoms, including other carbon atoms, and its small size making it capable of forming multiple bonds, make it ideal as the basis of organic life. It is able to form small three-atom compounds (such as carbon dioxide ), as well as large chains of many thousands of atoms that can store data ( nucleic acids ), hold cells together, and transmit information (protein). 
 [ edit ] Macromolecules 
 Compounds that make up organisms may be divided into macromolecules and other, smaller molecules. The four groups of macromolecule are nucleic acids , proteins , carbohydrates and lipids . Nucleic acids (specifically deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA) store genetic data as a sequence of nucleotides . The particular sequence of the four different types of nucleotides ( adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine ) dictate many characteristics that constitute the organism. The sequence is divided up into codons , each of which is a particular sequence of three nucleotides and corresponds to a particular amino acid . Thus a sequence of DNA codes for a particular protein that, due to the chemical properties of the amino acids it is made from, folds in a particular manner and so performs a particular function. 
 These protein functions have been recognized: 
 
 Enzymes , which catalyze all of the reactions of metabolism 
 Structural proteins, such as tubulin , or collagen 
 Regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors or cyclins that regulate the cell cycle 
 Signaling molecules or their receptors such as some hormones and their receptors 
 Defensive proteins, which can include everything from antibodies of the immune system , to toxins (e.g., dendrotoxins of snakes), to proteins that include unusual amino acids like canavanine 
 
 A bilayer of phospholipids makes up the membrane of cells that constitutes a barrier, containing everything within the cell and preventing compounds from freely passing into, and out of, the cell.Due to the selective permeability of the phospholipid membraine only specific compounds can pass through it. In some multicellular organisms they serve as a storage of energy and mediate communication between cells. Carbohydrates are more easily broken down than lipids and yield more energy to compare to lipids and proteins.In fact, carbohydrates are the number one source of energy for all living organisms. 
 [ edit ] Structure 
 All organisms consist of monomeric units called cells ; some contain a single cell (unicellular) and others contain many units (multicellular). Multicellular organisms are able to specialize cells to perform specific functions. A group of such cells is a tissue , and in animals these occur as four basic types, namely epithelium , nervous tissue , muscle tissue , and connective tissue . Several types of tissue work together in the form of an organ to produce a particular function (such as the pumping of the blood by the heart , or as a barrier to the environment as the skin ). This pattern continues to a higher level with several organs functioning as an organ system to allow for reproduction , digestion , etc. Many multicell organisms consist of several organ systems, which coordinate to allow for life. 
 [ edit ] Cell 
 The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Schleiden and Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells; all cells come from preexisting cells; all vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. 
 There are two types of cells, eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are usually singletons, while eukaryotic cells are usually found in multicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells lack a nuclear membrane so DNA is unbound within the cell, eukaryotic cells have nuclear membranes. 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic, have a membrane , which envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out, and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells possess DNA, the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. 
 All cells share several similar characteristics of: [ 20 ] 
 
 Reproduction by cell division ( binary fission , mitosis or meiosis ). 
 Use of enzymes and other proteins coded by DNA genes and made via messenger RNA intermediates and ribosomes . 
 Metabolism, including taking in raw materials, building cell components, converting energy, molecules and releasing by-products . The functioning of a cell depends upon its ability to extract and use chemical energy stored in organic molecules. This energy is derived from metabolic pathways . 
 Response to external and internal stimuli such as changes in temperature, pH or nutrient levels. 
 Cell contents are contained within a cell surface membrane that contains proteins and a lipid bilayer . 
 
 [ edit ] Life span 
 One of the basic parameters of an organism is its life span . Some organisms live as short as one day, while some plants and fungi can live thousands of years. 
 [ edit ] Evolution 
 See also: Common descent &#160;and Origin of life 
 In biology, the theory of universal common descent proposes that all organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool. Evidence for common descent may be found in traits shared between all living organisms. In Darwin's day, the evidence of shared traits was based solely on visible observation of morphologic similarities, such as the fact that all birds have wings, even those that do not fly. 
 Today, there is debate over whether or not all organisms descended from a common ancestor, or a " last universal ancestor " (LUA), also called the "last universal common ancestor" (LUCA), the hypothetical unicellular organism or single cell that gave rise to all life on Earth 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. [ 21 ] The universality of genetic coding suggests common ancestry. For example, every living cell makes use of nucleic acids as its genetic material, and uses the same twenty amino acids as the building blocks for proteins, although exceptions to the basic twenty amino acids have been found. However, throughout history groupings based on appearance or function of species have sometimes been polyphyletic due to convergent evolution . 
 It was once thought that the genetic code was invariably universal (see: Universal genetic code ), but many variations have been discovered [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes. [ 23 ] Back in the early 1970s, evolutionary biologists thought that a given piece of DNA specified the same protein subunit in every living thing, and that the genetic code was thus universal. This was interpreted as evidence that every organism had inherited its genetic code from a single common ancestor, aka, an LUCA. In 1979, however, exceptions to the code were found in mitochondria , the tiny energy factories inside cells. Researchers studying human mitochondrial genes discovered that they used an alternative code, and many slight variants have been discovered since, [ 22 ] including various alternative mitochondrial codes, [ 23 ] as well as small variants such as Mycoplasma translating the codon UGA as tryptophan. Biologists subsequently found exceptions in bacteria and in the nuclei of algae and single-cell animals. For example, certain proteins may use alternative initiation (start) codons not normally used by that species. [ 24 ] In certain proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending upon associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA: UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine . Selenocysteine is now viewed as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine is viewed as the 22nd. A detailed description of variations in the genetic code can be found at the NCBI web site .

Information about the early development of life includes input from many different fields, including geology and planetary science . These sciences provide information about the history of the Earth and the changes produced by life. However, a great deal of information about the early Earth has been destroyed by geological processes over the course of time. 
 [ edit ] History of life 
 Main article: Timeline of evolution 
 The chemical evolution from self-catalytic chemical reactions to life (see Origin of life ) is not a part of biological evolution, but it is unclear at which point such increasingly complex sets of reactions became what we would consider, today, to be living organisms. 
 
 
 
  
 Precambrian stromatolites in the Siyeh Formation, Glacier National Park . In 2002, William Schopf of UCLA published a controversial paper in the journal Nature arguing that formations such as this possess 3.5 billion year old fossilized algae microbes. If true, they would be the earliest known life on earth. 
 
 
 Little is known about the earliest developments in life. However, all existing organisms share certain traits, including cellular structure and genetic code . Most scientists interpret this to mean all existing organisms share a common ancestor, which had already developed the most fundamental cellular processes, but there is no scientific consensus on the relationship of the three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria, Eukaryota) or the origin of life. Attempts to shed light on the earliest history of life generally focus on the behavior of macromolecules , particularly RNA, and the behavior of complex systems . 
 The emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis (around 3 billion years ago) and the subsequent emergence of an oxygen-rich, non-reducing atmosphere can be traced through the formation of banded iron deposits, and later red beds of iron oxides. This was a necessary prerequisite for the development of aerobic cellular respiration , believed to have emerged around 2 billion years ago. 
 In the last billion years, simple multicellular plants and animals began to appear in the oceans. Soon after the emergence of the first animals, the Cambrian explosion (a period of unrivaled and remarkable, but brief, organismal diversity documented in the fossils found at the Burgess Shale ) saw the creation of all the major body plans, or phyla , of modern animals. This event is now believed to have been triggered by the development of the Hox genes . About 500 million years ago, plants and fungi colonized the land, and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals, leading to the development of today's land ecosystems . 
 The evolutionary process may be exceedingly slow. Fossil evidence indicates that the diversity and complexity of modern life has developed over much of the history of the earth . Geological evidence indicates that the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old . Studies on guppies by David Reznick at the University of California, Riverside, however, have shown that the rate of evolution through natural selection can proceed 10 thousand to 10 million times faster than what is indicated in the fossil record. [ 25 ] Such comparative studies however are invariably biased by disparities in the time scales over which evolutionary change is measured in the laboratory, field experiments, and the fossil record. 
 [ edit ] Horizontal gene transfer 
 Main article: Horizontal gene transfer 
 The ancestry of living organisms has traditionally been reconstructed from morphology, but is increasingly supplemented with phylogenetics—the reconstruction of phylogenies by the comparison of genetic (DNA) sequence. 
 
 Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic "domains". Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes. [ 26 ] 
 
 Biologist Gogarten suggests "the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research", therefore "biologists (should) use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use (the) metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes." [ 27 ] 
 [ edit ] Future of life (cloning and synthetic organisms) 
 In modern terms, the category of organism cloning refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. However, cloning also has the potential of creating entirely new species of organisms. Organism cloning is the subject of much ethical debate. (see Bioethics , Ethics of cloning , and Designer baby articles) 
 In 2008 the J. Craig Venter Institute assembled a synthetic bacterial genome , Mycoplasma genitalium , by using recombination in yeast of 25 overlapping DNA fragments in a single step. "The use of yeast recombination greatly simplifies the assembly of large DNA molecules from both synthetic and natural fragments." [ 28 ] Other companies, such as Synthetic Genomics , have already been formed to take advantage of the many commercial uses of custom designed genomes.

  The rapid growth of knowledge about the nature and function of biological mechanisms has made physiology a corner-stone of the biological and medical sciences. The Physiology program at San Francisco State University is designed to provide students with a strong background in the basic sciences and an opportunity to obtain either a general overview of the field or to specialize. Emphases in Physiology include the neurosciences, reproductive and endocrine physiology, and comparative and ecological physiology, and aging. Studies at the master's level may include, in addition to the above, emphases in ethology, the neural mechanisms of behavior, and human psychophysiology. 
 Teaching and research facilities include a modern, fully-equipped eight-story building with a variety of laboratories for behavioral, biochemical, electrophysiological, and anatomical studies. Additional fieldwork may be done in association with the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, Sierra Nevada Field Campus, the Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies, the San Francisco Zoo, and Marine World. Research internships are currently being conducted in cooperation with the University of California, San Francisco; Veterans Administration Hospital; and the Pacific Medical Center. 
 The highly competent faculty, all with Ph.D. degrees, have research interests in comparative biochemistry, endocrinology, reproductive physiology, human sexuality, ecological physiology, environmental enrichment and behavior of captive wild animals, population biology and physiology of marine mammals, and neurophysiology, and sensory electrophysiology.

  Model organisms are those that useful data sets have    been already gathered to describe basic biological processes. And    they are more amenable to asking certain questions due to their simplicity    of structure and features (Bolker, 1995). In order to explore the    advantages of using model organisms in classrooms, I will examine    their desirable attributes, why certain organisms have been chosen    as model organisms for teaching, the advantages of using model organisms    in teaching, and examples of model organisms popular in biology instruction. Characteristics of Model Organisms for Research and Instruction A model system is a simpler, idealized system that can be accessible    and easily manipulated (Rosenblueth &amp; Wiener, 1945). Therefore, when    selecting living organisms as models to work with, certain criteria    are used depending upon the experimental purposes. As a result, there    is a wide range of characteristics common to model organisms, including:    1) rapid development with short life cycles, 2) small adult size,    3) ready availability, and 4) tractability (Bolker, 1995). Being small,    growing rapidly and being readily available are crucial in terms of    housing them, given the budget and space limitations of research and    teaching laboratories. Tractability relates to the ease with which    they can be manipulated. For example, C. elegans  is a popular    research organism as it possesses all the characteristics mentioned,    yet shares many essential biological properties with humans. For instance,    researchers who study apoptosis (programmed cell death) use C.    elegans as an experimental organism in the hope of finding treatments    for certain types of human cancers, such as leukemia. By studying    apoptosis in C. elegans , researchers hope to identify genes     that switch-on cell death in cancer cells, thus, using the cell's    own genetic machinery to rid the body of malignant cells. Because    leukemia is the unregulated growth of white blood cells, identifying    genes involved in apoptosis may provide researchers with a tool for    treating the rapid proliferation of cancer cells. Advantages of Using Model Organisms in Teaching Biology Model organisms have long been used in the classroom to help students    learn important concepts in various disciplines. Each discipline has    its own set of organisms which have proven to be most suitable to    use. For example, E. coli and Drosophila have been widely    used as model organisms in introductory biology courses to teach microbiology    and genetics. There are three obvious advantages to using model organisms in teaching    biology. First of all, in a laboratory setting, the model organism's    immediate response to the change of environment will enhance students'    learning and serve to hold their attention and interest. Furthermore,    students not only understand what they see, but also believe it is    real (Manney &amp; Manney, 1992). Secondly, the use of model organisms    involves hands-on activities that provide a unique experience that    could not be obtained with other teaching methods (Rowan, 1981). Thirdly,    by working with model organisms, students are able to explore scientific    methods and concepts themselves. Moreover, they will come to understand    about the investigative nature of the scientific enterprise, including    how conclusions are drawn from data (Manney &amp; Manney, 1992; Mertens,    1983). These three advantages might be obtained by using any living    organism. However, model organisms are well-established experimental    systems possessing certain properties, and are more amenable to classroom    use (Bolker, 1995; Brenner, 1974). Why Have Certain Living Organisms Been Chosen as Model Organisms in Teaching?   In general, scientists have to work with organisms different from    the ones they wish to apply their findings to for several reasons    (Bolker, 1995; Flannery, 1997). Krogh (1929) wrote " … for a large    number of problems there will be some animal of choice or a few such    animals on which it can be most conveniently studied." Model organisms    act as surrogates that enable experiments to be carried out under    a more favorable environment than would be available in the original    system (Rosenblueth &amp; Wiener, 1945). The biological insights gained from using model organisms have helped    to cure human diseases and improve people's understanding of life.    Moreover, by studying organisms unrelated to humans, insight into    scientific concepts can sometimes be more easily achieved. Paul Williams    once mentioned that "Major advances in biology often come when diverse    disciplines focus on model organisms." (Wisconsin Fast Plants (WFP),    2003). One example was the discovery of giant chromosomes in Drosophila's    salivary glands that improved researchers' understanding of genetics. The characteristics of model organisms that have made them useful    in research laboratories also make them well-suited to classrooms    (Manney &amp; Manney, 1992). Compared to general living organisms, model    organisms are well-established experimental systems and are often    ready to be used in classrooms. The available resources, such as experimental    protocols, for these model organisms make the transition of their    use to curricula relatively simple. Thus, many are amenable to be    used as experimental organisms in teaching. Examples of Model Organisms Popular in Classroom Use As discussed above, model organisms do play an important role in    conveying biological concepts. Many model organisms have been used    in the classroom. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , is    the most obvious organism used in teaching. It is often used for students    to learn Mendelian genetics. E. coli , yeast, and Rana pipiens are also popular model organisms in biology education. Within the    past two decades, due to its importance and popular use in research,    C. elegans has begun to take its place in the classroom as    an important model organism. Below, I describe some of the model organisms,    and the reasons that make them popular for classroom use. Escherichia coli Escherichia    coli , a prokaryotic organism without a nuclear membrane , is a    representative living material often used in laboratories and classrooms    (Flannery, 1997). E. coli reproduces rapidly (under optimal    situation 0.5 hr/generation) such that results for a number of experiments    can be quickly obtained. Certain mutants of E. coli have been    defined that cannot express certain proteins at saturation growth,    and, therefore, die. E. coli was also the organism used to    elucidate the regulation of the lac operon in genetics. E.    coli 's ability to take up exogenous genetic material under the    procedure known as DNA -mediated cell transformation has also made    it a popular model for studies using recombinant DNA (Moss, 1991).    Using recombinant DNA techniques, E. coli can be manipulated    in research laboratories and in the classroom to produce any DNA,    RNA or protein of interest. Also, it is easy to manipulate both genetically    and biochemically. Most importantly, it shares fundamental characteristics,    such as DNA and messenger RNA, with all other organisms (Botstein    &amp; Fink, 1988). The value of E. coli in recombinant DNA makes    it a good model organism for students to study the genetic material. Drosophila The    fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , has been the most popular    eukaryotic organism used in classrooms. It has been used in heredity    and biomedical research where the aims are to understand human genetics    and developmental processes. It is also a popular model for teaching    Mendelian genetics. Drosophila is very popular and successful    as a model organism because it has short life cycle of two weeks,    making it possible to study numerous generations in an academic year    (Flannery, 1997; Kramer, 1986; Sofer &amp; Tompkins, 1994). It is easy    to culture and inexpensive to house large numbers (Flannery, 1997;    Jeszenszky, 1997; Kramer, 1986). Its size is amenable for cultivation    in school laboratories. Also, it is large enough that many attributes    can be seen with the naked eye or under low-power magnification (Sofer    &amp; Tompkins, 1994). Moreover, it has a very long history in biological    research (since the early 1900s) and there are many useful tools to    facilitate genetic study. For example, the use of antibodies makes    the scoring of specific cells or cell types possible in Drosophila (Rubin, 1988; Sofer &amp; Tompkins, 1994). Because of the above properties, Drosophila has been used    in research and teaching in a great variety of disciplines, such as    classical and molecular genetics. Some researchers use Drosophila to study how its body plan is controlled by a set of homeotic genes.    The more research is done using Drosophila , the better we understand    it, thus making it an attractive model organism for class use (Flannery,    1997; Rubin, 1988). Wisconsin Fast Plants Wisconsin Fast Plants (WFP), mainly rapid-cycling Brassica    rapa (B. rapa) , were developed by Dr. Paul Williams at the University    of Wisconsin - Madison, using classical selective breeding. The WFP,    as well as Chinese cabbage and radish, belong to the Brassica genus, which is part of the Crucifer as family. The selection of fast    growing Creicifers was desirable to speed-up plant biological research    as traditional breeding of Brassica takes about six months.    WFP has been used in the laboratory and classroom for studying basic    and applied plant biology. For example, WFP can be used to study environmental    science for students to see how pollutants affect living organisms,    plant responses such as phototropic and geotropic responses, cell    biology and other biology issues. The advantages of using WFP is that    under continuous fluorescent light, they have a short life cycle (35    - 40 days). Compared to normal B. rapa , which produces at most    two generations per year, one can harvest about ten generations per    year from WFP. They are small (15 cm high, in a 2 cm2 pot) and can    be housed in high densities and large numbers which make them especially    good for school use. They are low-cost and easy to manage. They possess    a wide variety of easily recognized traits that can be used in genetic    studies. For instance, by crossing plants with light or dark plant    colors, students can experiment on simple Mendelian genetics (WFP,    2003). Caenorhabditis elegans In    the last two decades, a nematode , Caenorhabditis elegans , has    captured the hearts of developmental biologists and geneticists hoping    to solve the enigma of cell development and related biological problems,    such as aging. In addition, educators have begun to use it in classrooms    to illustrate central biological concepts, such as cell division (see    " A Survey of Currently    Used C. elegans Curricula "). Its popularity as a model    organism is because it is transparent, thus cells of interest can    be observed using a dissecting microscope. It is small (about 1- 1.5    mm) and easy to cultivate, which makes it possible to house large    numbers of C. elegans . It has a short life cycle (3 days),    which makes the production of numerous generations possible. It can    be crossed at will. Male and hermaphrodites are the two sexes. Hermaphrodites    can self fertilize or mate with males to produce offspring. Thus,    cross or self-fertilization can be manipulated as desired. There are    numerous tools available to study C. elegans , including different    types of antibodies and advanced microscopes. Its genome has been    completely sequenced. This is quite attractive and useful in genetic    studies allowing researchers to pick a gene of interest to study (Donald,    1997; Wood, 1988).   In sum, as discussed, some organisms are easy and amenable for use    in the laboratory and the classroom to enhance our understanding of    human biology. They are called "model organisms". A model organism    is one that possesses the virtues of tractability and accessibility    that can be used in experimental manipulation both in school and research. References Bolker, J. A. (1995).

																 The First Cell arose in the previously pre-biotic world with the coming together of several entities that gave a single vesicle the unique chance to carry out three essential and quite different life processes. These were: (a) to copy informational macromolecules, (b) to carry out specific catalytic functions, and (c) to couple energy from the environment into usable chemical forms. These would foster subsequent cellular evolution and metabolism. Each of these three essential processes probably originated and was lost many times prior to The First Cell, but only when these three occurred together was life jump-started 
 and Darwinian evolution of organisms began. (Koch and Silver, 2005) [ 1 ]

 "The evolution of modern cells is arguably the most challenging and important problem the field of Biology has ever faced. In Darwin's day the problem could hardly be imagined. For much of the 20th century it was intractable. In any case, the problem lay buried in the catch-all rubric "origin of life"---where, because it is a biological not a (bio)chemical problem, it was effectively ignored. Scientific interest in cellular evolution started to pick up once the universal phylogenetic tree, the framework within which the problem had to be addressed, was determined . But it was not until microbial genomics arrived on the scene that biologists could actually do much about the problem of cellular evolution." ( Carl Woese , 2002) [ 2 ]

 [ edit ] The first cells 
 The origin of cells was the most important step in the evolution of life as we know it. The birth of the cell marked the passage from pre-biotic chemistry to partitioned units resembling modern cells. The final transition to living entities that fulfill all the definitions of modern cells depended on the ability to evolve effectively by natural selection. This transition has been called the Darwinian transition . 
 If life is viewed from the point of view of replicator molecules, cells satisfy two fundamental conditions: protection from the outside environment and confinement of biochemical activity. The former condition is needed to keep complex molecules stable in a varying and sometimes aggressive environment; the latter is fundamental for the evolution of biological complexity . If freely floating molecules that code for enzymes are not enclosed in cells, the enzymes will automatically benefit the neighbouring replicator molecules. The consequences of diffusion in non-partitioned life forms might be viewed as " parasitism by default." Therefore the selection pressure on replicator molecules will be lower, as the 'lucky' molecule that produces the better enzyme has no definitive advantage over its close neighbors. If the molecule is enclosed in a cell membrane, then the enzymes coded will be available only to the replicator molecule itself. That molecule will uniquely benefit from the enzymes it codes for; giving it a better chance to multiply. 
 How did partitioning begin? Biochemically, cell-like spheroids formed by proteinoids are observed by heating amino acids with phosphoric acid as a catalyst. They bear much of the basic features provided by cell membranes. Proteinoid-based protocells enclosing RNA molecules could (but not necessarily should) have been the first cellular life forms on Earth. 
 Another theory holds that the turbulent shores of the ancient coastal waters may have served as a mammoth laboratory, aiding in the countless experiments necessary to bring about the first cell. Waves breaking on the shore create a delicate foam composed of bubbles. Winds sweeping across the ocean have a tendency to drive things to shore, much like driftwood collecting on the beach. It is possible that organic molecules were concentrated on the shorelines in much the same way. Shallow coastal waters also tend to be warmer, further concentrating the molecules through evaporation . While bubbles made mostly of water tend to burst quickly, oily bubbles happen to be much more stable, lending more time to the particular bubble to perform these crucial experiments. The phospholipid is a good example of a common oily compound prevalent in the prebiotic seas. 
 Phospholipids can be visualized in one's mind as a hydrophilic head on one end, and a hydrophobic tail on the other. These molecules possess an important characteristic for the construction of cell membranes; they are able to link together to form a bilayer membrane. A lipid monolayer bubble can only contain oil, and is therefore not conducive to harbouring water-soluble organic molecules. On the other hand, a lipid bilayer bubble [1] can contain water, and was a likely precursor to the modern cell membrane. If a protein came along that increased the integrity of its parent bubble, then that bubble had an advantage, and was placed at the top of the natural selection waiting list. Primitive reproduction can be envisioned when the bubbles burst, releasing the results of the experiment into the surrounding medium. Once enough of the 'right stuff' was released into the medium, the development of the first prokaryotes , eukaryotes , and multi-cellular organisms could be achieved. [ 3 ] 
 [ edit ] Community metabolism 
 The common ancestor of the now existing cellular lineages (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea) may well have been a community of organisms that readily exchanged components and genes. It would have contained: 
 
 Autotrophs that produced organic compounds from CO2 either photosynthetically or by inorganic chemical reactions; 
 Heterotrophs that obtained organics by leakage from other organisms 
 Saprotrophs that absorbed nutrients from decaying organisms 
 Phagotrophs that were sufficiently complex to envelop and digest particulate nutrients including other organisms. 
 
 The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. It appears that DNA-bearing organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts are remnants of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing bacteria and cyanobacteria , respectively, where at least part of the rest of the cell may have been derived from an ancestral archaean prokaryote cell. This concept is often termed the endosymbiotic theory but is perhaps better considered as an hypothesis . There is still debate about whether organelles like the hydrogenosome predated the origin of mitochondria , or vice versa : see the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. 
 How the current lineages of microbes evolved from this postulated community is currently unsolved but subject to intense research by biologists, stimulated by the great flow of new discoveries emerging from genome science . [ 4 ] 
 [ edit ] Genetic code and the RNA world 
 Much modern evidence supports the hypothesis that early cellular evolution occurred in a biological realm radically distinct from modern biology. It is thought that in this ancient realm, the current genetic role of DNA was largely filled by RNA, and catalysis also was largely mediated by RNA (that is, by ribozyme counterparts of enzymes). This remarkable concept is known as the RNA world hypothesis . 
 According to this hypothesis, the ancient RNA world transitioned into the modern cellular world via the evolution of forms of protein synthesis akin to modern ribosomal protein synthesis, followed by replacement of many cellular ribozyme catalysts by protein based enzyme catalysts. Proteins are much more flexible in catalysis than RNA due to the existence of diverse amino acid side chains with distinct chemical characteristics. The RNA record in existing cells appears to preserve some 'molecular fossils' from this RNA world. These RNA fossils include the ribosome itself (in which RNA catalyses peptide-bond formation), the modern ribozyme catalyst RNase P , and tRNAs. [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] 
 The universal Genetic code may indeed preserve some evidence for this ancient world. For instance, recent studies of transfer RNAs, the enzymes that charge them with amino acids (the first step in protein synthesis) and the way these components recognise and exploit the genetic code, have been used to suggest that of the universal genetic code emerged before the evolution of the modern amino acid activation method for protein synthesis. [ 5 ]  [ 6 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ] 
 [ edit ] Canonical patterns 
 Despite the fact that the evolutionary origins of the major lineages of modern cells are currently hotly disputed, the primary distinctions between the three major lineages of cellular life (called domains) are clear cut and firmly established. 
 In each of these three domains, protein synthesis machinery, DNA replication, and transcription of RNA from DNA all display distinctive features. There are three versions of ribosomal RNAs, and generally three versions of each ribosomal protein, one for each domain of life. These three versions of the protein synthesis apparatus are called the canonical patterns , and it is the existence of these canonical patterns provide the basis for a definition of the three Domains - Bacteria , Archaea , and Eukarya, (alternatively called Eukaryota) - of currently existing cells. [ 12 ] 
 [ edit ] Using genomics to infer early lines of evolution 
 Instead of relying a single gene such as the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene to reconstruct early evolution, or a few genes, scientific effort has shifted to exploiting the comprehensive information from the many complete genome sequences of organisms that are now available. [ 13 ] 
 From such studies, it is now clear that evolututionary trees based only on SSU rRNA alone do not capture the events of early eukaryote evolution accurately, and the progenitors of the first nucleated cells are still uncertain. For instance, careful analysis of the complete genome of the eukaryote yeast shows that many of its genes are more closely related to bacterial genes than they are to archaea, and it is now clear that archaea were not the simple progenitors of the eukaryotes, in stark contradiction to the earlier findings based on SSU rRNA and limited samples of other genes. [ 14 ] 
 One imaginative but disputed hypothesis getting some support from recent computer-assisted studies of complete genome DNA sequences is that the first nucleated cell arose from two distinctly different ancient prokaryotic (non-nucleated) species that had formed a symbiotic relationship with one another to carry out different aspects of metabolism. One partner of this postulated symbiosis is proposed to be a true bacterial cell, and the other an archaean cell. It is postulated that this symbiotic partnership progressed via the cellular fusion of the partners to generate a chimeric or hybrid cell with a membrane bound internal structure that was the forerunner of the nucleus. The next stage in this scheme was transfer of both partner genomes into the nucleus and their fusion with one another. Several variations of this hypothesis for the origin of nucleated cells have been suggested. [ 15 ] 
 But some biologists dispute this conception [ 4 ] and argue for the need for a shift in conceptual framework if this problem is to be solved. They re-iterate the community metabolism theme, the idea that early living communities would comprise many different entities to extant cells, and would have shared their genetic material more extensively than current microbes.

 What is Evolution? 

Biological evolution is defined as any genetic change in a population that is inherited over several generations. These changes may be small or large, noticeable or not so noticeable. 

In order for an event to be considered an instance of evolution, changes have to occur on the genetic level of a population and be passed on from one generation to the next.  

This means that the genes, or more specifically, the alleles in the population change and are passed on. These changes are noticed in the phenotypes 
(expressed physical traits that can be seen) of the population. 

A change on the genetic level of a population is defined as a small-scale change and is called microevolution. 

Biological evolution also includes the idea that all of life is connected and can be traced back to one common ancestor. This is called macroevolution. 

 What is not Evolution? 

Biological evolution is not defined as simply change over time. 

Many organisms experience changes over time, such as weight loss or gain. These changes are not considered instances of evolution because they are not genetic changes that can be passed on to the next generation.


 Is Evolution a Theory? 


Evolution is a scientific theory that was proposed by Charles Darwin. A scientific theory gives explanations and predictions for naturally occurring phenomena based on observations and experimentations. This type of theory attempts to explain how events seen in the natural world work. 

The definition of a scientific theory differs from the common meaning of theory, which is defined as a guess or a supposition about a particular process. In contrast, a good scientific theory must be testable, falsifiable, and substantiated by factual evidence. 

When it comes to a scientific theory, there is no absolute proof. It's more a case of confirming the reasonability of accepting a theory as a viable explanation for a particular event.


 What is Natural Selection? 

Natural selection is the process by which biological evolutionary changes take place. Natural selection acts on populations and not individuals. It is based on the following concepts: 

 Individuals in a population have different traits which can be inherited. 

 These individuals produce more young than the environment can support. 

 The individuals in a population that are best suited to their environment will leave more offspring, resulting in a change in the genetic makeup of a population. 


The genetic variations that arise in a population happen by chance, but the process of natural selection does not. Natural selection is the result of the interactions between genetic variations in a population and the environment. 

The environment determines which variations are more favorable. Individuals that possess traits that are better suited to their environment will survive to produce more offspring than other individuals. More favorable traits are thereby passed on to the population as a whole.

 How Does Genetic Variation Occur in a Population? 


Genetic variation occurs through sexual reproduction . Due to the fact that environments are unstable, populations that are genetically variable will be able to adapt to changing situations better than those that do not contain genetic variations. 

Sexual reproduction allows for genetic variations to occur through genetic recombination . 

Recombination occurs during meiosis and provides a way for producing new combinations of alleles on a single chromosome. Independent assortment during meiosis allows for an indefinite number of combinations of genes. ( Example of recombination ) 


Sexual reproduction makes it possible to assemble favorable gene combinations in a population or to remove unfavorable gene combinations from a population. Populations with more favorable genetic combinations will survive in their environment and reproduce more offspring than those with less favorable genetic combinations.


 Biological Evolution Versus Creation 

The theory of evolution has caused controversy from the time of its introduction until today. The controversy stems from the perception that biological evolution is at odds with religion concerning the need for a divine creator. Evolutionists contend that evolution does not address the issue of whether or not God exists, but attempts to explain how natural processes work. 

In doing so however, there is no escaping the fact that evolution contradicts certain aspects of some religious beliefs. For example, the evolutionary account for the existence of life and the biblical account of creation are quite different. 

Evolution suggests that all life is connected and can be traced back to one common ancestor. A literal interpretation of biblical creation suggests that life was created by an all powerful, supernatural being (God). 

Still others have tried to merge these two concepts by contending that evolution does not exclude the possibility of the existence of God, but merely explains the process by which God created life. This view however, still contradicts a literal interpretation of creation as presented in the bible. 

In paring down the issue, a major bone of contention between the two views is the concept of macroevolution. For the most part, evolutionists and creationists agree that microevolution does occur and is visible in nature. 

Macroevolution however, refers to the process of evolution that takes place on the level of species, in which one species evolves from another species. This is in stark contrast to the biblical view that God was personally involved in the formation and creation of living organisms. 

For now, the evolution/creation debate continues on and it appears that the differences between these two views are not likely to be settled any time soon.

   Welcome 
   
    Remarkably, although mature fields of cell biology, molecular evolution, genome evolution, and even developmental evolution are now established, there is no recognizable field of evolutionary cell biology. This glaring gap, which might be regarded as the last frontier of evolutionary biology, is a signal opportunity for both cell biologists and evolutionary biologists. 
 
 To identify and address the major gaps in knowledge about the evolution of cell biological systems, we are organizing an NSF-sponsored workshop&#160; (Award MCB-1228570) &#160;to bring together a small group of interactive scientists from a range of backgrounds to consider several fundamental issues. 
 
 Supposing that there is agreement that the time is ripe for the development of such a field, what are the key questions that need to be answered, how should these be prioritized, and which are most accessible with current technologies? 
 What are the major needs of the field from both an educational and research perspective? 
 What would it take to move the field from being simply another arm of comparative biology to one with a more experimental basis? 
 What programs or resources would be required to make a timely and significant impact on moving this emerging area of research forward?

 Taxonomy is a hierarchical system for classifying and identifying organisms. This system was developed by Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century. 

 Binomial Nomenclature 
 Linnaeus's taxonomy system has two main features that contribute to its ease of use in naming and grouping organisms. The first is the use of binomial nomenclature. This means that an organism's scientific name is comprised of a combination of two terms. These terms are the genus name and the species or epithet. Both of these terms are italicized and the genus name is also capitalized. 

 For example, the scientific name for humans is Homo sapiens . The genus name is Homo and the species is sapiens . These terms are unique and no other species can have this same name. 

 Classification Categories 

The second feature of Linnaeus's taxonomy system that simplifies organism classification is the ordering of species into broad categories. There are seven major categories: Kingdom , Phylum , Class , Order , Family , Genus , and Species . 

 A good aid for remembering these categories is the mnemonic device: K eep P lates C lean O r F amily G ets S ick. 

Some of these categories can be further divided into intermediate categories such as subphyla, suborders, superfamilies, and superclasses. An example of this taxonomy scheme is:

 


 
 Kingdom 

 Phylum 

 Subphylum 
 Superclass 

 Class 

 Subclass 
Superorder 

 Order 

 Suborder 
 Superfamily 

 Family 

 Subfamily
 

 Genus 

 Subgenus
 

 Species 

 Subspecies 
 

 

 

Below is a list of organisms and their classification in this taxonomy system using the major categories. Notice how closely related dogs and wolves are. They are similar in every aspect except species name.

 A digital organism is a self-replicating computer program that mutates and evolves . Digital organisms are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian evolution , and to test or verify specific hypotheses or mathematical models of evolution. The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of artificial life .

 [ edit ] History 
 Digital organisms can be traced back to the game Darwin , in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from executing . [ 1 ] A similar implementation that followed this was the game Core War . In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning strategies was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all computational resources . Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated "memory" in which the game took place. This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), "enslaved processes" (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves. 
 Steen Rasmussen at Los Alamos National Laboratory took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the programming language in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program. 
 The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was Tom Ray with his Tierra system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way. 
 Later, Chris Adami , Titus Brown, and Charles Ofria started developing their Avida system, which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same address space and could potentially overwrite or otherwise interfere with each other. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists. Evolutionary biologist Richard Lenski of Michigan State University has used Avida extensively in his work. Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA). 
 In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called Amoeba that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition.

   Molecular Biology &amp; Physiology Research 
		 Faculty in Animal Sciences are conducting research into the cellular, molecular, and physiological control of reproduction, lactation, immune function, and growth. The long-term goal of this research is to develop strategies for manipulating these systems to improve the efficiency of animal production. Every level of animal function is studied from the individual gene to herds and flocks of animals. 
   Research is funded by a wide range of sources including the USDA, livestock industries, and pharmaceutical companies. Departmental facilities for physiology and molecular biology research include well-equipped laboratories, surgical facilities, and facilities for housing all common domestic animal species. Key university-wide resources that are often utilized are the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research and the McKnight Brain Institute . Central to the research mission of the physiology and molecular biology program has been graduate education. Assistantships for qualified students are often available. 
   Research on reproductive physiology research is conducted within the department and cooperatively with other departments in the D. H. Barron Reproductive and Perinatal Biology Research Program . These departments include Animal Sciences in IFAS, Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, and Physiology and Functional Genomics in the College of Medicine, and Large Animal Clinical Sciences and Pathobiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine. The diversity of this program permits graduate students to be exposed to a cross section of a number of reproductive areas. These areas involve ovulation control, uterine function, placental-fetal growth, embryo physiology and micromanipulation, cloning, and lactation. Species studied include cows, sheep, pigs, horses, rats, and mice. 
    Also offered within the Animal Sciences graduate program is the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Graduate Concentration in Animal Molecular and Cell Biology AMCB . It is designed to provide graduate students an understanding of principles of molecular and cell biology and their applications to animal health and production in preparation for careers in research and teaching. This philosophy is expressed and achieved through a multidisciplinary faculty whose teaching and research orientations are towards elucidation of biological mechanisms of growth and development, reproduction, animal diseases and control of gene expression. Seven faculty in Animal Sciences are members of this group and many students contribute to its activities. 
   For detailed information on specific areas of research in the physiology and molecular biology areas, visit individual faculty Web sites via the Animal Sciences directory , as well as Web sites maintained by the D. H. Barron Reproductive and Perinatal Biology Research Program and Interdisciplinary Graduate Concentration in Animal Molecular and Cell Biology .

 Physiology ( pron.: /  ˌ  f  ɪ  z  i  ˈ  ɒ  l  ə  dʒ  i  / ; from Ancient Greek φύσις (physis) , meaning "nature, origin", and –λογία (–logia) , meaning "study of") is the scientific study of function in living systems. [ 1 ] This includes how organisms, organ systems, organs , cells , and bio-molecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. The highest honor awarded in physiology is the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , awarded since 1901 by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .

 [ edit ] History 
 The study of human physiology dates back to at least 420&#160; BC and the time of Hippocrates ,also known as the father of medicine. [ 2 ] The critical thinking of Aristotle and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in Ancient Greece , while Claudius Galenus (c. 126–199&#160;AD), known as Galen , was the first to use experiments to probe the function of the body. Galen was the founder of experimental physiology. [ 3 ] 
 Jean Fernel , a French physician, introduced the term "physiology" in 1525. 
 In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the Cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann . It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. Claude Bernard 's (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of milieu interieur (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as " homeostasis " by American physiologist Walter Cannon (1871–1945). [ clarification needed ] 
 In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of comparative physiology and ecophysiology . [ 4 ] Major figures in these fields include Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew . Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline. [ 5 ] 
 The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical. 
 The endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals. 
 [ edit ] Human physiology 
 Main article: Human physiology 
 Human physiology is the science of the mechanical, physical, and biochemical functions of humans, their organs, and the cells of which they are composed. The principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems. Much of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation. Physiology is closely related to anatomy ; anatomy is the study of form, and physiology is the study of function. Due to the frequent connection between form and function, physiology and anatomy are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.

 The evolution of biological complexity is one important outcome of the process of evolution . Evolution has produced some remarkably complex organisms - although the actual level of complexity is very hard to define or measure accurately in biology, with properties such as gene content, the number of cell types or morphology all being used to assess an organism's complexity. [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] This observation that complex organisms can be produced from simpler ones has led to the common misperception of evolution being progressive and having a direction that leads towards what are viewed as "higher organisms". [ 3 ] 
 Nowadays, this idea of "progression" in evolution is regarded as misleading, with natural selection having no intrinsic direction and organisms selected for either increased or decreased complexity in response to local environmental conditions. [ 4 ] Although there has been an increase in the maximum level of complexity over the history of life , there has always been a large majority of small and simple organisms and the most common level of complexity (the mode ) appears to have remained relatively constant.

 [ edit ] Selection for simplicity and complexity 
 Organisms that reproduce more quickly and plentifully than their competitors have an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as Plasmodium - the parasite responsible for malaria - and mycoplasma ; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host. [ 5 ] 
 A lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment. Loss of this trait need not necessarily confer a selective advantage, but may be lost due to the accumulation of mutations if its loss does not confer an immediate selective disadvantage. [ 6 ] For example, a parasitic organism may dispense with the synthetic pathway of a metabolite where it can readily scavenge that metabolite from its host. Discarding this synthesis may not necessarily allow the parasite to conserve significant energy or resources and grow faster, but the loss may be fixed in the population through mutation accumulation if no disadvantage is incurred by loss of that pathway. Mutations causing loss of a complex trait occur more often than mutations causing gain of a complex trait. 
 With selection, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens, [ 7 ] with each side developing ever more sophisticated adaptations, such as the immune system and the many techniques pathogens have developed to evade it. For example, the parasite Trypanosoma brucei , which causes sleeping sickness , has evolved so many copies of its major surface antigen that about 10% of its genome is devoted to different versions of this one gene. This tremendous complexity allows the parasite to constantly change its surface and thus evade the immune system through antigenic variation . [ 8 ] 
 More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the co-evolution between an organism and the ecosystem of predators , prey and parasites to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an on-going evolutionary arms race [ 7 ] towards more complexity. [ 9 ] This trend may be reinforced by the fact that ecosystems themselves tend to become more complex over time, as species diversity increases, together with the linkages or dependencies between species. 
 [ edit ] Types of trends in complexity 
 
 
 
  
Passive versus active trends in the evolution of complexity. Organisms at the beginning of the processes are colored red. Numbers of organisms are shown by the height of the bars, with the graphs moving up in a time series. 
 
 
 If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity, then we would expect to see an increase over time in the most common value (the mode) of complexity among organisms, as shown to the right. [ 10 ] Indeed, some computer models have suggested that the generation of complex organisms is an inescapable feature of evolution. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] This is sometimes referred to as evolutionary self-organization . Self-organization is the spontaneous internal organization of a system. This process is accompanied by an increase in systemic complexity, resulting in an emergent property that is distinctly different from any of the constituent parts. 
 However, the idea of increasing production of complexity in evolution can also be explained through a passive process. [ 10 ] As shown on the right, this involves an increase in variance but the mode does not change. The trend towards higher complexity over time exists, but also involves increasingly smaller portions of biological life. 
 In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the right-hand tail of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model predicts that the majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes , which is supported by estimates of 10 6 to 10 9 extant prokaryotes [ 13 ] compared to diversity estimates of 10 6 to 3·10 6 for eukaryotes. [ 14 ]  [ 15 ] Consequently, in this view, microscopic life dominates Earth, and large organisms only appear more diverse due to sampling bias . 
 [ edit ] History 
 In the 19th century, some scientists such as Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Ray Lankester believed that all Nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution. This belief may reflect then-current ideas of Hegel and Herbert Spencer that all creation was gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state. 
 According to this view, the evolution of parasites from an independent organism to another parasite was seen as " devolution " or "degeneration", and contrary to Nature. This view has sometimes been used metaphorically by social theorists and propagandists to decry a class of people as "degenerate parasites". Today, "devolution" is regarded as nonsense; rather, lineages will become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms have a selective advantage. [ 16 ]

 Info 
   
  
         
 
  
   
    Welcome to the website for the new Department of Cell Biology &amp; Physiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. 
 The department was formed in July 2012 through the merger of the Department of Cell &amp; Developmental Biology and the Department of Cell &amp; Molecular Physiology. The new department brings together two strong traditions of excellence in basic science and translational research, and in pre- and post-doctoral training, including undergraduate, graduate and medical education. 
 The department currently houses two PhD programs: the Program in Cell &amp; Molecular Physiology and the Program in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology . In addition, a number of members of the department also train PhD students through the Neurobiology Curriculum and the Genetics and Molecular Biology Curriculum.

  Research in the Biological Sciences (RIBS) is a four-week intensive training program designed to expose students to a broad range of molecular, microbiological, and cell biological techniques currently used in research laboratories. Students are immersed in the research experience, giving them a taste of &quot;life at the bench&quot;. 
 
 Using a project-based approach, the course progresses from a survey of basic lab techniques to the application of current techniques in cell and molecular biology. Most of a typical RIBS day is spent in lab. We do not have a formal lecture schedule. Instead, lectures will be presented when needed to provide background and to introduce new concepts. Since communication skills are important in science, students will keep lab notebooks and they will make several group presentations. Notebooks are graded weekly to give the students feedback throughout the course. 
 
 During the first two weeks of the course, students will learn basic lab techniques applicable in many research labs. For example, students will learn how to clone genes, PCR amplify their own DNA, and analyze DNA sequences. In addition, students will learn the basic operation of several types of microscopes, and will learn cell culture and fluorescence staining techniques. Lectures during this period will focus mostly on basic molecular biology - what is the structure of a gene, how are genes regulated, how can you study genes in the lab. We will also read original research articles, learning not just the science but also how scientists present results in written and oral formats. 
 
 By the end of the second week, students will begin work on &quot;independent&quot; projects. During this phase of the course, students perform experiments mostly of their own design. Students generally base their projects on a suggested lists of experiments but the students are given considerable latitude and, after doing a little research the, often come up with exciting project ideas. The course ends with a research forum in which the students present the results of their projects. 
 
 Successful completion of the course will give participants the experience and confidence to work in a research laboratory. On a space available basis, several students will be invited back the following year to work in the lab of a University of Chicago research scientist. 
 
 The application deadline is May 1 (April 15 for international students). Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. This program usually fills several weeks before the deadline. Please submit your complete application as soon as possible. 
 
 Frequently Asked Questions 
 How do I apply?  Applications are available at the University of Chicago summer session website . While you&#39;re there, feel free to view their RIBS website as well! 
 Who are the instructors? 
 Dr. Christopher Schonbaum is a senior lecturer in the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division at the University of Chicago, where he lectures and teaches labs in cell biology, genetics, and developmental biology. He has research experience in the development and molecular genetics of Drosophila (fruit fly) and C. elegans (nematode). 
 
 Dr. Rosemary Zaragoza teaches Pharmacology Perspectives, which covers molecular, cellular and organ basics in biology and incorporate how drugs work at the molecular, cellular and organ levels in treatment of disease. She is the laboratory director for the Bios 20170&#39;s non-majors pre-med sequence. 
 
 What are some examples of things we might do? 
 Basic lab skills and communication skills are taught during the summer, throughout a variety of lab exercises. Labs that have been taught in the past include Cell Culture , Cell Biology , Taste Variation , and RNA Interference . 
 Is there a sample syllabus available to view? 
 You may view a sample syllabus here . 
 
 We hope you&#39;ll consider this unique experience! Dr. Schonbaum likes teaching RIBS (as Research in the Biological Sciences is known) &ldquo;because it provides an opportunity to work with a group of talented students who can focus on biology for a month without having to worry about exams, or other distractions (except perhaps the late night soccer games).&rdquo; RIBS students spend seven to eight hours a day in lab for four weeks. If one word can summarize the RIBS experience, it would be intensive. This intensity, however, is what makes RIBS so uniquely rewarding. Dr. Schonbaum explains: &ldquo;Unlike most lab courses that students perform in high school or even in college, where labs are offered in two-to-three hour parcels once a week, RIBS immerses the student in four uninterrupted weeks of science. The students carry out more complicated experiments not feasible in the typical short lab period. The continuity gives students a chance to see how ideas are tested by a series of experiments rather than by the performance of a single, isolated exercise. RIBS also gives the students an opportunity to design experiments and to follow up on the results of their experiments.&rdquo; 
 RIBS students are challenged to both work and learn, are trusted with expensive equipment, and are expected to work closely with others. RIBS is not for everyone. You need to love (or at least like!) science and be willing to spend a summer month in a lab. For people who want to learn biology hands-on, rather than from a textbook, however, RIBS is a dream come true. All day we think about biology and do laboratory work. We do this with a lab full of others who share our interest in biology; we get to know each other as well as we get to know the science. And the students get to know themselves better too: &quot;Do they love biological research like they thought they would? Do they successfully work in a group as is done in laboratory science? Can they rise to the challenge of presenting their work?&rdquo;  
 If you have a question not answered in this FAQ, feel free to email Dr. Schonbaum or Dr. Zaragoza with your concerns!

  	   Animal Physiology Major Program Form: 2012-13 , 2011-12, 2010-11 , 2009-10 , 2008-09 
 Comparative Animal Physiology Specialist Program Form: 2007-08 , 2006-07 , 2005-06 
 The specialist program was discontinued at the end of the 2007-08 academic year. Students enrolled in this program may finish it. New students will not be allowed to enrol in it. 
 Comparative animal physiologists compare and contrast the physiological systems of different animal species, or of a single species under difference environmental conditions. This branch of physiology is an experimental science driven by an interest in understanding how physiological systems allow animals to adapt to their individual and ever-changing environments. We seek to answer questions such as: How do aquatic mammals dive for greater than 30 minutes on a single breath of air? Do birds sleep during flight while migrating? How do the heart and brain function of artic and Antarctic fish function at sub-zero temperatures? How do turtles and frog survive at the bottom of ice covered lakes and ponds over winter? By adapting a systems-level approach, from molecules to organisms, comparative animal physiologists are able to understand the emergent properties that arise when physiological components operate as a whole; properties that can not be predicted from knowledge of the individual components alone. 
 In the animal physiology program instruction will explore a broad array of species living in diverse habitats to emphasize the commonality and differences amongst species. In the first and second years of this program students take courses which provide them with a solid background in both the basic sciences and introductory animal physiology, and cell and molecular biology. In the third and fourth years, we offer a series of courses that provide students with an in depth understanding of the major aspects of physiology which include neurophysiology, respiratory physiology, endocrinology, sleep physiology and comparative cellular physiology. In the last year of study students are encouraged to apply to conduct independent research project courses in the laboratories of physiologists within the Department of Cell and Systems Biology.

					 Department of Physiology and Cell Biology 
					  The Department of Physiology and Cell Biology at The Ohio State University has a long history. It is one of the oldest departments in the United States having been established in 1879 by Albert Bleile, a student of Carl Ludwig in 1870. The department has been internationally recognized as a leader in the field of muscle physiology since the days of Professor Emil Bozler (1936-1975). Faculty members in the department are at the forefront of modern physiological research ranging from basic to applied translational research. Their research involves molecular genetics, proteomics / protein expression, cell biology, advanced imaging techniques, expertise in single cell and organ physiology, and genetically engineered transgenic animal models for disease. Students and postdoctoral researchers have opportunities to pursue research in contemporary fields exploring the mechanisms of disease in cardiovascular, neuronal and cancer biology. Our faculty are also actively involved in teaching medical and other professional students, as well as graduate and undergraduate students.    The Ohio State University is an exciting place where students and faculty have the opportunity to interact with not only faculty in College of Medicine, but also with faculty in the Colleges of Veterinary Medicine, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Arts and Sciences, and others across one of the largest University campuses in the country.    The mission of the Department of Physiology and Cell Biology has three major components.    &bull; First is to educate undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the physiological and cell biological sciences and skills basic to the practice of medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, and other allied health professions. Graduate education, which is incorporated in this function, prepares students for careers in physiological and cell biological research, research management, and teaching.   &bull; Second is to conduct basic and applied research that extends the frontiers of physiological and cell biological science at all levels of biological organization from molecules to the whole organism with relevance for the solution of health problems in humans and animals.    &bull; Third is to provide service and expertise to The Ohio State University, the State of Ohio, and national/international biomedical organizations.

 Synthetic biology, an area of research focused on the design and construction of new biological parts and devices, or the re-design of existing biological systems, is an emerging field and the focus of labs and companies around the world. The number of private and public entities conducting research in synthetic biology worldwide grew significantly between 2009 and 2013, according to the latest version of an interactive map produced by the Synthetic Biology Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Like Us on Facebook    
 The map project was started in 2009 and is now populated with more than 500 companies, universities, research institutions and other entities like government labs working on synthetic biology. The highest concentrations of these entities can be found in these hotspots of activity: San Francisco, Boston, Tokyo, Shanghai, London and the traditional German high-tech and pharmaceutical triangle between Munich, Frankfurt and Basel. These hotspots are part of larger regional clusters including California, the East Coast, Western Europe and East Asia. 
 "Part of this new activity has been driven by continuing government investments in the science," said David Rejeski, who directs the Synthetic Biology Project. "Another important factor has been the rapidly declining costs of gene sequencing, which has supported more effective approaches to engineering biological systems."

The Synthetic Biology Project found that the number of companies conducting synthetic biology research increased three-fold since 2009. A plurality of the companies involved in synthetic biology is focusing on developing bio-based specialty chemicals, fuels and/or medicines. 
 Since 2009, the industry has also experienced moderate levels of consolidation and failure, with about 10% of companies included on the initial 2009 inventory been acquired by other companies, closed their doors or can no longer be identified.

 Basic Biology - Organisms and cells 




     
      
      
             
      
       &lt;&lt;&lt; 2/4 &gt;&gt;&gt;       
      
     
     
      
     
       
      
       
      
        
       There are two types of organisms - eukaryotes and prokaryotes 
       
      Bacteria belong to the prokaryotes. However, most organisms 
      which we can see, such as trees, grass, flowers, weeds, worms, flies, mice, 
      cats, dogs, humans, mushrooms and yeast are eukaryotes. The distinction between 
       eukaryotes and prokaryotes is rather important, because many of the cellular 
      building blocks and life processes are quite different in these two organism 
      types. This is believed to be the result of different evolutionary paths. 
       
      Evolution is an important concept in biology, there is a proverb saying that 
      things only make sense in biology in the context of evolution. Most scientists 
      believe that life first emerged on Earth around 3.8 billion years ago. The 
      oldest fossilised bones that have been found resembling bones from anatomically 
      modern humans are about 100,000 - 200,000 years old.       Nobody really knows how 
      life emerged on Earth, but there is lots of scientific evidence regarding how it 
      may have evolved. 
       
       
            Viruses are not quite living organisms, but when inside a living host cell they 
      show some features of a living organism. Viruses are very small in size, characteristically they are about 0.05 - 0.1 micron. Compare this with a eukaryotic human red blood cell which has a size of 5 microns and a prokaryotic cell is about 1micron in size.

  SPOTLIGHT 
  FEATURED ARTICLE IN NEURON 
  &quot; Differential Motion Dynamics of Synaptic Vesicles Undergoing Spontaneous and Activity-Evoked Endocytosis &quot; 
  Amy Peng, Ziv Rotman, Pan-Yue Deng and Vitaly A. Klyachko
  NEURON 73:1108-1115, 2012.
  Synopsis: The authors use nanometer-resolution imaging to examine the dynamic properties of synaptic vesicles in central neurons, with the focus on vesicles supporting two fundamental forms of neurotransmission, the spontaneous and activity-evoked ones. The study demonstrates that the vesicles involved in these two forms of neurotransmission differ in dynamic behavior, particularly in the ability to engage in motor-mediated transport.

 Overview 







 
 
Welcome to the NST IA Physiology of Organisms website! Physiology of Organisms is one of three first-year biological subjects that can be taken by Natural Science students in the University of Cambridge. These pages are intended as a guide to the course, particularly for those students who are thinking of applying to Cambridge, or have just arrived and are trying to choose options. For those students who are already enrolled in Physiology of Organisms, course handouts can be found on the CamTools website.
 
Physiology of Organisms occupies an important central position amongst the three first-year biology subjects on offer at Cambridge: it provides a wider functional context for the material covered in Biology of Cells, and underpins the broader material covered in Evolution and Behaviour. It is a valuable introduction to a wide range of second-year biological options, and is of general interest to anyone curious about how the machinery underlying animal and plant life actually works.
 
Physiology is a broad and intellectually demanding subject. Part of the training of the physiologist is to learn to think about problems on a wider scale, considering the most recent advances in cell and molecular biology without losing sight of the whole organism. This challenging exercise will also train you to think about complex systems in general - useful, for example, in business management.
 
The Physiology of Organisms course does not assume knowledge of A2-level biology or any other course, although some background in biology, chemistry and physics will be useful. It provides a foundation for a wide range of second-year (NST Part IB) subjects including Animal Biology, Ecology, Neurobiology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Plant and Microbial Sciences and, of course, Physiology.

  Commentary Nature Reports Stem Cells Published online: 25 June 2009 | doi :10.1038/stemcells.2009.90  Stem cell: what's in a name? Shahragim Tajbakhsh 1  Clearer terminology could alleviate confusion In the exploding field of stem cell biology, confusion pervades among some newcomers, and even veterans. The question is simple: When do we call a cell - stem cell? Some would argue that a fertilized egg is the ultimate stem cell. It is totipotent , giving rise to the embryo and extra-embryonic structures. The more fate-restricted cells of the inner cell mass of a blastocyst give rise to all body tissues and, with appropriate culture, to embryonic stem cells, which are considered to be pluripotent . Yet another term is reserved for the even more fate-restricted often multipotent stem cells, found widely from 8-day-old embryos to 90-year-old bone marrow. But these landmark definitions are slippery. Until a few years ago, for instance, immunologists routinely referred to stem cells in the blood as pluripotent, even though their fates are normally restricted to the blood. This is one potential source of confusion. Jessica Kolman The criteria for a stem cell remain ambiguous. Must stem cells self-renew? If so, the fertilized egg and the cells of the inner cell mass of a blastocyst do not meet their current stem cell appellation. Both will be exhausted as they give rise to derivatives that are unlike themselves. Notably, true self-renewal is a misnomer, because mutations accumulate in the genome with every round of DNA replication; thus, the daughter of a stem cell is marginally distinct, at least by this criterion, from its parent. For practical purposes, however, this imprecision is tolerated. Historically, the word stammzelle (German for stem cell 1,  2 ; see also 3,  4 ) had a dual meaning: the first being the evolutionary unicellular ancestor of multicellular organisms, and the second being the ancestral (ontological) stem cell of a tissue in an organism, initially in the germ line. Subsequently, the term became more widely applied to other tissues. But as the notion of stem cells evolved, the definition also became somewhat muddled, particularly due to loose standards for naming such cells and distinguishing them from their progeny. No naming scheme will be perfect, but certainly alternatives preferable to the current ad hoc situation can be readily imagined. Probably the most puzzling terms are progenitor and precursor &#8212; here, the definitions are murky. Sometimes the progenitor (from Latin pro -, meaning forth, and gignere , meaning to beget) or precursor (from Latin prae -, meaning pre-, and currere , meaning to run) designations were already in place when a more ancestral cell type was discovered, thereby limiting the terms available to identify a new cell state. In other instances, stem cells are referred to as progenitors when the use of the stem cell appellation appears to leave a doubt about their true nature. Hence, the label of 'stem/progenitor' cell. In addition, developmental biologists have traditionally referred to ancestral embryonic cells in their favourite lineage as precursors. Indeed, for any given cell in the embryo, there exists a precursor cell that gives rise to it. Confusion arises also when nomenclature is used in a generic sense to denote any ancestral cell type (for example, precursor = stem cell), as well as in a specific context to denote a specific cell type (for example, precursor = 'blast' cell (neuroblast, myoblast and so forth)). The notion of transit amplifying cells also needs to be parked somewhere in this constantly shifting scheme, and their relationship with progenitors and precursors should be clarified. Generally, the term applies to a class of cells, with a finite life span, that arise from stem cells, proliferate and then differentiate. However, one study in skin proposed that stem cells can yield differentiated cells in the absence of a transit amplifying population 5 . Another intriguing example is the pancreas, in which stem/progenitor cells appeared to play no significant role in adults 6 &#8212; yet some cells mobilized in an adult pancreas injury model do give rise to all islet cell types, including beta cells 7 . Will these pancreatic 'progenitors' self-renew for the lifetime of the organism, and, if so, should they be considered as stem cells &#8211; or will they be exhausted during that round of regeneration? The model of blood or haematopoietic stem cells provides an elegant paradigm for stem cell biology and tissue generation: an assortment of highly divergent cell types are derived from a well-characterized stem cell. The more committed haematopoietic progenitors may be viewed as self-renewing, to a limited extent, or simply proliferating - and they give rise to multiple cell types before being exhausted. In this context, 'progenitor' reflects an unspecified cell that can normally generate multiple cell types &#8212; as is also the case in the central nervous system. Notably, during stem cell expansion, self-renewal needs to be operationally distinguished from proliferation; sometimes this distinction, which requires a sort of balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, is not clear-cut. The haematopoietic system has provided numerous insights, yet it has also inflicted a tragic nomenclature upon us &#8212; 'short-term' and 'long-term' stem cells &#8212; referring to the capacity of the cells to generate the lineage over a given time interval following their transplantation. Although useful in that context and assay, a terminology that can be translated to other tissues and species may be more convenient. A mayfly lives for about a day, whereas some turtles persist for a couple of centuries. Self-renewal is a luxury in the former, but a necessity for tissue regeneration in the latter. Thus, for comparative purposes across species and tissues, transposable criteria, other than time, are desirable for relating different cell states. Currently, the generic nomenclature used for identifying cell states may hold us hostage to biased thinking. Bias and confusion can arise when a cell state is named before it is fully characterised. If some cell types follow a non-canonical lineage progression during tissue regeneration, their differentiating cell states may not fit a generic nomenclature scheme. In addition, just as skin may sometimes not require a transit&#8211;amplifying population to maintain the tissue, 5 not all embryonic tissues will produce all of the anticipated generic cell states during normal organogenesis. This would result in apparent 'gaps' in the naming scheme. Is there a solution to the confusion? Some measure of clarity could be obtained if the fertilized egg and other cells that establish tissues are referred to as founder cells rather than as stem cells. This can distinguish them from the self-renewing cells that emerge as organogenesis concludes. Subsequently, one can identify tissue-specific stem cells, typically postnatal, that can self-renew. Jessica Kolman Furthermore, with generic terms, there is an implicit assumption that all lineages have the same number of cell states (for example, stem cell to transit amplifying cell (progenitor? + precursor?) to differentiated cell). As indicated above, this may not be the case 5 . Instead, cells could be named within their specific context &#8212; their lineage &#8212; of parents and grandparents, daughters and granddaughters. The notion of stem cells arose with investigations in embryology, hence envisaging these cells in a developmental biology context is constructive. Here, the position that a cell occupies within a lineage progression would be a landmark (though reprogramming, cell state reversal and transdifferentiation would have to be factored into this equation). With this view, one can temporarily dispense with problematic terms (stem cell, progenitor cell, precursor cell) and identify criteria that distinguish cell states in the form of A B C D and so forth in which the last state depicts the differentiated and mature phenotype. In this way, all states can be designated if they display a characteristic chromatin/epigenetic signature and gene-expression pattern. This would apply also to mesenchymal stem cells, which give rise to multiple cell types, and are found in diverse tissues and organs. They would slip into different lineages in tissues and organs, presumably as specific states, to achieve the differentiated phenotype. Cultured cells, cancer cells, cells undergoing regeneration, or reprogrammed cells may not follow a predictable lineage progression. Nevertheless, defining distinct cell states in those cases is also a necessity for their proper characterisation. Another bias with the nomenclature currently in use is the assumption that only one stem cell entity exists in any given tissue. This may also be incorrect; one can imagine having A1, A2...A n as different stem cells in any given tissue (B1, B2...B n and C1, C2...C n for their daughters and granddaughters). Indeed, some haematopoietic stem cells were suggested to already exhibit lineage bias 8 . Skeletal muscle provides another example &#8212; the embryonic counterparts of adult satellite 'stem' cells are born with distinct genetic signatures that depend on their location. Interestingly, they can maintain this ontological signature to some extent in adults 9 . Hence, this tissue is composed of different stem cells with distinct genetic signatures. Therein lies another challenge. Due to current technical limitations, arguably every stem cell population being examined prospectively is heterogeneous, consisting of 'stem-like' cells and more committed cells. In some cases, this represents a single stem cell state 'breathing' within the limits of transcriptional noise. In others, bona fide distinct cell states are being observed. Stem cells may also differ from each other at the single cell level due to fluctuations in gene expression. In some cases, stem/progenitor cells may refrain from participating in normal tissue turnover, and thus escape detection until they are unveiled after an acute injury 7 . Defining the true stem cell state, be it fixed or not, is one of the major challenges in this field. But, the unbiased scheme also has some pitfalls. In the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the central nervous system, type 'B' and 'A' cells were designated historically prior to knowledge regarding their lineage relationships. Another cell type in this lineage was eventually called 'C'. Further characterisation revealed the stem cells to be 'B', the neuroblast 'A', and the intermediary progenitor to be 'C' &#8212; so oddly, we are left with B C A (ref. 10 ). No naming scheme will be perfect, but certainly alternatives preferable to the current ad hoc situation can be readily imagined (See Box 1 ). In the field of reprogramming and induced pluripotent cells, reference cell states, preferably not associated with inherently biased definitions, are crucial for clarity. Of course, what a cell is called may not matter if it can reconstitute a failing organ. Although precise language may not be a formal necessity, it could nevertheless lower barriers of conception and communication and thereby alleviate some of the confusion to achieve at least one key goal &#8212; using the right cell types to get cell therapies to work. Ultimately, what's in a name? A lot, but often, very little. Box 1. Terminology summary  The designations 'stem', 'progenitor' and 'precursor' are currently used as somewhat generic terms to denote an ancestral cell &#8212; as well as occasionally being used in a specific context to denote a particular cell state. Fertilized eggs and other embryonic stem cells that establish tissues and organs can be viewed as 'founder' cells. Self-renewing cells that emerge as organogenesis is concluding may be considered 'stem cells'. Non-generic terms may be employed that designate a cell state, its parent and its daughter in a lineage progression.  Top of page

      Format of Papers  
    
   
       
   
    Preparation of manuscripts 
 The manuscript should be double-spaced throughout using 11pt Times New Roman/Arial. Number all pages,beginning from section of title page, and followed by abstract, introduction, materials and methods, results, discussion, acknowledgements, references, figure legends and figures/tables.Gene symbols should be italicized; protein products are not italicized. Non-standard abbreviations should be defind when first used in the text. 
  
  Title page: The title page should include: Full title (a brief declarative statement of the major findings of the research), Running title (no more than 60 characters including spaces), and corresponding author's contact information. 
  
  Abstract: The abstract should briefly (no more than 250 words) describe in complete sentences the scope of the investigation, the results obtained and the major conclusions.3-7 keywords should be given after the abstract. 
  
  Introduction: The introduction should begin with a brief introduction of background related to the research and should be as concise as possible. 
  
  Results: The results should present the experimental data in tables and figures with suitable descriptions. 
  
  Discussion: The discussion should focus on the interpretation and significance of the findings with concise objective comments. 
    Materials and Methods: The materials and methods should be described clearly and referenced in sufficient detail. 
    
   Acknowledgments: The acknowledgements should be brief and include references to financial supports along with the numbers of grants. 
      Gene nomenclature: Authors should use approved nomenclature for gene symbols, and use symbols rather than italicized full names ( Ttn , not titin). Please consult the appropriate nomenclature databases for correct gene names and symbols.For proposed gene names that are not already approved, please submit the gene symbols to the appropriate nomenclature committees as soon as possible, as these must be deposited and approved before publication of an article. Avoid listing multiple names of genes (or proteins) separated by a slash, as in &lsquo; Oct4/Pou5f1 &rsquo;, as this is ambiguous (it could mean a ratio, a complex, alternative names or different subunits). Use one name throughout and include the other at first mention: &lsquo; Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1 )&rsquo;. 
   
   
   
   References 
   The references should include only articles that are published or in press. The references are each numbered, ordered sequentially as they appear in the text. List all authors unless there are more than 6, in which case only the first 3 should be given, followed by &ldquo; et al &rdquo;. 
 Please use the following style for references:

    Figures 
    Figures and images should be labeled sequentially, numbered and cited in the text. Figure legends should be printed and double-spaced on a separate sheet titled &lsquo;Titles and legends to figures&rsquo;. Figures should be referred to specifically in the text of the paper but should not be embedded within the text. The use of three-dimensional histograms is strongly discouraged when the addition of the third dimension gives no extra information. If a table or figure has been published before, the authors must obtain written permission to reproduce the material in both print and electronic formats from the copyright owner and submit it with the manuscript. This follows for quotes, illustrations and other materials taken from previously published works not in the public domain. 
 For initial submission, figures could be embedded with the text as one Word file. For a revised manuscript, tiff , psd and jpeg are the only acceptable formats for the figures, which should be submitted separately. Use quality graphic programs such as Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Illustrator, Corel Draw, or Freehand to create your figures. Figures should be approximately the same size as you would like them to appear in press. 
    
    
 Note: While an image may look perfect on the screen, it is often of insufficient resolution for publication. Try viewing your figure at 100% and 300 dpi in resolution on the screen; if it is not blurry, it is probably of high enough resolution for the printing process.
  Figure legends 
  Legends must be submitted for all figures. They should be brief and specific, and should appear on a separate manuscript page after the Reference section. Use scale markers in the image for electron micrographs, and indicate the type of stain used. 
  Tables 
  These should be labeled sequentially as Table 1, Table 2, etc. Each table should be typed on a separate page, numbered and titled, and cited in the text. Reference to table footnotes should be made by means of Arabic numerals. Tables should not duplicate the content of the text. They should consist of at least two columns; columns should always have headings.Authors should ensure that the data in the tables are consistent with those cited in the relevant places in the text, totals add up correctly, and percentages have been calculated correctly.Supply tables as Word, Excel or HTML files (one table per file). Include the table title and legend in the table file. 
  House style 
  As the electronic submission will provide the basic material for typesetting, it is important that papers are prepared in the general editorial style of the journal. 
  1.Do not make rules thinner than 1 pt (0.36mm) 
  2.Use a coarse hatching pattern rather than shading for tints in graphs 
  3.Color should be distinct when used as an identifying tool 
  4.Use SI units throughout 
  5.Spaces, not commas should be used to separate thousands 
  6.Abbreviations should be preceded by the words for which they stand in the first instance of use 
  7.Text should be double spaced with a wide margin 
  
   File formats 
  File formats for manuscript files, figures and tables that are acceptable for our electronic manuscript submission process are given on the online forms. Please follow our artwork guidelines for submitting figures, and use a common word-processing package (such as Microsoft Word) for the text.

A germination rate experiment 
 
 
 Plant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning, or physiology , of plants . [ 1 ] Closely related fields include plant morphology (structure of plants), plant ecology (interactions with the environment), phytochemistry ( biochemistry of plants), cell biology , genetics, biophysics and molecular biology . 
 Fundamental processes such as photosynthesis , respiration , plant nutrition , plant hormone functions, tropisms , nastic movements , photoperiodism , photomorphogenesis , circadian rhythms , environmental stress physiology, seed germination , dormancy and stomata function and transpiration , both parts of plant water relations, are studied by plant physiologists.

 [ edit ] Aims 
 The field of plant physiology includes the study of all the internal activities of plants—those chemical and physical processes associated with life as they occur in plants. This includes study at many levels of scale of size and time. At the smallest scale are molecular interactions of photosynthesis and internal diffusion of water, minerals, and nutrients. At the largest scale are the processes of plant development , seasonality , dormancy , and reproductive control. Major subdisciplines of plant physiology include phytochemistry (the study of the biochemistry of plants) and phytopathology (the study of disease in plants). The scope of plant physiology as a discipline may be divided into several major areas of research. 
 
 
 
  
Five key areas of study within plant physiology. 
 
 
 First, the study of phytochemistry (plant chemistry) is included within the domain of plant physiology. To function and survive, plants produce a wide array of chemical compounds not found in other organisms. Photosynthesis requires a large array of pigments , enzymes , and other compounds to function. Because they cannot move, plants must also defend themselves chemically from herbivores , pathogens and competition from other plants. They do this by producing toxins and foul-tasting or smelling chemicals. Other compounds defend plants against disease, permit survival during drought, and prepare plants for dormancy. While other compounds are used to attract pollinators or herbivores to spread ripe seeds. 
 Secondly, plant physiology includes the study of biological and chemical processes of individual plant cells . Plant cells have a number of features that distinguish them from cells of animals , and which lead to major differences in the way that plant life behaves and responds differently from animal life. For example, plant cells have a cell wall which restricts the shape of plant cells and thereby limits the flexibility and mobility of plants. Plant cells also contain chlorophyll , a chemical compound that interacts with light in a way that enables plants to manufacture their own nutrients rather than consuming other living things as animals do. 
 Thirdly, plant physiology deals with interactions between cells, tissues , and organs within a plant. Different cells and tissues are physically and chemically specialized to perform different functions. Roots and rhizoids function to anchor the plant and acquire minerals in the soil. Leaves catch light in order to manufacture nutrients. For both of these organs to remain living, minerals that the roots acquire must be transported to the leaves, and the nutrients manufactured in the leaves must be transported to the roots. Plants have developed a number of ways to achieve this transport, such as vascular tissue , and the functioning of the various modes of transport is studied by plant physiologists. 
 Fourthly, plant physiologists study the ways that plants control or regulate internal functions. Like animals, plants produce chemicals called hormones which are produced in one part of the plant to signal cells in another part of the plant to respond. Many flowering plants bloom at the appropriate time because of light-sensitive compounds that respond to the length of the night, a phenomenon known as photoperiodism . The ripening of fruit and loss of leaves in the winter are controlled in part by the production of the gas ethylene by the plant. 
 Finally, plant physiology includes the study of how plants respond to conditions and variation in the environment, a field known as environmental physiology . Stress from water loss, changes in air chemistry, or crowding by other plants can lead to changes in the way a plant functions. These changes may be affected by genetic, chemical, and physical factors.

 Main article: Phytochemistry 
 The list of simple elements of which plants are primarily constructed— carbon , oxygen , hydrogen , calcium , phosphorus , etc.—is not different from similar lists for animals, fungi, or even bacteria . The fundamental atomic components of plants are the same as for all life; only the details of the way in which they are assembled differs. 
 Despite this underlying similarity, plants produce a vast array of chemical compounds with unusual properties which they use to cope with their environment. Pigments are used by plants to absorb or detect light, and are extracted by humans for use in dyes . Other plant products may be used for the manufacture of commercially important rubber or biofuel . Perhaps the most celebrated compounds from plants are those with pharmacological activity, such as salicylic acid (aspirin), morphine , and digitalis . Drug companies spend billions of dollars each year researching plant compounds for potential medicinal benefits. 
 [ edit ] Constituent elements 
 Further information: Plant nutrition 
 Plants require some nutrients , such as carbon and nitrogen , in large quantities to survive. Such nutrients are termed macronutrients , where the prefix macro- (large) refers to the quantity needed, not the size of the nutrient particles themselves. Other nutrients, called micronutrients , are required only in trace amounts for plants to remain healthy. Such micronutrients are usually absorbed as ions dissolved in water taken from the soil, though carnivorous plants acquire some of their micronutrients from captured prey. 
 The following tables list element nutrients essential to plants. Uses within plants are generalized.

 Main article: Biological pigment 
 Among the most important molecules for plant function are the pigments . Plant pigments include a variety of different kinds of molecules, including porphyrins , carotenoids , and anthocyanins . All biological pigments selectively absorb certain wavelengths of light while reflecting others. The light that is absorbed may be used by the plant to power chemical reactions , while the reflected wavelengths of light determine the color the pigment appears to the eye. 
 Chlorophyll is the primary pigment in plants; it is a porphyrin that absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light while reflecting green . It is the presence and relative abundance of chlorophyll that gives plants their green color. All land plants and green algae possess two forms of this pigment: chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b . Kelps , diatoms , and other photosynthetic heterokonts contain chlorophyll c instead of b , while red algae possess only chlorophyll a . All chlorophylls serve as the primary means plants use to intercept light to fuel photosynthesis . 
 Carotenoids are red, orange, or yellow tetraterpenoids . They function as accessory pigments in plants, helping to fuel photosynthesis by gathering wavelengths of light not readily absorbed by chlorophyll. The most familiar carotenoids are carotene (an orange pigment found in carrots ), lutein (a yellow pigment found in fruits and vegetables), and lycopene (the red pigment responsible for the color of tomatoes ). Carotenoids have been shown to act as antioxidants and to promote healthy eyesight in humans. 
 Anthocyanins (literally "flower blue") are water-soluble flavonoid pigments that appear red to blue, according to pH . They occur in all tissues of higher plants, providing color in leaves , stems , roots , flowers , and fruits , though not always in sufficient quantities to be noticeable. Anthocyanins are most visible in the petals of flowers, where they may make up as much as 30% of the dry weight of the tissue. [ 2 ] They are also responsible for the purple color seen on the underside of tropical shade plants such as Tradescantia zebrina . In these plants, the anthocyanin catches light that has passed through the leaf and reflects it back towards regions bearing chlorophyll, in order to maximize the use of available light 
 Betalains are red or yellow pigments. Like anthocyanins they are water-soluble, but unlike anthocyanins they are indole -derived compounds synthesized from tyrosine . This class of pigments is found only in the Caryophyllales (including cactus and amaranth ), and never co-occur in plants with anthocyanins. Betalains are responsible for the deep red color of beets , and are used commercially as food-coloring agents. Plant physiologists are uncertain of the function that betalains have in plants which possess them, but there is some preliminary evidence that they may have fungicidal properties. [ 3 ] 
 [ edit ] Signals and regulators 
 
 
 
  
A mutation that stops Arabidopsis thaliana responding to auxin causes abnormal growth (right) 
 
 
 Plants produce hormones and other growth regulators which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues. They also produce compounds such as phytochrome that are sensitive to light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals. 
 [ edit ] Plant hormones 
 Main article: Plant hormone 
 Plant hormones , known as plant growth regulators (PGRs) or phytohormones, are chemicals that regulate a plant's growth. According to a standard animal definition, hormones are signal molecules produced at specific locations, that occur in very low concentrations, and cause altered processes in target cells at other locations. Unlike animals, plants lack specific hormone-producing tissues or organs. Plant hormones are often not transported to other parts of the plant and production is not limited to specific locations. 
 Plant hormones are chemicals that in small amounts promote and influence the growth , development and differentiation of cells and tissues. Hormones are vital to plant growth; affecting processes in plants from flowering to seed development, dormancy , and germination . They regulate which tissues grow upwards and which grow downwards, leaf formation and stem growth, fruit development and ripening, as well as leaf abscission and even plant death. 
 The most important plant hormones are abscissic acid (ABA), auxins , ethylene , gibberellins , and cytokinins , though there are many other substances that serve to regulate plant physiology. 
 [ edit ] Photomorphogenesis 
 Main article: Photomorphogenesis 
 While most people know that light is important for photosynthesis in plants, few realize that plant sensitivity to light plays a role in the control of plant structural development ( morphogenesis ). The use of light to control structural development is called photomorphogenesis , and is dependent upon the presence of specialized photoreceptors , which are chemical pigments capable of absorbing specific wavelengths of light. 
 Plants use four kinds of photoreceptors: [ 1 ]  phytochrome , cryptochrome , a UV-B photoreceptor, and protochlorophyllide a . The first two of these, phytochrome and cryptochrome, are photoreceptor proteins , complex molecular structures formed by joining a protein with a light-sensitive pigment. Cryptochrome is also known as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs ultraviolet light in the long wave "A" region. The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests carotene or riboflavin as candidates. [ 4 ] Protochlorophyllide a , as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of chlorophyll . 
 The most studied of the photoreceptors in plants is phytochrome . It is sensitive to light in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum . Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based on the length of day and night ( photoperiodism ) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings. 
 [ edit ] Photoperiodism 
 
 
 
  
The poinsettia is a short-day plant, requiring two months of long nights prior to blooming. 
 
 
 Main article: Photoperiodism 
 Many flowering plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism . Broadly speaking, flowering plants can be classified as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to initiate flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity ( vernalization ) instead. 
 Although a short day plant cannot flower during the long days of summer, it is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering. Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24 hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin. It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of phytochrome activating light is used on the plant during the night. 
 Plants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod. This fact is utilized by florists and greenhouse gardeners to control and even induce flowering out of season, such as the Poinsettia . 
 [ edit ] Environmental physiology 
 
 
 
  
 Phototropism in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by blue to UV light. [ 5 ] 
 
 
 Main article: Ecophysiology 
 Paradoxically, the subdiscipline of environmental physiology is on the one hand a recent field of study in plant ecology and on the other hand one of the oldest. [ 1 ] Environmental physiology is the preferred name of the subdiscipline among plant physiologists, but it goes by a number of other names in the applied sciences. It is roughly synonymous with ecophysiology , crop ecology, horticulture and agronomy . The particular name applied to the subdiscipline is specific to the viewpoint and goals of research. Whatever name is applied, it deals with the ways in which plants respond to their environment and so overlaps with the field of ecology . 
 Environmental physiologists examine plant response to physical factors such as radiation (including light and ultraviolet radiation), temperature , fire , and wind . Of particular importance are water relations (which can be measured with the Pressure bomb ) and the stress of drought or inundation , exchange of gases with the atmosphere , as well as the cycling of nutrients such as nitrogen and carbon . 
 Environmental physiologists also examine plant response to biological factors. This includes not only negative interactions, such as competition , herbivory , disease and parasitism , but also positive interactions, such as mutualism and pollination . 
 [ edit ] Tropisms and nastic movements 
 Main articles: Tropism and Nastic movement 
 Plants may respond both to directional and nondirectional stimuli . A response to a directional stimulus, such as gravity or sun light , is called a tropism. A response to a nondirectional stimulus, such as temperature or humidity , is a nastic movement. 
 Tropisms in plants are the result of differential cell growth, in which the cells on one side of the plant elongate more than those on the other side, causing the part to bend toward the side with less growth. Among the common tropisms seen in plants is phototropism , the bending of the plant toward a source of light. Phototropism allows the plant to maximize light exposure in plants which require additional light for photosynthesis, or to minimize it in plants subjected to intense light and heat. Geotropism allows the roots of a plant to determine the direction of gravity and grow downwards. Tropisms generally result from an interaction between the environment and production of one or more plant hormones. 
 In contrast to tropisms, nastic movements result from changes in turgor pressure within plant tissues, and may occur rapidly. A familiar example is thigmonasty (response to touch) in the Venus fly trap , a carnivorous plant . The traps consist of modified leaf blades which bear sensitive trigger hairs. When the hairs are touched by an insect or other animal, the leaf folds shut. This mechanism allows the plant to trap and digest small insects for additional nutrients. Although the trap is rapidly shut by changes in internal cell pressures, the leaf must grow slowly to reset for a second opportunity to trap insects. [ 6 ] 
 [ edit ] Plant disease 
 
 
 
  
 Powdery mildew on crop leaves 
 
 
 Main article: Phytopathology 
 Economically, one of the most important areas of research in environmental physiology is that of phytopathology , the study of diseases in plants and the manner in which plants resist or cope with infection. Plant are susceptible to the same kinds of disease organisms as animals, including viruses , bacteria , and fungi , as well as physical invasion by insects and roundworms . 
 Because the biology of plants differs from animals, their symptoms and responses are quite different. In some cases, a plant can simply shed infected leaves or flowers to prevent the spread of disease, in a process called abscission. Most animals do not have this option as a means of controlling disease. Plant diseases organisms themselves also differ from those causing disease in animals because plants cannot usually spread infection through casual physical contact. Plant pathogens tend to spread via spores or are carried by animal vectors . 
 One of the most important advances in the control of plant disease was the discovery of Bordeaux mixture in the nineteenth century. The mixture is the first known fungicide and is a combination of copper sulfate and lime . Application of the mixture served to inhibit the growth of downy mildew that threatened to seriously damage the French wine industry. [ 7 ] 
 [ edit ] History 
 [ edit ] Early history 
 
 
 
  
 Jan Baptist van Helmont . 
 
 
 Sir Francis Bacon published one of the first plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, Sylva Sylvarum. Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. Jan Baptist van Helmont published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, John Woodward published experiments on growth of spearmint in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water. 
 Stephen Hales is considered the Father of Plant Physiology for the many experiments in the 1727 book; [ 8 ] though Julius von Sachs unified the pieces of plant physiology and put them together as a discipline. His Lehrbuch der Botanik was the plant physiology bible of its time. [ 9 ] 
 Researchers discovered in the 1800s that plants absorb essential mineral nutrients as inorganic ions in water. In natural conditions, soil acts as a mineral nutrient reservoir but the soil itself is not essential to plant growth. When the mineral nutrients in the soil are dissolved in water, plant roots absorb nutrients readily, soil is no longer required for the plant to thrive. This observation is the basis for hydroponics , the growing of plants in a water solution rather than soil, which has become a standard technique in biological research, teaching lab exercises, crop production and as a hobby. 
 [ edit ] Current research 
 One of the leading journals in the field is Plant Physiology , started in 1926. All its back issues are available online for free. [1] Many other journals often carry plant physiology articles, including Physiologia Plantarum , Journal of Experimental Botany , American Journal of Botany , Annals of Botany , Journal of Plant Nutrition and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 
 [ edit ] Economic applications 
 [ edit ] Food production 
 Further information: Agriculture and Horticulture 
 In horticulture and agriculture along with food science , plant physiology is an important topic relating to fruits , vegetables , and other consumable parts of plants. Topics studied include: climatic requirements, fruit drop, nutrition, ripening , fruit set. The production of food crops also hinges on the study of plant physiology covering such topics as Optimal planting and harvesting times and post harvest storage of plant products for human consumption and the production of secondary products like drugs and cosmetics.

     The Basics 
     
    
    
     
    
    
      
     1. What is evolution? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     Biological evolution refers to the cumulative changes that occur in a population over time. 
    These changes are produced at the genetic level as organisms' genes mutate and/or recombine in different ways during 
    reproduction and are passed on to future generations. Sometimes, individuals inherit new characteristics that give them a 
    survival and reproductive advantage in their local environments; these characteristics tend to increase in 
    frequency in the population, while those that are disadvantageous decrease in frequency. This process of differential 
    survival and reproduction is known as natural selection. Non-genetic changes that occur during an organism's life span, 
    such as increases in muscle mass due to exercise and diet, cannot be passed on to the next generation and are not examples 
    of evolution.

     2. Isn't evolution just a theory that remains unproven? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     In science, a theory is a rigorously tested statement of general principles that explains 
    observable and recorded aspects of the world. A scientific theory therefore describes a higher level of understanding 
    that ties "facts" together. A scientific theory stands until proven wrong -- it is never proven correct. The Darwinian 
    theory of evolution has withstood the test of time and thousands of scientific experiments; nothing has disproved it 
    since Darwin first proposed it more than 150 years ago. Indeed, many scientific advances, in a range of scientific 
    disciplines including physics, geology, chemistry, and molecular biology, have supported, refined, and expanded 
    evolutionary theory far beyond anything Darwin could have imagined.

     3. Are all species related? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     Yes. Just as the tree of life illustrates, all organisms, both living and extinct, are related. 
    Every branch of the tree represents a species, and every fork separating one species from another represents 
    the common ancestor shared by these species. While the tree's countless forks and far-reaching branches clearly 
    show that relatedness among species varies greatly, it is also easy to see that every pair of species share a common 
    ancestor from some point in evolutionary history. For example, scientists estimate that the common ancestor shared by 
    humans and chimpanzees lived some 5 to 8 million years ago. Humans and bacteria obviously share a much more distant common ancestor, 
    but our relationship to these single-celled organisms is no less real. Indeed, DNA analyses show that although 
    humans share far more genetic material with our fellow primates than we do with single-celled organisms, 
    we still have more than 200 genes in common with bacteria. 
     
    It is important to realize that describing organisms as relatives does not mean that one of those 
    organisms is an ancestor of the other, or, for that matter, that any living species is the ancestor of 
    any other living species. A person may be related to blood relatives, such as cousins, aunts, and uncles, 
    because she shares with them one or more common ancestors, such as a grandparent, or great-grandparent. 
    But those cousins, aunts, and uncles are not her ancestors. In the same way, humans and other living primates 
    are related, but none of these living relatives is a human ancestor.

     4. What is a species? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     Members of one species do not normally interbreed with members of other 
    species in nature. Sometimes, members of different species, such as lions and tigers, can interbreed if 
    kept together in captivity. But in nature, geographic isolation and differences in behavior, such as choice 
    of habitat, keep these sorts of closely related animal species apart. Similarly, closely related species of 
    plants can sometimes be hybridized by horticulturists, but these hybrids are rarely found in nature. A species, 
    then, is defined by science as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that is 
    reproductively isolated from other such groups.

     5. What do genes have to do with evolution? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    Genes are the portions of an organism's DNA that carry the code responsible for building 
    that organism in a very specific way. Genes -- and, thus, the traits they code for -- are passed
     from parent to offspring. From generation to generation, well-understood molecular mechanisms reshuffle, 
     duplicate, and alter genes in a way that produces genetic variation. This variation is the raw material for evolution.

     6. What role does sex play in evolution? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    Sexual reproduction allows an organism to combine half of its genes with half 
    of another individual's genes, which means new combinations of genes are 
    produced every generation. In addition, when eggs and sperm are produced, 
    genetic material is shuffled and recombined in ways that produce new combinations 
    of genes. Sexual reproduction thus increases genetic variation, which increases the raw 
    material on which natural selection operates. Genetic variation within a species -- also 
    known as genetic diversity -- increases a species' opportunity for change over successive generations.

     7. Is evolution a random process? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    Evolution is not a random process. The genetic variation on which natural selection acts 
    may occur randomly, but natural selection itself is not random at all. The survival and 
    reproductive success of an individual is directly related to the ways its inherited traits 
    function in the context of its local environment. Whether or not an individual survives and 
    reproduces depends on whether it has genes that produce traits that are well adapted to its environment.

     8. Are evolution and "survival of the fittest" the same thing? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    Evolution and "survival of the fittest" are not the same thing. Evolution refers to the 
    cumulative changes in a population or species through time. "Survival of the fittest" is a 
    popular term that refers to the process of natural selection, a mechanism that drives evolutionary change. 
    Natural selection works by giving individuals who are better adapted to a given set of environmental 
    conditions an advantage over those that are not as well adapted. Survival of the fittest usually makes 
    one think of the biggest, strongest, or smartest individuals being the winners, but in a biological sense, 
    evolutionary fitness refers to the ability to survive and reproduce in a particular environment. Popular 
    interpretations of "survival of the fittest" typically ignore the importance of both reproduction and cooperation.
     To survive but not pass on one's genes to the next generation is to be biologically unfit. And many organisms 
     are the "fittest" because they cooperate with other organisms, rather than competing with them.

     9. How does natural selection work? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    In the process of natural selection, individuals in a population who are well-adapted
     to a particular set of environmental conditions have an advantage over those who are 
     not so well adapted. The advantage comes in the form of survival and reproductive success. 
     For example, those individuals who are better able to find and use a food resource will, on 
     average, live longer and produce more offspring than those who are less successful at finding food.
     Inherited traits that increase individuals' fitness are then passed to their offspring, thus giving the 
     offspring the same advantages.

     10. How do organisms evolve? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    Individual organisms don't evolve. Populations evolve. Because individuals in a population 
    vary, some in the population are better able to survive and reproduce given a particular set 
    of environmental conditions. These individuals generally survive and produce more offspring, 
    thus passing their advantageous traits on to the next generation. Over time, the population changes.

     11. Does evolution prove there is no God? 
     
    
    
     
    
    
     
     
    No. Many people, from evolutionary biologists to important religious figures like Pope 
    John Paul II, contend that the time-tested theory of evolution does not refute the presence 
    of God. They acknowledge that evolution is the description of a process that governs the 
    development of life on Earth. Like other scientific theories, including Copernican theory, atomic 
    theory, and the germ theory of disease, evolution deals only with objects, events, and processes 
    in the material world. Science has nothing to say one way or the other about the existence of God 
    or about people's spiritual beliefs.

 Using Model Organisms to Study Health and Disease 

			
			
			
			
			
			
				 Basic research using model organisms has taught us much of what we know about biology. This research has identified the fundamental properties of how cells grow and divide, how inheritance works, and how organisms store and use energy. By studying model organisms, scientists are learning more about how the brain functions and what drives behaviors like eating, sleeping, sex and even aggression. This foundation of knowledge has led to new methods for maintaining health and for diagnosing and treating disease in humans.  What is a model? The word model has many meanings, but in science, a model is a simplified system that is accessible and easily manipulated. A model organism is an animal, plant or microbe that can be used to study certain biological processes. Why use model organisms? Research on bacteria, yeast, insects, worms, fish, rodents and plants has shown that the basic operating principles are nearly the same in all living things. So a finding made in fruit flies can shed light on a biological process in people. Model organisms generally grow quickly, are relatively simple and inexpensive to work with, and are widely available for use in experiments. Why is model organism research useful for studying diseases? The natural course of a disease in a human may take dozens of years. Simple organisms that can develop a disease or some of its symptoms make it possible for researchers to learn about the disease faster—in a period of months to a few years. That would be nearly impossible, and often unethical, to do in humans. When scientists discover that a particular gene is associated with a disease in humans, one of the first things they typically do is find out what that gene does in a model organism. This often provides important clues for understanding the cause of a disease and for developing potential diagnostic tests and treatments. How has model organism research impacted human health? Here are a few of the many examples: Yeast studies sorted out the orderly sequence of events, called the cell cycle, in which a cell duplicates its contents and divides into two. This information has benefited millions of people, since many drugs used to treat cancer act by interfering with the cell cycle. Experiments performed with yeast have also clarified how genes are turned on or off. This knowledge explains how cells that contain the same genes can be so different from one another, which has advanced understanding of both normal developmental processes and diseases that occur when genes are turned on or off at the wrong time or in the wrong cell. Studies in fruit flies and tiny worms taught scientists key aspects of how fertilized eggs develop into complex organisms. In the course of these studies, researchers made unanticipated discoveries, such as learning that genetically controlled cell death plays a critical role in cancer and other diseases.  Research with bacteria, viruses and yeast has revealed how all living things pass on their genes to offspring through copying DNA and fixing mistakes that get made during the copying process. Laboratory rats have been used for many decades to test drugs. In addition, much of what we know about cancer-causing molecules was learned through basic research with rats. Mice can be genetically engineered to serve as models of Lou Gehrig’s disease and many other human illnesses. Insects such as fruit flies and honeybees are important models for learning how genes and the environment interact to affect behavior. Studies with fruit flies, bread mold, bacteria and mice have defined the basic rules of circadian clocks, which drive daily biological rhythms, and revealed connections between these clocks and sleep deprivation, obesity, diabetes, depression and other human health conditions. Research in worms has yielded important information about aging. This research is very difficult to do in people and other organisms that have long life spans. Model organism research has produced many powerful tools used by scientists all over the world. Examples include RNA interference , DNA chips and genome-wide scanning methods. These tools are now being used in human health studies.  What more can model organism research tell us? Scientists still do not have a good understanding of biological complexity, in which many molecular networks operate in synchrony inside our bodies. Researchers are mapping these networks in bacteria, yeast and other model organisms, and those studies will be instructive for creating working models of how cells, organs and tissues function in people. Model organisms can also help reveal changes at the molecular level that are associated with diseases and identify diseases that are related to one another even though they initially may not appear to be. If there is already a drug to treat one of the diseases, scientists can then explore whether it might work for the related ones, as well. What about computer models?  Computers serve as virtual laboratories where scientists can do experiments that are very difficult to do in real life. For example, in computer-simulated environments, researchers can introduce into a virtual human population a virus with certain characteristics and then watch it spread. They can also test what might happen as a result of vaccination, school closure or other interventions. Because the models are so complex, high-performance computers are needed to generate many computer simulations. Often, these computers run for weeks at a time, generating millions of different possible outcomes. No single set of results or single computer model can predict exactly what will happen, so researchers often ask the same questions in different kinds of models. When different models yield similar results, scientists have more confidence in the predictions. Can computer models replace animal models in research? Even though computer models are limited by what is already known about a process or disease, they are valuable tools that scientists can use to suggest ideas that then can be tested in real organisms. The information that results from the experiments continually enhances the computer modeling approaches. Thus, the two types of models go hand in hand, relying on each other to advance our understanding of health.

											 Scientific Nomenclature, or How Biological Organisms Are Named 
					
					 
						 Hopefully you&#8217;ve already looked over my page about taxonomy and have an idea of how biological organisms are classified.  (If not, it might be helpful to take a look at that before reading further.)  This page covers how biological organisms are named and what you can learn about organisms based on the scientific words that are associated with them. 
 Because I&#8217;m an entomologist, I usually only think of things that belong to the class Hexapoda (Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Arthropoda), or the organisms with exoskeletons, six legs, and three body segments.  In fact, we don&#8217;t even think about the class so much, but the orders are very important.  If you&#8217;ve ever had to make an insect collection for a class, you know that there are lots of different insect orders.  Insect orders encompass broad groups of organisms.  For example, the beetles, Order Coleoptera, includes more known species than all the other non-insect animals combined!  The order names within Animalia do not have any specific guidelines beyond having a capital letter at the beginning of the word, but if you know Latin, Greek, or your root words you will notice that their names are often very descriptive.  (The names of groups at other levels of classification are also often descriptive in this way.)  The suffix -ptera refers to wings.  Coleop- refers to sheaths.  Thus, the word Coleoptera means sheathed wings.  This describes their hardened outer wings, or elytra, that cover and protect the membranous flying wings underneath. 
 Family names have a few more guidelines.  Animal families end with the suffix -idae and start with a capital letter.  Let&#8217;s look at the name for the group I work with, the Belostomatidae.  You can tell this is a family, and not any other level of classification, because it has the suffix -idae at the end of the word and starts with a capital B.  This is complicated a little when scientists shorten the word to make reference to all of the members of the group in more casual conversation.  For example, it&#8217;s easier to say &#8220;belostomatids&#8221; than &#8220;insects belonging to the family Belostomatidae.&#8221;  When we shorten a family name, the capital letter comes off, along with some of the letters are the end of the word.  In my blog, I will be referring to things by these shortened family names (orders too!), so now you&#8217;ll know why I do that and what it signifies. 
 All described species of biological organisms have a two word name associated with them.  For example, one of the species of water bugs I work on is named Abedus herberti .  If you recall from the page on taxonomy, the first word is the genus and the second is the specific species within the genus.  All genera and species names are italicized when we write about them, so if you ever see a name of an organism in italics, you know you&#8217;re looking at either a genus or a species.  You can tell whether it is a genus or species by looking at the capital letters in the word.  The genus name is always capitalized, but the species name is not. 
 Sometimes scientists will shorten the scientific names of species to make them easier to talk and write about.  There are rules about how this works that are more or less well accepted.  The first time you write or talk about a species, you are supposed to use the full name.  If I wanted to talk about that water bug for the first time during a presentation, I would need to use the full name, Abedus herberti .  The second time I mentioned it, I could shorten it to A. herberti. By this point, you&#8217;ve already heard the full name, so there&#8217;s no need to mention the genus name again.  In printed publications, it&#8217;s standard practice to include the full name in each section of a document so that readers are reminded of exactly what organism you&#8217;re referring to, in case they&#8217;ve forgotten. 
 So, the next time you see me write the word odonate, you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m talking about a member of the order Odonata (the dragonflies and damselflies).  If I use the word belostomatid, you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m talking about a member of the family Belostomatidae.  It all makes sense once you&#8217;ve played around a little with the words and have an idea of what they mean, so keep reading and it will become easier!

		 Stumbled on to your web site. Very nice. I have been collecting &#8220;bugs&#8221; for 50 years, and learned some things today. Do you have a collection? What&#8217;s your favorite order? I live in Central America (Panama) and get to see lots of bugs. Thanks, 
Joe

		 Hello! Glad to hear that you learned something new &#8211; that&#8217;s what I strive for! And yes, I do have a collection. I&#8217;ve been collecting since I was about 12 years old, though I don&#8217;t really go on many collecting trips anymore outside of my work with aquatic insects, so my collection isn&#8217;t gigantic, about 8 drawers total and probably 500 vials. My favorite orders are the Odonata followed closely by the Megaloptera (if you still consider them separate from Neuroptera) and Hemiptera. Honestly though, I like all aquatic insects, regardless of which orders they belong to. Dragonflies, hellgrammites, giant water bugs, and water scorpions are my absolute favorites! How about you?

Biological Classification and Evolutionary Analysis 
 
 
 
 Biological Classification 
 It's no secret that humans (with the notable exception of college 
students) like to keep things organized. Garages, libraries, laboratories
and workshops are easier to work in if there is a system in place to keep
track of things. Wrenches go in this drawer, screwdrivers go in that
drawer, drills go in that cabinet. Biology is no exception. Its a lot
easier to study living things if we have a system that keeps some things
apart from other things. Biologists call this system taxonomy .
Taxonomy took a great leap forward thanks to the efforts of an 18th
century biologist named Linnaeus. What Linnaeus did was devise a
system of binomial nomenclature . A hundred years later, the International Congress of Zoologists set
formal rules for systematically naming things. The rules are: 
 
 Names must be Latin or latinized and are printed in italics. Like
everything else printed in italics, they are underlined when
handwritten. 
 The genus name (the Homo in Homo sapiens ) is
capitalized and must be a single word. 
 The species name ( sapiens in Homo sapiens ) can be
either a single word or a compound word (a new word made up of two
words). 
 Credit for authorship of names will be given to the person who first
publishes it with an accurate and recognizable description of the
organism. 
 
 I won't go crazy about describing binomial nomenclature. The most
important thing for this lab is yet to come. What you should know are
these 4 rules. Typically, you'll see questions on quizzes
or exams like, "Which one of these is the accepted name for a horse?" 
 
 
 equus cabballus 
 Equus Cabballus 
 Equus cabbalus 
 equus Caballus 
 
 
 Even if you didn't know the scientific name of a horse,
you would know 3 is correct because the others break one of the rules 
 What Linnaeus also did was systematically categorize all known
organisms. Linnaeus came up with a hierachy of ways to classify plants and
animals. The different levels are called taxa (plural of
 taxon ). The different taxa are: 
 
 Kingdom 
 Phylum 
 Class 
 Order 
 Family 
 Genus 
 Species 
 
 Kingdom is the broadest of the taxa, all animals are in Kingdom
Animalia. All plants are in Kingdom Plantae. Phyla are slightly less
broad. There are usually a few phyla in each kingdom. Species is the most
restricted. 
 The easiest way to remember the different levels (I can guarantee
you'll see this on one or more tests): King Philip
Came Over For Good Soup 
 King = Kingdom, Philip = Phylum, Came = Class, Over = Order, For =
Family, Good = Genus, Soup = Species. 
 
 
 Dichotomous keys, phenograms, phylogenies and other
words you'll learn all too well 
 
 
 
 THIS IS A BIG PART OF THIS COURSE, SO MAKE SURE YOU
KNOW THIS STUFF COLD! IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY APPEAR ON EVERY EXAM AND
THE LAB PRACTICAL 
 
 

 
 
 
  Dichotomous Keys 
 
   
 
 
 
  Dichotomous keys will typically be either a diagram or a table.
The diagrammatic format will typically look like the picture shown at
the
right 
  It is important to note that dichotmous keys have NOTHING to
do with
biology alone. They are simply a tool. You can make a dichotmous key to
describe ANYTHING. 
  Dichotomous keys are fairly simple to make up IF you
understand what
they're all about. They go step by step - each splitting of a branch
tells
you which things have what characteristics. 
 
 
 
 


 Key To Things In My Room 

 1 - Things on My Desk 
 2 - Electronic Equipment - my computer 
 2' - Non-electronic Equipment - a book 
 1' - Things on My Bed 
 2 - Things That Belong on a Bed 
 3 - Things For Your Head -
pillow 		
    3' - Things For Your Body -
blanket    
 2' - Things That Don't Belong on a Bed 
 3 - My Ashtray 
 
 
 Phenograms 
 Phenograms are very easy - group the things that look alike. Tigers
look more like lions than ants so you arrange them closer to the lion than
to the ant. You won't see too many phenograms because there are flaws to
them. As you will learn later, even though they look nothing like
chordates, echinoderms are the chordate's closest relative. A typical 
phenogram is shown below. When phenograms are accurate, they are usually
the best way of showing evolutionary relationships. They can typically
lead you in the right direction, but ideally they should be corroborated
by other methods. 
 
 
 
 
 Phylogenies 
 Phylogenies are what you will undoubtedly see the most of. A phylogeny
(phylo- = "arranged" or "ordered"/ -geny = "birth" or "start") arranges
organisms by where they developed from. Phylogenies are the family tree of
a group of animals. Typically, you will see questions that give you 4 or 5
organisms to arrange. More often than not, two of them will be similar and
the others will be distantly related. A past exam question: 
 
 "Draw a likely phylogeny of [a whale, a bat, a starfish, a pine tree,
a crab]" - It should look like this: 
  
 It is set up this way because whales and bats are both mammals.
Starfish is next because it is an echinoderm and most closely related to
the invertebrates. The crab comes next because arthropods are closer to
the echinoderms than conifers (a group that includes pine trees) are.
Generally, the easiest way to actually make a phylogeny is to take the 
organisms that belong in the same category (ie mammals with mammals)
and then branch off to the more distantly related organisms. Practice
making phylogenies. If you can consistently make phylogenies, you're just
adding up the points because you will see them again and again.
They're free points.

 (2) An individual belonging to a group of organisms (or the entire group itself) having common characteristics and (usually) are capable of mating with one another to produce fertile offspring. Failing that (for example the Liger) It has to be ecologically and recognisably the same. 
 
 Supplement 
 A species is given a two-part name: the generic name and the specific name (or specific epithet). For example, Allium cepa (commonly known as onion )

Evolution 101: Speciation        Home &gt;   Evolution 101     	 	 	    	        	       	 	 	                      	           	 	  Defining a Species 	  	   Biological species concept 	  Other species concepts 	  	 	    	 Biological Species Concept 	 The biological species concept defines a species as members of populations	 that actually or potentially interbreed in nature, not according to	 similarity of appearance. Although appearance is		helpful in identifying species, it does not define species.   Appearance isn&#146;t everything    		 Organisms may appear to be alike and be different species. For example, Western meadowlarks ( Sturnella neglecta ) and Eastern meadowlarks ( Sturnella magna ) look almost identical to one another, yet do not interbreed with each other&#151;thus, they are separate species according to this definition. 	 		 		 			 			 			 		 		 			 The Western meadowlark (left) and the Eastern meadowlark (right) appear to be identical, and their ranges overlap, but their distinct songs prevent interbreeding. 		 	     Organisms may look different and yet be the same species. For example, look at these ants. You might think that they are distantly related species. In fact, they are sisters&#151;two ants of the species Pheidole barbata , fulfilling different roles in the same colony.        Many characteristics can vary within a single species. For example,    the plant hydrangea may have pink		  &#147;flowers&#148;&#151;they&#146;re actually modified leaves&#151;or		  blue &#147;flowers.&#148; But			 that doesn&#146;t mean that we should classify			 the two forms as different species. In fact, you could cause a			 blue-&#147;flowered&#148; plant to become a			 pink-&#147;flowered&#148; plant just by changing the pH of the soil and			 the amount of aluminum taken up by the plant.    Adding to the problem 		 We already pointed out two of the difficulties with the biological species concept: what do you do with asexual organisms, and what do you do with organisms that occasionally form hybrids with one another? Other difficulties include:    What is meant by &#147;potentially interbreeding?&#148; If a population   of frogs were divided by a freeway, as shown below, that prevented   the two groups of frogs from interbreeding, should we designate   them as separate species? Probably not&#151;but how distantly separated do they		 have to be before we draw the line?           Ring species are species with a geographic distribution   that forms a ring and overlaps at the ends. The many subspecies   of Ensatina salamanders in California exhibit subtle morphological   and genetic differences all along their range. They all interbreed   with their immediate neighbors with one exception: where the   extreme ends of the range overlap in Southern California, E. klauberi 			and E. eschscholtzii do not interbreed. So where do we mark the point			of speciation?			 			     Chronospecies are different stages in the same evolving lineage that		 existed at different points in time. Obviously, chronospecies present a problem			for the biological species concept&#151;for example, it is not really			possible (or very meaningful!) to figure out whether a trilobite living 300 million			years ago would have interbred with its ancestor living 310 million years ago.			 This trilobite lineage below evolved gradually over time:          Should we consider trilobite A as a separate species			from trilobite D, and if so, where should we divide the lineage into separate species? 			   	 	  	 	 	  	 Other species concepts 	     	 	  	 	 	  	 Lesson plans for teaching about species 	   	 	&#149; Western meadowlark photo by John and Karen Hollingsworth courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 	&#149; Eastern meadowlark photo courtesy of Ron Austing 	&#149; Ant photo courtesy of Alex Wild    	       	 	    Defining Speciation           Search &#183; Site Index &#183; Navigation &#183; Copyright &#183; Credits &#183; Contact   Understanding Evolution For Teachers Home &#183; Understanding Evolution Home   Read how others have recognized the Understanding Evolution website    Spanish translation of Understanding Evolution For Teachers from the Spanish Society of Evolutionary Biology.

			 Undergraduate Program 
   
   Physiological Science provides a rich background that covers cellular
			through whole organism physiology, and is appropriate for a variety of
			professions. Many of our students consider themselves "Pre-Med" which means
			that they are satisfying requirements for entering Medical School upon
			graduation, or in the near future. Others seek rewarding careers in
			research, teaching, physical therapy, nursing, optometry and pharmacy, just
			to name a few options. 
			
			 In addition to enjoying a strong curriculum in science, students in the
			major have diverse interests. Their activities include taking on a minor or
			choosing to double major, as well as participating in student government,
			volunteer work, academic and honor societies, a sorority or fraternity, and
			athletics. Whatever you do, take advantage of your undergraduate experience
			and participate in it as fully as possible because you only get one chance
			to be in this space at this time with this amount of liberty to explore.
			Take classes that you have always wanted to take in addition to the
			requirements, and enjoy your years here at UCLA.

  Fossil remains found by a George Washington University biologist in northwestern China have been identified as a new species of small theropod, or meat-eating, dinosaur. The discovery was made by James Clark, the Ronald B. Weintraub Professor of Biology, in the Department of Biological Sciences of GW's Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Clark, along with his then doctoral student Jonah Choiniere and a team of international researchers, found the dinosaur specimen in a remote region of Xinjiang in China in 2006. 
 In a research paper published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology , Drs. Clark and Choiniere explain recovering the skull, mandible and partial skeleton of the dinosaur. The new theropod was an estimated 1 meter or just over 3 feet long and probably weighed about 3 pounds. 
 &quot;All that was exposed on the surface was a bit of the leg,&quot; said Dr. Clark. &quot;We were pleasantly surprised to find a skull buried in the rock too.&quot; 
 The dinosaur is named Aorun zhaoi, after the Dragon King in the Chinese epic tale Journey to the West. It wasn't necessarily a small dinosaur species, though, because Aorun was still a youngster when it became a fossil. 
 &quot;We were able to look at microscopic details of Aorun's bones and they showed that the animal was less than a year old when it died on the banks of a stream,&quot; said Dr. Choiniere. 
 Dr. Choiniere, now a senior researcher at the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, was a doctoral student in Biological Studies at GW when the discovery was made. He was also a Kalbfleisch Fellow and Gerstner Scholar at the American Museum of Natural History. 
 Aorun lived more than 161 million years ago, in the earliest part of the Late Jurassic Period. Its small, numerous teeth suggest that it would have eaten prey like lizards and small relatives of today's mammals and crocodilians. 
 This is the fifth new theropod discovered at the Wucaiwan locality by the team, co-led by Dr. Clark and Dr. Xu Xing of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
 This research was funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Earth Sciences and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation.

								 Inserting cDNA into a retroviral vector?.. 
								 ... cDNA of the retrovirus using RT-PCR, then insert the cDNA of the gene into the vector, and later insert that vector into dividing cells of another organism ? Theoretically, it's the retroviral cDNA that inserts itself into the host chromosomes, so maybe this would work? See entire post

         NOMENCLATURE 
             Chemical and Biochemical Nomenclature  
         The recognized authority for the names of chemical compounds is Chemical Abstracts (CAS; http://www.cas.org/ ) and its indexes. The Merck Index , 14th ed. (Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, NJ, 2006), is also an excellent source. For guidelines to the use of biochemical
         terminology, consult Biochemical Nomenclature and Related Documents (Portland Press, London, United Kingdom, 1992), available at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/bibliog/white.html , and the instructions to authors of the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics .
         
         
         Do not express molecular weight in daltons; molecular weight is a unitless ratio. Molecular mass is expressed in daltons. 
         For enzymes, use the recommended (trivial) name assigned by the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry
         (IUB) as described in Enzyme Nomenclature (Academic Press, Inc., New York, NY, 1992) and at http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ . If a nonrecommended name is used, place the proper (trivial) name in parentheses at first use in the abstract and text.
         Use the EC number when one has been assigned. Authors of papers describing enzymological studies should review the standards
         of the STRENDA Commission for information required for adequate description of experimental conditions and for reporting enzyme activity data. 
         
          Nomenclature of Mice 
         For mouse strain and genetic nomenclature, ASM encourages authors to refer to the guidelines set forth by the International
         Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, available on the Mouse Genome Database home page at http://www.informatics.jax.org/ and in Genetic Variants and Strains of the Laboratory Mouse , 3rd ed. (M. F. Lyon et al., ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, 1996). 
         
          Nomenclature of Microorganisms 
         Binary names, consisting of a generic name and a specific epithet (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae ), must be used for all microorganisms. Names of categories at or above the genus level may be used alone, but specific and
         subspecific epithets may not. A specific epithet must be preceded by a generic name, written out in full the first time it
         is used in a paper. Thereafter, the generic name should be abbreviated to the initial capital letter (e.g., S. cerevisiae ), provided there can be no confusion with other genera used in the paper. Names of all taxa (kingdoms, phyla, classes, orders,
         families, genera, species, and subspecies) are printed in italics and should be italicized in the manuscript; strain designations
         and numbers are not.
         
         
         The spelling of bacterial names should follow the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names (Amended) &amp; Index of the Bacterial and Yeast Nomenclatural Changes (V. B. D. Skerman et al., ed., American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC, 1989) and the validation lists and notification
         lists published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (formerly the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology ) since January 1989. In addition, two sites on the World Wide Web list current approved bacterial names: Bacterial Nomenclature
         Up-to-Date ( http://www.dsmz.de/bacterial-diversity/bacterial-nomenclature-up-to-date.html ) and List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature ( http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/ ).
         
         
         Since the classification of fungi is far from complete, it is the responsibility of the author to determine the accepted binomial
         for a given organism. Sources for these names include The Yeasts: a Taxonomic Study , 5th ed. (C. P. Kurtzman, J. W. Fell, and T. Boekhout, ed., Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2011), and Dictionary of the Fungi , 10th ed. (P. M. Kirk, P. F. Cannon, D. W. Minter, and J. A. Stalpers, ed., CABI International, Wallingford, Oxfordshire,
         United Kingdom,
         2008); see also http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/Fundic.asp .
         
         
         Names used for viruses should be those approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and reported
         on the ICTV Virus Taxonomy website . In addition, the recommendations of the ICTV regarding the use of species names should generally be followed: when the entire
         species is discussed as a taxonomic entity, the species name, as with other taxa, is italic and has the first letter and any
         proper nouns capitalized (e.g., Tobacco mosaic virus , Murray Valley encephalitis virus ). When the behavior or manipulation of individual viruses is discussed, the vernacular (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus, Murray
         Valley encephalitis virus) should be used. If desired, synonyms may be added parenthetically when the name is first mentioned.
         Approved generic (or group) and family names may also be used.
         
         
         Microbial strains, viruses, and plasmids should be given individual designations consisting of letters and serial numbers.
         It is generally advisable to include a worker's initials or a descriptive symbol of locale or laboratory, etc., in the designation.
         Each new strain, mutant, isolate, or derivative should be given a new (serial) designation. This designation should be distinct
         from those of the genotype and phenotype, and genotypic and phenotypic symbols should not be included. 
         
          Genetic Nomenclature 
         To facilitate accurate communication, it is important that standard genetic nomenclature be used whenever possible and that deviations or proposals for new naming
          systems be endorsed by an appropriate authoritative body. Review and/or publication of submitted manuscripts that contain new or nonstandard nomenclature may be delayed by the editor
         or the Journals Department so that they may be reviewed.
         
         
         Eukaryotes . The nomenclature used for the genetics of lower eukaryotic microorganisms has not been as well formalized as that for bacteria
          and bacteriophages. Generally, authors should conform to current practices in identifying mutants and their genotypes. For
          organisms not mentioned below, it is advisable to consult the Handbook of Microbiology , 2nd ed. (A. I. Laskin and H. A. Lechevalier, ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1988) or the Handbook of Genetics , vol. 1, Bacteria, Bacteriophages, and Fungi (R. C. King, ed., Plenum Publishing Corp., New York, NY, 1974). 
         Gene names may begin with prefixes to indicate the genus and species from which the gene is derived only when needed for clarity
         when discussing genes with the same name from two different organisms (e.g., Sc URA3 versus Ca URA3 ); the prefixes are not considered part of the gene name proper and are not italicized.
         
         
         The genetic nomenclature of Dictyostelium is summarized in the Trends in Genetics "Genetic Nomenclature Guide" (p. S.5-S.6; Elsevier Science Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom, 1998; out of print). The most
         recent modifications can be found at http://dictybase.org/ .
         
         
         For Saccharomyces cerevisiae , a gene name should always be indicated in italics and, for the wild-type locus (or dominant alleles), capital letters (e.g.,
          URA3 ). Loss-of-function (hypomorphic) or altered-function (neomorphic) alleles of the same locus should always be indicated in
         italics and lowercase letters (e.g., ura3 ). The product of a gene (i.e., a protein) should be indicated in roman type with an initial capital letter (e.g., Ura3).
         There is generally no need to add the suffix "p" to the symbol for a protein; however, in rare instances where it may be deemed
         necessary to indicate unambiguously that the symbol refers to a protein, the "p" suffix may be added (e.g., Ura3p). For the
         most recent information on S. cerevisiae gene names, consult the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) at http://www.yeastgenome.org/ . Details on the format of S. cerevisiae locus and allele designations are provided in the SGD and are also described by Cherry (Trends Genet. March: 11-12, 1995) (available for download as a PDF file at SGD, http://www.yeastgenome.org/sgdpub/Saccharomyces_cerevisiae.pdf ). Authors should use standard S. cerevisiae gene names, as listed in the SGD, in their submitted manuscripts and register new gene names with the SGD no later than the
          modification stage. 
         The most recent information for Neurospora crassa can be found in The Neurospora Compendium: Chromosomal Loci (D. R. Perkins et al., Academic Press, San Diego, CA, 2001). When naming genes for Aspergillus species, the nomenclature guidelines posted at http://www.aspergillus.org.uk/indexhome.htm?secure/sequence_info/nomenclature.htm~main should be followed, and the Aspergillus Genome Database ( http://www.aspgd.org ) should be searched to ensure that any new name is not already in use. The 1998 Trends in Genetics "Genetic Nomenclature Guide" (Elsevier Science Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom; out of print) contains nomenclature guidelines
         for several eukaryotic microbes: Schizosaccharomyces pombe (p. S.7-S.9), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (p. S.18-S.19), Neurospora crassa (p. S.14-S.15), and Aspergillus nidulans (p. S.12-S.13). In addition, for S. pombe , the websites http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/SP_Name_FAQ.shtml and http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~forsburg/plasmids.html may be helpful, and for C. reinhardtii , use http://www.chlamy.org/nomenclature.html .
         
         
         For Trypanosoma and Leishmania , consult the article by Clayton et al. (Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 97: 221-224, 1998).
         
         
         FlyBase ( http://flybase.org/ ) is the genetic nomenclature authority for Drosophila melanogaster . WormBase ( http://wormbase.org/ ) is the genetic nomenclature authority for Caenorhabditis elegans .
         
         
         For the most recent information on Candida albicans , consult the Candida Genome Database (CGD) at http://www.candidagenome.org . Details on the format of C. albicans gene nomenclature are described at http://www.candidagenome.org/Nomenclature.shtml . Authors should use standard C. albicans gene names, as listed in the CGD, in their submitted manuscripts and should register new gene names with the CGD no later
          than the modification stage .
         
         
         Prokaryotes . The genetic properties of prokaryotes are described in terms of phenotypes and genotypes. The phenotype describes the observable
         properties of an organism. The genotype refers to the genetic constitution of an organism, usually in reference to some standard
         wild type. Use the recommendations of Demerec et al. ( Genetics 54: 61-76, 1966 ) as a guide to the use of these terms. If your manuscript contains genetic nomenclature, please refer to the Instructions
         to Authors of the Journal of Bacteriology .
         
         
         Viruses . In most cases, viruses have no phenotype, since they have no metabolism outside host cells. Therefore, distinctions between
         phenotype and genotype are not made. Superscripts are used to indicate hybrid genomes. Genetic symbols may be one, two, or
         three letters. For example, a mutant strain of lambda may be designated c I857 int 2 red 114 A am11; this strain carries mutations in genes c I, int , and red and an amber-suppressible (am) mutation in gene A . Host DNA insertions into viruses should be delineated by square brackets, and the genetic symbols and designations for such
         inserted DNA should conform to those used for the host genome.
         
         
         Conventions for naming genes . It is recommended that (entirely) new genes be given names that are mnemonics of their function, avoiding names that are
         already assigned and earlier or alternative gene names, irrespective of the organism for which such assignments have been
         made. Similarly, it is recommended that, whenever possible, orthologous genes present in different organisms receive the same
         name. When homology is not apparent or the function of a new gene has not been established, the GenBank locus tag may be used
         to designate the gene; it should not be italicized.
         
         
         Locus tags . Locus tags are systematic, unique identifiers that are assigned to each gene in GenBank. All genes mentioned in a manuscript
         should be traceable to their sequences by the reader, and locus tags may be used for this purpose in manuscripts to identify
         uncharacterized genes. Authors should check GenBank to make sure that they are using the correct, up-to-date format for locus
         tags (e.g., uppercase versus lowercase letters and the presence or absence of an underscore, etc.). Locus tag formats vary
         between different organisms and also may be updated for a given organism, so it is important to check GenBank at the time
         of manuscript preparation.
         
         
         " Homology " versus " similarity ." For use of terms that describe relationships between genes, consult the articles by Theissen (Nature 415: 741, 2002) and Fitch (Trends Genet. 16: 227-231, 2000). "Homology" implies a relationship between genes that have a common evolutionary origin; partial homology is
         not recognized. When sequence comparisons are discussed, it is more appropriate to use the term "percent sequence similarity"
         or "percent sequence identity," as appropriate.
         
         
         " Mutant " versus " mutation ." Keep in mind the distinction between a mutation (an alteration of the primary sequence of the genetic material) and a mutant
         (a strain carrying one or more mutations). One may speak about the mapping of a mutation, but one cannot map a mutant. Likewise,
         a mutant has no genetic locus, only a phenotype.
         
         
         Transposable elements, plasmids, and restriction enzymes . Nomenclature of transposable elements (insertion sequences, transposons, and phage Mu, etc.) should follow the recommendations
         of Campbell et al. (Gene 5: 197-206, 1979), with the modifications referred to in the Instructions to Authors in the Journal of Bacteriology .
         
         
         The system of designating transposon insertions at sites where there are no known loci, e.g., zef-123 ::Tn 5 , has been described by Chumley et al. ( Genetics 91: 639-655, 1979 ). Use the nomenclature recommendations of Novick et al. (Bacteriol. Rev. 40: 168-189, 1976) for plasmids and plasmid-specified activities, of Low (Bacteriol. Rev. 36: 587-607, 1972) for F' factors, and of Roberts et al. ( Nucleic Acids Res. 31: 1805-1812, 2003 ) for restriction enzymes, DNA methyltransferases, homing endonucleases, and their genes. The nomenclature for recombinant
         DNA molecules constructed in vitro follows the nomenclature for insertions in general. DNA inserted into recombinant DNA molecules should be described by using
         the gene symbols and conventions for the organism from which the DNA was obtained.

 Essential fatty acids , or EFAs , are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them. [ 1 ] The term "essential fatty acid" refers to fatty acids required for biological processes but does not include the fats that only act as fuel. 
 Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid ). [ 2 ]  [ 3 ] Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as "conditionally essential," meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions; examples include docosahexaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). 
 When the two EFAs were discovered in 1923, they were designated "vitamin F", but in 1930, research on rats showed that the two EFAs are better classified as fats rather than vitamins . [ 3 ]

 [ edit ] Functions 
 
 The biological effects of the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are mediated by their mutual interactions, see Essential fatty acid interactions for detail. 
 
 In the body, essential fatty acids serve multiple functions. In each of these, the balance between dietary ω-3 and ω-6 strongly affects function. 
 
 They are modified to make
 
 the classic eicosanoids (affecting inflammation and many other cellular functions) 
 the endocannabinoids (affecting mood, behavior and inflammation) 
 the lipoxins which are a group of eicosanoid derivatives formed via the lipoxygenase pathway from ω-6 EFAs and resolvins from ω-3 (in the presence of aspirin, downregulating inflammation) 
 the isofurans , neurofurans , isoprostanes , hepoxilins , epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and Neuroprotectin D 
 
 
 They form lipid rafts (affecting cellular signaling) [ 4 ] 
 They act on DNA (activating or inhibiting transcription factors such as NF-κB , which is linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine production) [ 5 ] 
 
 
 [ edit ] Nomenclature and terminology 
 
 Fatty acids are straight chain hydrocarbons possessing a carboxyl (COOH) group at one end. The carbon next to the carboxylate is known as α, the next carbon β, and so forth. Since biological fatty acids can be of different lengths, the last position is labelled as a "ω", the last letter in the Greek alphabet . Since the physiological properties of unsaturated fatty acids largely depend on the position of the first unsaturation relative to the end position and not the carboxylate, the position is signified by (ω minus n). For example, the term ω-3 signifies that the first double bond exists as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal CH 3 end (ω) of the carbon chain. The number of carbons and the number of double bonds is also listed. 
 ω-3 18:4 ( stearidonic acid ) or 18:4 ω-3 or 18:4 n−3 indicates an 18-carbon chain with 4 double bonds, and with the first double bond in the third position from the CH 3 end. Double bonds are cis and separated by a single methylene (CH 2 ) group unless otherwise noted. So in free fatty acid form, the chemical structure of stearidonic acid is: 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] Examples 
 
 For complete tables of ω-3 and ω-6 essential fatty acids, see Polyunsaturated fatty acids . 
 
 The essential fatty acids start with the short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SC-PUFA) : 
 
 ω-3 fatty acids :
 
 α-Linolenic acid or ALA (18:3) 
 
 
 ω-6 fatty acids :
 
 Linoleic acid or LA (18:2) 
 
 
 
 These two fatty acids cannot be synthesized by humans because humans lack the desaturase enzymes required for their production. 
 They form the starting point for the creation of longer and more desaturated fatty acids, which are also referred to as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA): 
 
 ω-3 fatty acids :
 
 eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (20:5) 
 docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (22:6) 
 
 
 ω-6 fatty acids :
 
 gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (18:3) 
 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid or DGLA (20:3) 
 arachidonic acid or AA (20:4) 
 
 
 
 ω-9 fatty acids are not essential in humans, because humans generally possess all the enzymes required for their synthesis. 
 [ edit ] Essential fatty acids 
 Mammals lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbon 9 and 10, hence ω-6 linoleic acid (18:2,9,12), abbreviated LA, and the ω-3 linolenic acid (18:3,9,12,15), abbreviated ALA, are essential for humans in the diet. In humans, arachidonic acid (20:4,5,8,11,14) can be synthesized from LA by desaturation and chain elongation (though some carnivores like cats cannot do this, and require arachadonate in the diet). In addition, the human body can make some long-chain ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) from the ω-3 ALA. 
 Between 1930 and 1950, arachidonic acid and linolenic acid were termed 'essential' because each was more or less able to meet the growth requirements of rats given fat-free diets. Further research has shown that human metabolism requires both ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids. To some extent, any ω-3 and any ω-6 can relieve the worst symptoms of fatty acid deficiency for its class. Particular fatty acids are still needed at critical life stages (e.g. lactation) and in some disease states. In nonscientific writing, common usage is that the term essential fatty acid comprises all the ω-3 or -6 fatty acids. Conjugated fatty acids like calendic acid are not normally considered essential. Authoritative sources include the whole families, without qualification. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] 
 Traditionally speaking, the LC-PUFAs are not essential. Because the LC-PUFA are sometimes required, they may be considered "conditionally essential", or not essential to healthy adults. [ 9 ] 
 Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils , which are "essential" in the sense of being a concentrated essence . 
 
 [ edit ] Food sources 
 
 Some of the food sources of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are fish and shellfish , flaxseed (linseed) , hemp oil , soya oil , canola (rapeseed) oil , chia seeds , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , leafy vegetables , and walnuts . 
 Essential fatty acids play a part in many metabolic processes , and there is evidence to suggest that low levels of essential fatty acids, or the wrong balance of types among the essential fatty acids, may be a factor in a number of illnesses, including osteoporosis . [ 10 ] 
 Plant sources of ω-3 contain neither eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) nor docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The human body can (and in case of a purely vegetarian diet often must, unless certain algae or supplements derived from them are consumed) convert α-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and subsequently DHA. This however requires more metabolic work, which is thought to be the reason that the absorption of essential fatty acids is much greater from animal rather than plant sources (see Fish and plants as a source of Omega-3 for more). 
 The IUPAC Lipid Handbook provides a very large and detailed listing of fat contents of animal and vegetable fats, including ω-3 and -6 oils. [ 11 ] The National Institutes of Health 's EFA Education group publishes Essential Fats in Food Oils . [ 12 ] This lists 40 common oils, more tightly focused on EFAs and sorted by n-6:3 ratio. Vegetable Lipids as Components of Functional Food lists notable vegetable sources of EFAs as well as commentary and an overview of the biosynthetic pathways involved. [ 13 ] Users can interactively search at NutritionData.com for the richest food sources of particular EFAs or other nutrients. [ 14 ] Careful readers will note that these sources are not in excellent agreement. EFA content of vegetable sources varies with cultivation conditions. Animal sources vary widely, both with the animal's feed and that the EFA makeup varies markedly with fats from different body parts. 
 [ edit ] Human health 
 Main article: Diet and heart disease 
 Almost all the polyunsaturated fats in the human diet are EFAs. Essential fatty acids play an important role in the life and death of cardiac cells. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ]  [ 17 ]  [ 18 ] 
 [ edit ] Essential fatty acid deficiency 
 Essential fatty acid deficiency results in a dermatitis similar to that seen in zinc or biotin deficiency . [ 19 ] :485 
 Biologist Ray Peat has argued that there are flaws in the studies (such as the Burr experiment) showing the need for ω-3 and ω-6 fats, and that symptoms of so-called EFA deficiencies have been reversed by adding B vitamins or a fat-free liver extract to the diet. In his view, "the optional dietary level of the 'essential fatty acids' might be close to zero, if other dietary factors were also optimized." [ 20 ] These views are contrary to the scientific consensus. 
 [ edit ] Treatment for depression 
 Research suggests that high intakes of fish and omega-3 fatty acids are linked to decreased rates of major depression. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are important for enzymatic pathways required to metabolize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Low plasma concentrations of DHA predict low concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). It is found that low concentrations of 5-HIAA in the brain is associated with depression and suicide. [ 21 ] 
 There are high concentrations of DHA in synaptic membranes of the brain. This is critical for synaptic transmission and membrane fluidity . The omega-6 fatty acid to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is important to avoid imbalance of membrane fluidity. Membrane fluidity affects function of enzymes such as adenylate cyclase and ion channels such as calcium , potassium , and sodium , which in turn affects receptor numbers and functioning, as well as serotonin neurotransmitter levels. It is evident that western diets are deficient in omega-3 and excessive in omega-6, and balancing of this ratio would confer numerous health benefits. [ 22 ] 
 Clinical research suggests a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression during the perinatal period. [ 21 ] A meta analysis of trials of EPA supplements for depression in non-pregnant adults concluded that supplments with more than 60% EPA are effective, but those containing primarily DHA, or less than 60% EPA, were not effective.

Authoritative sources include the whole families, without qualification. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] 
 Traditionally speaking, the LC-PUFAs are not essential. Because the LC-PUFA are sometimes required, they may be considered "conditionally essential", or not essential to healthy adults. [ 9 ] 
 Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils , which are "essential" in the sense of being a concentrated essence . 
 
 [ edit ] Food sources 
 
 Some of the food sources of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are fish and shellfish , flaxseed (linseed) , hemp oil , soya oil , canola (rapeseed) oil , chia seeds , pumpkin seeds , sunflower seeds , leafy vegetables , and walnuts . 
 Essential fatty acids play a part in many metabolic processes , and there is evidence to suggest that low levels of essential fatty acids, or the wrong balance of types among the essential fatty acids, may be a factor in a number of illnesses, including osteoporosis . [ 10 ] 
 Plant sources of ω-3 contain neither eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) nor docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The human body can (and in case of a purely vegetarian diet often must, unless certain algae or supplements derived from them are consumed) convert α-linolenic acid (ALA) to EPA and subsequently DHA. This however requires more metabolic work, which is thought to be the reason that the absorption of essential fatty acids is much greater from animal rather than plant sources (see Fish and plants as a source of Omega-3 for more).

 [ edit ] Treatment for depression 
 Research suggests that high intakes of fish and omega-3 fatty acids are linked to decreased rates of major depression. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are important for enzymatic pathways required to metabolize long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Low plasma concentrations of DHA predict low concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). It is found that low concentrations of 5-HIAA in the brain is associated with depression and suicide. [ 21 ] 
 There are high concentrations of DHA in synaptic membranes of the brain. This is critical for synaptic transmission and membrane fluidity . The omega-6 fatty acid to omega-3 fatty acid ratio is important to avoid imbalance of membrane fluidity. Membrane fluidity affects function of enzymes such as adenylate cyclase and ion channels such as calcium , potassium , and sodium , which in turn affects receptor numbers and functioning, as well as serotonin neurotransmitter levels. It is evident that western diets are deficient in omega-3 and excessive in omega-6, and balancing of this ratio would confer numerous health benefits. [ 22 ] 
 Clinical research suggests a benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression during the perinatal period. [ 21 ] A meta analysis of trials of EPA supplements for depression in non-pregnant adults concluded that supplments with more than 60% EPA are effective, but those containing primarily DHA, or less than 60% EPA, were not effective.

 Essential fatty acids , or EFAs , are fatty acids that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot synthesize them. [ 1 ] The term "essential fatty acid" refers to fatty acids required for biological processes but does not include the fats that only act as fuel. 
 Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid ) and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid ). [ 2 ]  [ 3 ] Some other fatty acids are sometimes classified as "conditionally essential," meaning that they can become essential under some developmental or disease conditions; examples include docosahexaenoic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) and gamma-linolenic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid). 
 When the two EFAs were discovered in 1923, they were designated "vitamin F", but in 1930, research on rats showed that the two EFAs are better classified as fats rather than vitamins . [ 3 ]

 [ edit ] Functions 
 
 The biological effects of the ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids are mediated by their mutual interactions, see Essential fatty acid interactions for detail. 
 
 In the body, essential fatty acids serve multiple functions. In each of these, the balance between dietary ω-3 and ω-6 strongly affects function. 
 
 They are modified to make
 
 the classic eicosanoids (affecting inflammation and many other cellular functions) 
 the endocannabinoids (affecting mood, behavior and inflammation) 
 the lipoxins which are a group of eicosanoid derivatives formed via the lipoxygenase pathway from ω-6 EFAs and resolvins from ω-3 (in the presence of aspirin, downregulating inflammation) 
 the isofurans , neurofurans , isoprostanes , hepoxilins , epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and Neuroprotectin D 
 
 
 They form lipid rafts (affecting cellular signaling) [ 4 ] 
 They act on DNA (activating or inhibiting transcription factors such as NF-κB , which is linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine production) [ 5 ] 
 
 
 [ edit ] Nomenclature and terminology 
 
 Fatty acids are straight chain hydrocarbons possessing a carboxyl (COOH) group at one end. The carbon next to the carboxylate is known as α, the next carbon β, and so forth. Since biological fatty acids can be of different lengths, the last position is labelled as a "ω", the last letter in the Greek alphabet . Since the physiological properties of unsaturated fatty acids largely depend on the position of the first unsaturation relative to the end position and not the carboxylate, the position is signified by (ω minus n). For example, the term ω-3 signifies that the first double bond exists as the third carbon-carbon bond from the terminal CH 3 end (ω) of the carbon chain. The number of carbons and the number of double bonds is also listed. 
 ω-3 18:4 ( stearidonic acid ) or 18:4 ω-3 or 18:4 n−3 indicates an 18-carbon chain with 4 double bonds, and with the first double bond in the third position from the CH 3 end. Double bonds are cis and separated by a single methylene (CH 2 ) group unless otherwise noted. So in free fatty acid form, the chemical structure of stearidonic acid is: 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] Examples 
 
 For complete tables of ω-3 and ω-6 essential fatty acids, see Polyunsaturated fatty acids . 
 
 The essential fatty acids start with the short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (SC-PUFA) : 
 
 ω-3 fatty acids :
 
 α-Linolenic acid or ALA (18:3) 
 
 
 ω-6 fatty acids :
 
 Linoleic acid or LA (18:2) 
 
 
 
 These two fatty acids cannot be synthesized by humans because humans lack the desaturase enzymes required for their production. 
 They form the starting point for the creation of longer and more desaturated fatty acids, which are also referred to as long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA): 
 
 ω-3 fatty acids :
 
 eicosapentaenoic acid or EPA (20:5) 
 docosahexaenoic acid or DHA (22:6) 
 
 
 ω-6 fatty acids :
 
 gamma-linolenic acid or GLA (18:3) 
 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid or DGLA (20:3) 
 arachidonic acid or AA (20:4) 
 
 
 
 ω-9 fatty acids are not essential in humans, because humans generally possess all the enzymes required for their synthesis. 
 [ edit ] Essential fatty acids 
 Mammals lack the ability to introduce double bonds in fatty acids beyond carbon 9 and 10, hence ω-6 linoleic acid (18:2,9,12), abbreviated LA, and the ω-3 linolenic acid (18:3,9,12,15), abbreviated ALA, are essential for humans in the diet. In humans, arachidonic acid (20:4,5,8,11,14) can be synthesized from LA by desaturation and chain elongation (though some carnivores like cats cannot do this, and require arachadonate in the diet). In addition, the human body can make some long-chain ω-3 PUFAs (EPA and DHA) from the ω-3 ALA. 
 Between 1930 and 1950, arachidonic acid and linolenic acid were termed 'essential' because each was more or less able to meet the growth requirements of rats given fat-free diets. Further research has shown that human metabolism requires both ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids. To some extent, any ω-3 and any ω-6 can relieve the worst symptoms of fatty acid deficiency for its class. Particular fatty acids are still needed at critical life stages (e.g. lactation) and in some disease states. In nonscientific writing, common usage is that the term essential fatty acid comprises all the ω-3 or -6 fatty acids. Conjugated fatty acids like calendic acid are not normally considered essential. Authoritative sources include the whole families, without qualification. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] 
 Traditionally speaking, the LC-PUFAs are not essential. Because the LC-PUFA are sometimes required, they may be considered "conditionally essential", or not essential to healthy adults. [ 9 ] 
 Essential fatty acids should not be confused with essential oils , which are "essential" in the sense of being a concentrated essence .

		 Biological nomenclature is used to create unambiguous references to genetic objects. Learn more about this valuable tool with this video series. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Part I: The History and Reasoning Behind Biological Nomenclature 
   
 
 
 Part II: Gene Nomenclature 
  
 
 
 Part III: QTL and Marker Nomenclature 
  
 
 
 Part IV: Rat Strain Nomenclature 
  
 
 
 
 Accurate nomenclature is becoming an increasingly indispensable tool used to disambiguate genetic objects such as genes, QTLs and strains. This video will give you background on the history of nomenclature and its importance, in order to strengthen your understanding of genetic nomenclature. 
 Standardized biological nomenclature is a valuable and ever-expanding tool that researchers can use in order to reliably retrieve data and research the genome through analysis tools, such as the ones available in RGD. Learn more about rat, mouse and human gene nomenclature, particularly how it is assigned and where you can go to seek help when naming your genes. 
 Proper use of nomenclature is an indispensable tool in the disambiguation of genetic objects and their data. This informative video showcases the standardization and use of both QTL and marker nomenclature. 
 Effective nomenclature helps present data unambiguously. Learn how to use the correct biological nomenclature to name the strains that you or your research group develop with this informative tutorial.

 Nomenclature is a term that applies to either a list of names or terms, or to refer to something that is a term or to the system of principles , procedures and terms related to naming —which is the assigning of a word or phrase to a particular object, event, or property. [ 1 ] The principles of naming vary from the relatively informal conventions of everyday speech to the internationally-agreed principles, rules and recommendations that govern the formation and use of the specialist terms used in scientific and other disciplines. 
 Naming "things" is a part of our general communication using words and language : it is an aspect of everyday taxonomy as we distinguish the objects of our experience, together with their similarities and differences, which we identify , name and classify . The use of names, as the many different kinds of nouns embedded in different languages, connects nomenclature to theoretical linguistics , while the way we mentally structure the world in relation to word meanings and experience relates to the philosophy of language . 
 Onomastics , the study of proper names and their origins, includes: anthroponymy , concerned with human names, including personal names , surnames and nicknames ; toponymy the study of place names; and etymology , the derivation, history and use of names as revealed through comparative and descriptive linguistics . 
 The scientific need for simple, stable and internationally-accepted systems for naming objects of the natural world has generated many formal nomenclatural systems. Probably the best known of these nomenclatural systems are the five codes of biological nomenclature that govern the Latinized scientific names of organisms .

 [ edit ] Definition &amp; criteria 
 Nomenclature is a system of words used in particular discipline. It is used in respect of giving names systematically following the rules to all known living. It is applied to many chemical components, mainly used in carbon and hydrogen components. 
 [ edit ] Etymology 
 The word nomenclature is derived from the Latin nomen - name , calare - to call; the Ancient Greek ονοματοκλήτωρ from όνομα or onoma meaning name and equivalent to the Old English nama and Old High German namo which is derived from Sanskrit nama . The Latin term nomenclatura refers to a list of names as does the word nomenclator which can also indicate a provider or announcer of names. 
 [ edit ] Onomastics and nomenclature 
 Main article: Onomastics 
 The study of proper names is known as onomastics , [ 2 ] which has a wide-ranging scope encompassing all names, all languages, all geographical and cultural regions. The distinction between onomastics and nomenclature is not readily clear: onomastics is an unfamiliar discipline to most people and the use of nomenclature in an academic sense is also not commonly known. Although the two fields integrate, nomenclature concerns itself more with the rules and conventions that are used for the formation of names. [ citation needed ] 
 [ edit ] Naming as a cultural activity 
 Main article: Philosophy of language 
 Names provide us with a way of structuring and mapping the world in our minds so, in some way, they mirror or represent the objects of our experience. 
 [ edit ] Names, words, language and meaning 
 Main articles: Proper name (philosophy) and Semantics 
 Elucidating the connections between language (especially names and nouns), meaning and the way we perceive the world has provided a rich field of study for philosophers and linguists . Relevant areas of study include: the distinction between proper names and proper nouns; [ 3 ] and the relationship between names, [ 4 ] their referents, [ 5 ] meanings ( semantics ), and the structure of language. 
 [ edit ] Folk taxonomy 
 Main articles: Folk taxonomy and Binomial nomenclature 
 Modern scientific taxonomy has been described as " basically a Renaissance codification of folk taxonomic principles. " [ 6 ] Formal scientific nomenclatural and classification systems are exemplified by biological classification . All classification systems are established for a purpose. The scientific classification system anchors each organism within the nested hierarchy of internationally-accepted classification categories. Maintenance of this system involves formal rules of nomenclature and periodic international meetings of review. This modern system evolved from the folk taxonomy of pre-history. [ 7 ] Folk taxonomy can be illustrated through the Western tradition of horticulture and gardening. Unlike scientific taxonomy, folk taxonomies serve many purposes. Examples in horticulture would be the grouping of plants, and naming of these groups, according to their properties and uses: annuals , biennials and perennials (nature of life cycle); vegetables , fruits , culinary herbs and spices (culinary use); herbs , trees and shrubs (growth habit); wild and cultivated plants (whether they are managed or not), and weeds (whether they are considered to be a nuisance or not) and so on. 
 Folk taxonomy is generally associated with the way rural or indigenous peoples use language to make sense of and organise the objects around them. Ethnobiology frames this interpretation through either "utilitarianists" like Bronislaw Malinowski who maintain that names and classifications reflect mainly material concerns, and "intellectualists" like Claude Lévi-Strauss who hold that they spring from innate mental processes. [ 8 ] The literature of ethnobiological classifications was reviewed in 2006. [ 9 ] Folk classification is defined by the way in which members of a language community name and categorize plants and animals whereas ethnotaxonomy refers to the hierarchical structure, organic content, and cultural function of biological classification that ethnobiologists find in every society around the world. [ 10 ] 
 Ethnographic studies of the naming and classification of animals and plants in non-Western societies have revealed some general principles that indicate pre-scientific man’s conceptual and linguistic method of organising the biological world in a hierarchical way. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] Such studies indicate that the urge to classify is a basic human instinct. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] 
 
 
 
 in all languages natural groups of organisms are distinguished (present-day taxa) 
 these groups are arranged into more inclusive groups or ethnobiological categories 
 in all languages there are about five or six ethnobiological categories of graded inclusiveness 
 these groups (ethnobiological categories) are arranged hierarchically, generally into mutually exclusive ranks 
 the ranks at which particular organisms are named and classified is often similar in different cultures 
 
 
 
 The levels are — moving from the most to least inclusive: 
 
 
 
 level 1 - "unique beginner" --e.g. plant or animal . A single all-inclusive name rarely used in folk taxonomies but loosely equivalent to an original living thing, a "common ancestor" 
 level 2 - “life form” --------------e.g. tree , bird , grass and fish These are usually primary lexemes (basic linguistic units) loosely equivalent to a phylum or major biological division. 
 level 3 - "generic name" ------e.g. oak , pine , robin , catfish This is the most numerous and basic building block of all folk taxonomies, the most frequently referred to, the most important psychologically, and among the first learned by children. These names can usually be associated directly with a second level group. Like life-form names these are primary lexemes. 
 level 4 - "specific name" ------e.g. white fir , post oak More or less equivalent to species. A secondary lexeme and generally less frequent than generic names. 
 level 5 - "varietal name"--------e.g. baby lima bean , butter lima bean . 
 
 
 
 In almost all cultures objects are named using one or two words equivalent to "kind" (genus) and "particular kind" (species). [ 6 ] When made up of two words (a binomial ) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt , dog or star ) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more "specific", for example, lap dog , sea salt , or film star . The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten ( whelk , elm , lion , shark , pig ) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties ( sting ray , poison apple , giant stinking hogweed , hammerhead shark ). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian- or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson . It seems reasonable to assume that the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language. 
 In keeping with the "utilitarianist" view other authors maintain that ethnotaxonomies resemble more a "complex web of resemblances" than a neat hierarchy. [ 17 ] 
 [ edit ] Names and nouns 
 Main articles: Name and Noun 
 A name is a label for any noun . Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context . Names are given, for example, to humans or any other organisms , places , products - as in brand names - and even to ideas or concepts . It is names as nouns that are the building blocks of nomenclature. 
 The word "name" is possibly derived from the Proto-Indo-European language hypothesised word nomn . [ 18 ] The distinction between names and nouns, if made at all, is extremely subtle [ 19 ] although clearly “noun” refers to names as lexical categories and their function within the context of language, [ 20 ] rather that as “labels” for objects and properties. 
 [ edit ] Personal names 
 Main articles: Anthroponymy and Personal name 
 Human personal names are presented, used and categorised in many ways depending on the language and culture. It is customary nowadays to use two-word names or binomials . In the Christian tradition the first name is given at baptism and referred to as the Christian name , but it is also known as the given name , forename or simply the first name . In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066 small communities of Celts , Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians all used single names, each person being identified by a single name as either a personal name or nickname . As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further – giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard … which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the second name , last name , family name , surnames or occasionally the byname , and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given name of the father) between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym and surnames rarely used. Nicknames (sometimes called hypocoristic names) are informal names used mostly between friends. 
 [ edit ] Common names and proper names 
 Main articles: Common name and Proper name 
 The distinction between proper names and common names is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. London Bridge , while common names are used in a more general sense in reference to a class of objects e.g. bridge . Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning in the way that ordinary words mean probably for the practical reason that when they consist of Collective nouns refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the singular e.g. "committee". Concrete nouns like “cabbage” refer to physical bodies that can be observed by at least one of the senses while abstract nouns , like “love” and “hate” refer to abstract objects. In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding noun-forming suffixes ("-ness", "-ity", "-tion") to adjectives or verbs e.g. "happiness", "serenity" “concentration”. Pronouns , like "he", "it", "which", and "those" stand in place of nouns in noun phrases . 
 The capitalization of nouns varies with language and even the particular context: journals often have their own house styles for common names. 
 [ edit ] -onym nouns 
 Main article: -onym 
 Distinctions may be made between particular kinds of names simply by using the suffix -onym , from the Greek ὄνομα (ónoma) 'name'. So we have, for example, hydronyms name bodies of water, synonyms are names with the same meaning and so on. Although the entire field could be described as chrematonymy - the names of things. 
 [ edit ] Toponyms 
 Main article: Toponymy 
 Toponyms are the names given to places or features of a particular district, region, etc. [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] This could include planets, countries, cities, towns, villages, buildings etc.; it can be further divided into specialist branches: hodonymy, the names of streets, roads, and the like; hydronymy , the names of water bodies; and oronomy, the names of mountains. Toponymy has popular appeal because of its socio-cultural and historical interest and significance for cartography . However, work on the etymology of toponyms has found that many place names are descriptive, honorific or commemorative but frequently they have no meaning or the meaning is obscure or lost. Also the many categories of names are frequently interrelated. For example, many place-names are derived from personal names ( Victoria), many names of planets and stars are derived from the names of mythological characters ( Venus , Neptune ), and many personal names are derived from place-names, names of nations and the like (Wood, Smith, Bridge). [ 23 ]  [ 24 ] 
 [ edit ] Scientific nomenclature 
 [ edit ] Nomenclature, classification and identification 
 Main articles: Taxonomy (biology) and Identification (biology) 
 In biological science, at least, nomenclature is regarded as a part of (though distinct from) taxonomy. Taxonomy can be defined as the study of classification including its principles, procedures and rules, [ 25 ] while classification itself is the ordering of taxa (the objects of classification) into groups based on similarities or differences. [ 26 ]  [ 27 ] Doing taxonomy entails identifying , describing [ 28 ] and naming taxa [ 29 ] so nomenclature, in this strict scientific sense, is that branch of taxonomy concerned with the application of scientific names to taxa, based on a particular classification scheme and in accordance with agreed international rules and conventions. 
 Identification determines whether a particular taxon (singular of taxa) is identical to another one that has already been classified and named – so classification must precede identification. [ 30 ] As taxa are rarely strictly identical, but only treated as such for the purposes of the classification, this procedure is sometimes referred to as “determination". [ 31 ] 
 The precision demanded by science in the accurate naming of objects in the natural world has resulted in a variety of international nomenclatural codes, standards and protocols.

 Although Linnaeus ’ system of binomial nomenclature was rapidly adopted after the publication of his Species Plantarum and Systema Naturae in 1753 and 1758 respectively, it was a long time before there was international consensus concerning the more general rules governing biological nomenclature . The first botanical code was produced in 1905, the zoological code in 1889 and cultivated plant code in 1953. Agreement on the nomenclature and symbols for genes emerged in 1979.

 [ edit ] Astronomy 
 Main article: Astronomical naming conventions 
 Over the last few hundred years, the number of identified astronomical objects has risen from hundreds to over a billion, and more are discovered every year. Astronomers need universal systematic designations to unambiguously identify all of these objects using astronomical naming conventions , while assigning names to the most interesting objects and, where relevant, naming important or interesting features of those objects.

 Main article: IUPAC nomenclature 
 The IUPAC nomenclature is a system of naming chemical compounds and for describing the science of chemistry in general. It is maintained by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry . The rules for naming organic and inorganic compounds are printed in two publications, the Blue Book [ 34 ]  [ 35 ] and the Red Book [ 36 ] available here. A third publication, Green Book , [ 37 ] contains recommendations for the use of symbols for physical quantities (in association with the IUPAP ), while a fourth, the Gold Book , [ 38 ] defines a large number of technical terms used in chemistry. Similar compendia exist for biochemistry [ 39 ] (in association with the IUBMB ), analytical chemistry [ 40 ] and macromolecular chemistry . [ 41 ] These books are supplemented by shorter recommendations for specific circumstances which are published from time to time in the journal Pure and Applied Chemistry . These systems can be accessed here .

 [ edit ] Information technology 
 There are hundreds of different nomenclatures used in the IT industry and the list is ever expanding due to technological advances and new innovations. Some of the more common nomenclatures used are: SoC(System on Chip), BIOS(Basic Input Output System), CPU(Central Processing Unit), and etc.

 Human physiology is the science of the mechanical, physical , bioelectrical , and biochemical functions of humans in good health , their organs , and the cells of which they are composed. Physiology focuses principally at the level of organs and systems. Most aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology, and animal experimentation has provided much of the foundation of physiological knowledge. Anatomy and physiology are closely related fields of study: anatomy, the study of form, and physiology, the study of function, are intrinsically related and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.

 [ edit ] The concept of homeostasis 
 The term " homeostasis " refers to the maintenance of overall inner resistance in the body. Homeostasis stabilizes the body by regulating the internal environment. This is required for the body to function sufficiently. The Homeostatic process is essential for the survival of each cell, tissue, and body system. Homeostasis in a general sense refers to stability, balance or equilibrium. Maintaining a stable internal environment requires constant monitoring, mostly by the brain and nervous system. The brain receives information from the body and responds appropriately through the release of various substances like neurotransmitters , catecholamines , and hormones . Individual organ physiology furthermore facilitates the maintenance of homeostasis of the whole body e.g. Blood pressure regulation: the release of renin by the kidneys allow blood pressure to be stabilized (Renin, Angiotensinogen, Aldosterone System), though the brain helps regulate blood pressure by the Pituitary releasing Anti-Diuretic Hormone (ADH). Thus, homeostasis is maintained within the body as a whole, dependent upon its parts. 
 [ edit ] Systems 
 Traditionally, the academic discipline of physiology views the body as a collection of interacting systems, each with its own combination of functions and purposes. Each body system contributes to the homeostasis of other systems and of the entire organism. No system of the body works in isolation, and the well-being of the person depends upon the well-being of all the interacting body systems.

 Physiology 
 
 
  
 The nervous system consists of the central nervous system (which is the brain and spinal cord ) and peripheral nervous system . The brain is the organ of thought, emotion, memory, and sensory processing, and serves many aspects of communication and control of various other systems and functions. The special senses consist of vision , hearing , taste , and smell . The eyes , ears , tongue , and nose gather information about the body's environment.

 The musculoskeletal system consists of the human skeleton (which includes bones , ligaments , tendons , and cartilage ) and attached muscles . It gives the body basic structure and the ability for movement. In addition to their structural role, the larger bones in the body contain bone marrow , the site of production of blood cells. Also, all bones are major storage sites for calcium and phosphate . 
 osteology (skeleton), orthopedics (bone disorders) 
 cell physiology , musculoskeletal physiology 
 
 
  
 The circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels ( arteries , veins , capillaries ). The heart propels the circulation of the blood , which serves as a "transportation system" to transfer oxygen , fuel, nutrients, waste products, immune cells, and signalling molecules (i.e., hormones ) from one part of the body to another. The blood consists of fluid that carries cells in the circulation, including some that move from tissue to blood vessels and back, as well as the spleen and bone marrow . 
 cardiology (heart), hematology (blood) 
 cardiovascular physiology 
 
 
  
 The respiratory system consists of the nose , nasopharynx , trachea , and lungs . It brings oxygen from the air and excretes carbon dioxide and water back into the air. 
 pulmonology . 
 respiratory physiology 
 
 
  
 The gastrointestinal system consists of the mouth , esophagus , stomach , gut ( small and large intestines ), and rectum , as well as the liver , pancreas , gallbladder , and salivary glands . It converts food into small, nutritional, non-toxic molecules for distribution by the circulation to all tissues of the body, and excretes the unused residue.

 The integumentary system consists of the covering of the body (the skin ), including hair and nails as well as other functionally important structures such as the sweat glands and sebaceous glands . The skin provides containment, structure, and protection for other organs, but it also serves as a major sensory interface with the outside world.

 The urinary system consists of the kidneys , ureters , bladder , and urethra . It removes water from the blood to produce urine, which carries a variety of waste molecules and excess ions and water out of the body. 
 nephrology (function), urology (structural disease) 
 renal physiology 
 
 
  
 The reproductive system consists of the gonads and the internal and external sex organs . The reproductive system produces gametes in each sex , a mechanism for their combination, and a nurturing environment for the first 9 months of development of the offspring.

 reproductive physiology 
 
 
  
 The immune system consists of the white blood cells , the thymus , lymph nodes and lymph channels, which are also part of the lymphatic system . The immune system provides a mechanism for the body to distinguish its own cells and tissues from alien cells and substances and to neutralize or destroy the latter by using specialized proteins such as antibodies , cytokines , and toll-like receptors , among many others. 
 immunology 
 immunology 
 
 
  
 The endocrine system consists of the principal endocrine glands: the pituitary , thyroid , adrenals , pancreas , parathyroids , and gonads , but nearly all organs and tissues produce specific endocrine hormones as well. The endocrine hormones serve as signals from one body system to another regarding an enormous array of conditions, and resulting in variety of changes of function. There is also the exocrine system . 
 endocrinology 
 endocrinology 
 
 
 The traditional divisions by system are somewhat arbitrary. Many body parts participate in more than one system, and systems might be organized by function, by embryological origin, or other categorizations. In particular, is the " neuroendocrine system ", the complex interactions of the neurological and endocrinological systems which together regulate physiology. Furthermore, many aspects of physiology are not as easily included in the traditional organ system categories. 
 The study of how physiology is altered in disease is pathophysiology . 
 [ edit ] History 
 The study of human physiology dates back to at least 420 B.C. and the time of Hippocrates , the father of medicine. [ 1 ] The critical thinking of Aristotle and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in Ancient Greece , while Claudius Galenus (c. 126-199 A.D.), known as Galen , was the first to use experiments to probe the function of the body. Galen was the founder of experimental physiology. [ 2 ] The medical world moved on from Galenism only with the appearance of Andreas Vesalius and William Harvey . [ 3 ] 
 During the Middle Ages , the ancient Greek and Indian medical traditions were further developed by Muslim physicians . Notable work in this period was done by Avicenna (980-1037), author of the The Canon of Medicine , and Ibn al-Nafis (1213–1288), among others. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 
  
Portrait of Vesalius from his De humani corporis fabrica (1543). 
 
 
 Following from the Middle Ages, the Renaissance brought an increase of physiological research in the Western world that triggered the modern study of anatomy and physiology. Andreas Vesalius was an author of one of the most influential books on human anatomy , De humani corporis fabrica . [ 4 ] Vesalius is often referred to as the founder of modern human anatomy. [ 5 ]  Anatomist William Harvey described the circulatory system in the 17th century, [ 6 ] demonstrating the fruitful combination of close observations and careful experiments to learn about the functions of the body, which was fundamental to the development of experimental physiology. Herman Boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a father of physiology due to his exemplary teaching in Leiden and textbook Institutiones medicae (1708). [ citation needed ] 
 In the 18th century, important works in this field were by Pierre Cabanis , a French doctor and physiologist. [ citation needed ] 
 In the 19th century, physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate, in particular with the 1838 appearance of the Cell theory of Matthias Schleiden and Theodor Schwann . It radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells. Claude Bernard 's (1813–1878) further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of milieu interieur (internal environment), which would later be taken up and championed as " homeostasis " by American physiologist Walter Cannon (1871–1945). [ clarification needed ] 
 In the 20th century, biologists also became interested in how organisms other than human beings function, eventually spawning the fields of comparative physiology and ecophysiology . [ 7 ] Major figures in these fields include Knut Schmidt-Nielsen and George Bartholomew . Most recently, evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline. [ 8 ] 
 The biological basis of the study of physiology, integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body, as well as its accompanied form. It is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways, both electrical and chemical. 
 In terms of the human body, the endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function. Homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to the interactions within an organism, humans included.

volution is the cornerstone of modern biology. It unites all the
fields of biology under one theoretical umbrella. It is not a difficult
concept, but very few people -- the majority of biologists included
-- have a satisfactory grasp of it. One common mistake is believing
that species can be arranged on an evolutionary ladder from
bacteria through "lower" animals, to "higher" animals and, finally,
up to man. Mistakes permeate popular science expositions of
evolutionary biology. Mistakes even filter into biology journals and
texts. For example, Lodish, et. al., in their cell biology text,
proclaim, "It was Charles Darwin's great insight that organisms are all
related in a great chain of being..." In fact, the idea of a great
chain of being, which traces to Linnaeus, was overturned by Darwin's
idea of common descent.

 
Misunderstandings about evolution are damaging to the study of
evolution and biology as a whole. People who have a general
interest in science are likely to dismiss evolution as a soft science
after absorbing the pop science nonsense that abounds. The
impression of it being a soft science is reinforced when biologists in
unrelated fields speculate publicly about evolution.

 
This is a brief introduction to evolutionary biology. I attempt to
explain basics of the theory of evolution and correct many of the
misconceptions.

 What is Evolution? 

 
Evolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time. A
gene is a hereditary unit that can be passed on unaltered for many
generations. The gene pool is the set of all genes in a species or
population.

 
The English moth, Biston betularia , is a frequently cited example
of observed evolution. [evolution: a change in the gene pool] In this
moth there are two color morphs, light and dark. H. B. D. Kettlewell
found that dark moths constituted less than 2% of the population
prior to 1848. The frequency of the dark morph increased in the years
following. By 1898, the 95% of the moths in Manchester and other
highly industrialized areas were of the dark type. Their frequency
was less in rural areas. The moth population changed from mostly
light colored moths to mostly dark colored moths. The moths' color
was primarily determined by a single gene. [gene: a hereditary
unit] So, the change in frequency of dark colored moths
represented a change in the gene pool. [gene pool: the set all of
genes in a population] This change was, by definition, evolution.

 
The increase in relative abundance of the dark type was due to
natural selection. The late eighteen hundreds was the time of
England's industrial revolution. Soot from factories darkened the
birch trees the moths landed on. Against a sooty background, birds
could see the lighter colored moths better and ate more of them.
As a result, more dark moths survived until reproductive age and
left offspring. The greater number of offspring left by dark moths
is what caused their increase in frequency. This is an example of
natural selection.

 
Populations evolve. [evolution: a change in the gene pool] In
order to understand evolution, it is necessary to view populations
as a collection of individuals, each harboring a different set
of traits. A single organism is never typical of an entire population
unless there is no variation within that population. Individual
organisms do not evolve, they retain the same genes throughout
their life. When a population is evolving, the ratio of different
genetic types is changing -- each individual organism within
a population does not change. For example, in the previous
example, the frequency of black moths increased; the moths
did not turn from light to gray to dark in concert. The process
of evolution can be summarized in three sentences: Genes mutate.
[gene: a hereditary unit] Individuals are selected. Populations
evolve.

 
Evolution can be divided into microevolution and macroevolution.
The kind of evolution documented above is microevolution. Larger
changes, such as when a new species is formed, are called
macroevolution. Some biologists feel the mechanisms of
macroevolution are different from those of microevolutionary
change. Others think the distinction between the two is arbitrary --
macroevolution is cumulative microevolution.

 
The word evolution has a variety of meanings. The fact that all
organisms are linked via descent to a common ancestor is often
called evolution. The theory of how the first living organisms
appeared is often called evolution. This should be called abiogenesis.
And frequently, people use the word evolution when they really mean
natural selection -- one of the many mechanisms of evolution.


 Common Misconceptions about Evolution 


 
Evolution can occur without morphological change; and
morphological change can occur without evolution. Humans are
larger now than in the recent past, a result of better diet and
medicine. Phenotypic changes, like this, induced solely by
changes in environment do not count as evolution because they are
not heritable; in other words the change is not passed on to the
organism's offspring. Phenotype is the morphological, physiological,
biochemical, behavioral and other properties exhibited by a living
organism. An organism's phenotype is determined by its genes and
its environment. Most changes due to environment are fairly
subtle, for example size differences. Large scale phenotypic
changes are obviously due to genetic changes, and therefore are
evolution.

 
Evolution is not progress. Populations simply adapt to their current
surroundings. They do not necessarily become better in any absolute
sense over time. A trait or strategy that is successful at one time
may be unsuccessful at another. Paquin and Adams demonstrated this
experimentally. They founded a yeast culture and maintained it for
many generations. Occasionally, a mutation would arise that allowed
its bearer to reproduce better than its contemporaries. These mutant
strains would crowd out the formerly dominant strains. Samples of
the most successful strains from the culture were taken at a
variety of times. In later competition experiments, each strain would
outcompete the immediately previously dominant type in a culture.
However, some earlier isolates could outcompete strains that arose
late in the experiment. Competitive ability of a strain was always
better than its previous type, but competitiveness in a general sense
was not increasing. Any organism's success depends on the behavior of
its contemporaries. For most traits or behaviors there is likely no
optimal design or strategy, only contingent ones. Evolution can be
like a game of paper/scissors/rock.

 
Organisms are not passive targets of their environment. Each
species modifies its own environment. At the least, organisms
remove nutrients from and add waste to their surroundings. Often,
waste products benefit other species. Animal dung is fertilizer for
plants. Conversely, the oxygen we breathe is a waste product of
plants. Species do not simply change to fit their environment; they
modify their environment to suit them as well. Beavers build a
dam to create a pond suitable to sustain them and raise young.
Alternately, when the environment changes, species can migrate
to suitable climes or seek out microenvironments to which they
are adapted.

 Genetic Variation 

 
Evolution requires genetic variation. If there were no dark moths,
the population could not have evolved from mostly light to mostly
dark. In order for continuing evolution there must be mechanisms
to increase or create genetic variation and mechanisms to decrease
it. Mutation is a change in a gene. These changes are the source of
new genetic variation. Natural selection operates on this variation.

 
Genetic variation has two components: allelic diversity and non-
random associations of alleles. Alleles are different versions of the
same gene. For example, humans can have A, B or O alleles that
determine one aspect of their blood type. Most animals, including
humans, are diploid -- they contain two alleles for every gene at
every locus, one inherited from their mother and one inherited
from their father. Locus is the location of a gene on a chromosome.
Humans can be AA, AB, AO, BB, BO or OO at the blood group locus.
If the two alleles at a locus are the same type (for instance two
A alleles) the individual would be called homozygous. An
individual with two different alleles at a locus (for example, an
AB individual) is called heterozygous. At any locus there can be
many different alleles in a population, more alleles than any single
organism can possess. For example, no single human can have an A, B
and an O allele.

 
Considerable variation is present in natural populations. At 45
percent of loci in plants there is more than one allele in the gene
pool. [allele: alternate version of a gene (created by mutation)] Any
given plant is likely to be heterozygous at about 15 percent of its
loci. Levels of genetic variation in animals range from roughly 15%
of loci having more than one allele (polymorphic) in birds, to over
50% of loci being polymorphic in insects. Mammals and reptiles are
polymorphic at about 20% of their loci - - amphibians and fish are
polymorphic at around 30% of their loci. In most populations, there
are enough loci and enough different alleles that every individual,
identical twins excepted, has a unique combination of alleles.

 
Linkage disequilibrium is a measure of association between alleles
of two different genes. [allele: alternate version of a gene] If two
alleles were found together in organisms more often than would be
expected, the alleles are in linkage disequilibrium. If there two loci
in an organism (A and B) and two alleles at each of these loci (A1,
A2, B1 and B2) linkage disequilibrium (D) is calculated as D =
f(A1B1) * f(A2B2) - f(A1B2) * f(A2B1) (where f(X) is the frequency
of X in the population). [Loci (plural of locus): location of a gene on
a chromosome] D varies between -1/4 and 1/4; the greater the
deviation from zero, the greater the linkage. The sign is simply a
consequence of how the alleles are numbered. Linkage
disequilibrium can be the result of physical proximity of the genes.
Or, it can be maintained by natural selection if some combinations
of alleles work better as a team.

 
Natural selection maintains the linkage disequilibrium between
color and pattern alleles in Papilio memnon . [linkage
disequilibrium: association between alleles at different loci] In this
moth species, there is a gene that determines wing morphology.
One allele at this locus leads to a moth that has a tail; the other allele
codes for a untailed moth. There is another gene that determines if
the wing is brightly or darkly colored. There are thus four possible
types of moths: brightly colored moths with and without tails, and
dark moths with and without tails. All four can be produced when
moths are brought into the lab and bred. However, only two of
these types of moths are found in the wild: brightly colored moths
with tails and darkly colored moths without tails. The non-random
association is maintained by natural selection. Bright, tailed moths
mimic the pattern of an unpalatable species. The dark morph is
cryptic. The other two combinations are neither mimetic nor cryptic
and are quickly eaten by birds.

 
Assortative mating causes a non-random distribution of alleles at a
single locus. [locus: location of a gene on a chromosome] If there are
two alleles (A and a) at a locus with frequencies p and q, the
frequency of the three possible genotypes (AA, Aa and aa) will be
p 2 , 2pq and q 2 ,
respectively. For example, if the frequency of
A is 0.9 and the frequency of a is 0.1, the frequencies of AA, Aa
and aa individuals are: 0.81, 0.18 and 0.01. This distribution is
called the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

 
Non-random mating results in a deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg
distribution. Humans mate assortatively according to race; we are
more likely to mate with someone of own race than another. In
populations that mate this way, fewer heterozygotes are found
than would be predicted under random mating. [heterozygote: an
organism that has two different alleles at a locus] A decrease in
heterozygotes can be the result of mate choice, or simply the result
of population subdivision. Most organisms have a limited dispersal
capability, so their mate will be chosen from the local population.


 Evolution within a Lineage 

 
In order for continuing evolution there must be mechanisms to
increase or create genetic variation and mechanisms to decrease it.
The mechanisms of evolution are mutation, natural selection,
genetic drift, recombination and gene flow. I have grouped them
into two classes -- those that decrease genetic variation and those
that increase it.

 Mechanisms that Decrease Genetic Variation 

 
  Natural Selection 
 

 
Some types of organisms within a population leave more offspring
than others. Over time, the frequency of the more prolific type will
increase. The difference in reproductive capability is called natural
selection. Natural selection is the only mechanism of adaptive
evolution; it is defined as differential reproductive success of pre-
existing classes of genetic variants in the gene pool.

 
The most common action of natural selection is to remove unfit
variants as they arise via mutation. [natural selection: differential
reproductive success of genotypes] In other words, natural
selection usually prevents new alleles from increasing in
frequency. This led a famous evolutionist, George Williams, to say
"Evolution proceeds in spite of natural selection."

 
Natural selection can maintain or deplete genetic variation
depending on how it acts. When selection acts to weed out
deleterious alleles, or causes an allele to sweep to fixation, it
depletes genetic variation. When heterozygotes are more fit than
either of the homozygotes, however, selection causes genetic
variation to be maintained. [heterozygote: an organism that has two
different alleles at a locus. | homozygote: an organism that has two
identical alleles at a locus] This is called balancing selection. An
example of this is the maintenance of sickle-cell alleles in human
populations subject to malaria. Variation at a single locus
determines whether red blood cells are shaped normally or sickled.
If a human has two alleles for sickle-cell, he/she develops anemia
-- the shape of sickle-cells precludes them carrying normal levels
of oxygen. However, heterozygotes who have one copy of the
sickle-cell allele, coupled with one normal allele enjoy some
resistance to malaria -- the shape of sickled cells make it harder
for the plasmodia (malaria causing agents) to enter the cell.
Thus, individuals homozygous for the normal allele suffer more
malaria than heterozygotes. Individuals homozygous for the sickle-
cell are anemic. Heterozygotes have the highest fitness of these
three types. Heterozygotes pass on both sickle-cell and normal
alleles to the next generation. Thus, neither allele can be eliminated
from the gene pool. The sickle-cell allele is at its highest frequency
in regions of Africa where malaria is most pervasive.

 
Balancing selection is rare in natural populations. [balancing
selection: selection favoring heterozygotes] Only a handful of other
cases beside the sickle-cell example have been found. At one time
population geneticists thought balancing selection could be a
general explanation for the levels of genetic variation found in
natural populations. That is no longer the case. Balancing selection
is only rarely found in natural populations. And, there are theoretical
reasons why natural selection cannot maintain polymorphisms at
several loci via balancing selection.

 
Individuals are selected. The example I gave earlier was an
example of evolution via natural selection. [natural selection:
differential reproductive success of genotypes] Dark colored moths
had a higher reproductive success because light colored moths
suffered a higher predation rate. The decline of light colored alleles
was caused by light colored individuals being removed from the
gene pool (selected against). Individual organisms either reproduce
or fail to reproduce and are hence the unit of selection. One way
alleles can change in frequency is to be housed in organisms with
different reproductive rates. Genes are not the unit of selection
(because their success depends on the organism's other genes as
well); neither are groups of organisms a unit of selection. There are
some exceptions to this "rule," but it is a good generalization.

 
Organisms do not perform any behaviors that are for the good of
their species. An individual organism competes primarily with
others of it own species for its reproductive success. Natural
selection favors selfish behavior because any truly altruistic act
increases the recipient's reproductive success while lowering the
donors. Altruists would disappear from a population as the non-
altruists would reap the benefits, but not pay the costs, of
altruistic acts. Many behaviors appear altruistic. Biologists,
however, can demonstrate that these behaviors are only apparently
altruistic. Cooperating with or helping other organisms is often the
most selfish strategy for an animal. This is called reciprocal
altruism. A good example of this is blood sharing in vampire bats.
In these bats, those lucky enough to find a meal will often share
part of it with an unsuccessful bat by regurgitating some blood into
the other's mouth. Biologists have found that these bats form bonds
with partners and help each other out when the other is needy. If a
bat is found to be a "cheater," (he accepts blood when starving, but
does not donate when his partner is) his partner will abandon him.
The bats are thus not helping each other altruistically; they form
pacts that are mutually beneficial.

 
Helping closely related organisms can appear altruistic; but this is
also a selfish behavior. Reproductive success (fitness) has two
components; direct fitness and indirect fitness. Direct fitness is a
measure of how many alleles, on average, a genotype contributes
to the subsequent generation's gene pool by reproducing. Indirect
fitness is a measure of how many alleles identical to its own it
helps to enter the gene pool. Direct fitness plus indirect fitness is
inclusive fitness. J. B. S. Haldane once remarked he would gladly
drown, if by doing so he saved two siblings or eight cousins. Each of
his siblings would share one half his alleles; his cousins, one eighth.
They could potentially add as many of his alleles to the gene pool
as he could.

 
Natural selection favors traits or behaviors that increase a
genotype's inclusive fitness. Closely related organisms share many
of the same alleles. In diploid species, siblings share on average at
least 50% of their alleles. The percentage is higher if the parents
are related. So, helping close relatives to reproduce gets an
organism's own alleles better represented in the gene pool. The
benefit of helping relatives increases dramatically in highly inbred
species. In some cases, organisms will completely forgo
reproducing and only help their relatives reproduce. Ants, and
other eusocial insects, have sterile castes that only serve the
queen and assist her reproductive efforts. The sterile workers
are reproducing by proxy.

 
The words selfish and altruistic have connotations in everyday
use that biologists do not intend. Selfish simply means behaving
in such a way that one's own inclusive fitness is maximized;
altruistic means behaving in such a way that another's fitness is
increased at the expense of ones' own. Use of the words selfish
and altruistic is not meant to imply that organisms consciously
understand their motives.

 
The opportunity for natural selection to operate does not induce
genetic variation to appear -- selection only distinguishes between
existing variants. Variation is not possible along every imaginable
axis, so all possible adaptive solutions are not open to populations.
To pick a somewhat ridiculous example, a steel shelled turtle might
be an improvement over regular turtles. Turtles are killed quite a
bit by cars these days because when confronted with danger, they
retreat into their shells -- this is not a great strategy against a two
ton automobile. However, there is no variation in metal content of
shells, so it would not be possible to select for a steel shelled turtle.

 
Here is a second example of natural selection. Geospiza fortis lives
on the Galapagos islands along with fourteen other finch species. It
feeds on the seeds of the plant Tribulus cistoides, specializing on
the smaller seeds. Another species, G. Magnirostris, has a larger
beak and specializes on the larger seeds. The health of these bird
populations depends on seed production. Seed production, in turn,
depends on the arrival of wet season. In 1977, there was a
drought. Rainfall was well below normal and fewer seeds were
produced. As the season progressed, the G. fortis population
depleted the supply of small seeds. Eventually, only larger seeds
remained. Most of the finches starved; the population plummeted
from about twelve hundred birds to less than two hundred. Peter
Grant, who had been studying these finches, noted that larger
beaked birds fared better than smaller beaked ones. These larger
birds had offspring with correspondingly large beaks. Thus, there
was an increase in the proportion of large beaked birds in the
population the next generation. To prove that the change in bill size
in Geospiza fortis was an evolutionary change, Grant had to show
that differences in bill size were at least partially genetically based.
He did so by crossing finches of various beak sizes and showing
that a finch's beak size was influenced by its parent's genes. Large
beaked birds had large beaked offspring; beak size was not due to
environmental differences (in parental care, for example).

 
Natural selection may not lead a population to have the optimal
set of traits. In any population, there would be a certain
combination of possible alleles that would produce the optimal set
of traits (the global optimum); but there are other sets of alleles
that would yield a population almost as adapted (local optima).
Transition from a local optimum to the global optimum may be
hindered or forbidden because the population would have to pass
through less adaptive states to make the transition. Natural
selection only works to bring populations to the nearest optimal
point. This idea is Sewall Wright's adaptive landscape. This is one
of the most influential models that shape how evolutionary
biologists view evolution.

 
Natural selection does not have any foresight. It only allows
organisms to adapt to their current environment. Structures or
behaviors do not evolve for future utility. An organism adapts to
its environment at each stage of its evolution. As the environment
changes, new traits may be selected for. Large changes in
populations are the result of cumulative natural selection. Changes
are introduced into the population by mutation; the small minority
of these changes that result in a greater reproductive output of
their bearers are amplified in frequency by selection.

 
Complex traits must evolve through viable intermediates. For many
traits, it initially seems unlikely that intermediates would be
viable. What good is half a wing? Half a wing may be no good for
flying, but it may be useful in other ways. Feathers are thought to
have evolved as insulation (ever worn a down jacket?) and/or as a
way to trap insects. Later, proto-birds may have learned to glide
when leaping from tree to tree. Eventually, the feathers that
originally served as insulation now became co-opted for use in
flight. A trait's current utility is not always indicative of its past
utility. It can evolve for one purpose, and be used later for another.
A trait evolved for its current utility is an adaptation; one that
evolved for another utility is an exaptation. An example of an
exaptation is a penguin's wing. Penguins evolved from flying
ancestors; now they are flightless and use their wings for
swimming.


  Common Misconceptions about Selection 

 
Selection is not a force in the sense that gravity or the strong
nuclear force is. However, for the sake of brevity, biologists
sometimes refer to it that way. This often leads to some confusion
when biologists speak of selection "pressures." This implies that the
environment "pushes" a population to more adapted state. This is
not the case. Selection merely favors beneficial genetic changes
when they occur by chance -- it does not contribute to their
appearance. The potential for selection to act may long precede the
appearance of selectable genetic variation. When selection is
spoken of as a force, it often seems that it is has a mind of its own;
or as if it was nature personified. This most often occurs when
biologists are waxing poetic about selection. This has no place in
scientific discussions of evolution. Selection is not a guided or
cognizant entity; it is simply an effect.

 
A related pitfall in discussing selection is anthropomorphizing on
behalf of living things. Often conscious motives are seemingly
imputed to organisms, or even genes, when discussing evolution.
This happens most frequently when discussing animal behavior.
Animals are often said to perform some behavior because selection
will favor it. This could more accurately worded as "animals that,
due to their genetic composition, perform this behavior tend to be
favored by natural selection relative to those who, due to their
genetic composition, don't." Such wording is cumbersome. To avoid
this, biologists often anthropomorphize. This is unfortunate because
it often makes evolutionary arguments sound silly. Keep in mind
this is only for convenience of expression.

 
The phrase "survival of the fittest" is often used synonymously
with natural selection. The phrase is both incomplete and
misleading. For one thing, survival is only one component of
selection -- and perhaps one of the less important ones in many
populations. For example, in polygynous species, a number of males
survive to reproductive age, but only a few ever mate. Males may
differ little in their ability to survive, but greatly in their ability to
attract mates -- the difference in reproductive success stems
mainly from the latter consideration. Also, the word fit is often
confused with physically fit. Fitness, in an evolutionary sense, is
the average reproductive output of a class of genetic variants in a
gene pool. Fit does not necessarily mean biggest, fastest or
strongest.

  Sexual Selection 

 
In many species, males develop prominent secondary sexual
characteristics. A few oft cited examples are the peacock's tail,
coloring and patterns in male birds in general, voice calls in frogs
and flashes in fireflies. Many of these traits are a liability
from the standpoint of survival. Any ostentatious trait or noisy,
attention getting behavior will alert predators as well as potential
mates. How then could natural selection favor these traits?

 
Natural selection can be broken down into many components, of
which survival is only one. Sexual attractiveness is a very
important component of selection, so much so that biologists use
the term sexual selection when they talk about this subset of
natural selection.

 
Sexual selection is natural selection operating on factors that
contribute to an organism's mating success. Traits that are a
liability to survival can evolve when the sexual attractiveness of a
trait outweighs the liability incurred for survival. A male who lives
a short time, but produces many offspring is much more successful
than a long lived one that produces few. The former's genes will
eventually dominate the gene pool of his species. In many species,
especially polygynous species where only a few males monopolize
all the females, sexual selection has caused pronounced sexual
dimorphism. In these species males compete against other males
for mates. The competition can be either direct or mediated by
female choice. In species where females choose, males compete by
displaying striking phenotypic characteristics and/or performing
elaborate courtship behaviors. The females then mate with the
males that most interest them, usually the ones with the most
outlandish displays. There are many competing theories as to why
females are attracted to these displays.

 
The good genes model states that the display indicates some
component of male fitness. A good genes advocate would say that
bright coloring in male birds indicates a lack of parasites. The
females are cueing on some signal that is correlated with some
other component of viability.

 
Selection for good genes can be seen in sticklebacks. In these fish,
males have red coloration on their sides. Milinski and Bakker
showed that intensity of color was correlated to both parasite load
and sexual attractiveness. Females preferred redder males. The
redness indicated that he was carrying fewer parasites.

 
Evolution can get stuck in a positive feedback loop. Another model
to explain secondary sexual characteristics is called the runaway
sexual selection model. R. A. Fisher proposed that females may
have an innate preference for some male trait before it appears in
a population. Females would then mate with male carriers when
the trait appears. The offspring of these matings have the genes for
both the trait and the preference for the trait. As a result, the
process snowballs until natural selection brings it into check.
Suppose that female birds prefer males with longer than average
tail feathers. Mutant males with longer than average feathers will
produce more offspring than the short feathered males. In the next
generation, average tail length will increase. As the generations
progress, feather length will increase because females do not prefer
a specific length tail, but a longer than average tail. Eventually
tail length will increase to the point were the liability to survival
is matched by the sexual attractiveness of the trait and an equilibrium
will be established. Note that in many exotic birds male plumage is
often very showy and many species do in fact have males with greatly
elongated feathers. In some cases these feathers are shed after the
breeding season.

 
None of the above models are mutually exclusive. There are
millions of sexually dimorphic species on this planet and the forms
of sexual selection probably vary amongst them.

  Genetic Drift 

 
Allele frequencies can change due to chance alone. This is called
genetic drift. Drift is a binomial sampling error of the gene pool.
What this means is, the alleles that form the next generation's gene
pool are a sample of the alleles from the current generation. When
sampled from a population, the frequency of alleles differs slightly
due to chance alone.

 
Alleles can increase or decrease in frequency due to drift. The average
expected change in allele frequency is zero, since increasing or
decreasing in frequency is equally probable. A small percentage of
alleles may continually change frequency in a single direction for
several generations just as flipping a fair coin may, on occasion,
result in a string of heads or tails. A very few new mutant alleles
can drift to fixation in this manner.

 
In small populations, the variance in the rate of change of allele
frequencies is greater than in large populations. However, the
overall rate of genetic drift (measured in substitutions per
generation) is independent of population size. [genetic drift: a
random change in allele frequencies] If the mutation rate is
constant, large and small populations lose alleles to drift at the
same rate. This is because large populations will have more alleles
in the gene pool, but they will lose them more slowly. Smaller
populations will have fewer alleles, but these will quickly cycle
through. This assumes that mutation is constantly adding new
alleles to the gene pool and selection is not operating on any of
these alleles.

 
Sharp drops in population size can change allele frequencies
substantially. When a population crashes, the alleles in the
surviving sample may not be representative of the precrash gene
pool. This change in the gene pool is called the founder effect,
because small populations of organisms that invade a new territory
(founders) are subject to this. Many biologists feel the genetic
changes brought about by founder effects may contribute to isolated
populations developing reproductive isolation from their parent
populations. In sufficiently small populations, genetic drift can
counteract selection. [genetic drift: a random change in allele
frequencies] Mildly deleterious alleles may drift to fixation.

 
Wright and Fisher disagreed on the importance of drift. Fisher
thought populations were sufficiently large that drift could be
neglected. Wright argued that populations were often divided into
smaller subpopulations. Drift could cause allele frequency
differences between subpopulations if gene flow was small enough.
If a subpopulation was small enough, the population could even
drift through fitness valleys in the adaptive landscape. Then, the
subpopulation could climb a larger fitness hill. Gene flow out of this
subpopulation could contribute to the population as a whole
adapting. This is Wright's Shifting Balance theory of evolution.

 
Both natural selection and genetic drift decrease genetic variation.
If they were the only mechanisms of evolution, populations would
eventually become homogeneous and further evolution would be
impossible. There are, however, mechanisms that replace variation
depleted by selection and drift. These are discussed below.

 Mechanisms that Increase Genetic Variation 


 
  Mutation 
 

 
The cellular machinery that copies DNA sometimes makes
mistakes. These mistakes alter the sequence of a gene. This is
called a mutation. There are many kinds of mutations. A point
mutation is a mutation in which one "letter" of the genetic code is
changed to another. Lengths of DNA can also be deleted or inserted
in a gene; these are also mutations. Finally, genes or parts of genes
can become inverted or duplicated. Typical rates of mutation are
between 10 -10 and 10 -12 mutations per base pair of DNA per
generation.

 
Most mutations are thought to be neutral with regards to fitness.
(Kimura defines neutral as |s| &lt; 1/2Ne, where s is the selective
coefficient and Ne is the effective population size.) Only a small
portion of the genome of eukaryotes contains coding segments.
And, although some non-coding DNA is involved in gene regulation
or other cellular functions, it is probable that most base changes
would have no fitness consequence.

 
Most mutations that have any phenotypic effect are deleterious.
Mutations that result in amino acid substitutions can change the
shape of a protein, potentially changing or eliminating its function.
This can lead to inadequacies in biochemical pathways or interfere
with the process of development. Organisms are sufficiently
integrated that most random changes will not produce a fitness
benefit. Only a very small percentage of mutations are beneficial.
The ratio of neutral to deleterious to beneficial mutations is
unknown and probably varies with respect to details of the locus in
question and environment.

 
Mutation limits the rate of evolution. The rate of evolution can be
expressed in terms of nucleotide substitutions in a lineage per
generation. Substitution is the replacement of an allele by another
in a population. This is a two step process: First a mutation occurs
in an individual, creating a new allele. This allele subsequently
increases in frequency to fixation in the population. The rate of
evolution is k = 2Nvu (in diploids) where k is nucleotide
substitutions, N is the effective population size, v is the rate of
mutation and u is the proportion of mutants that eventually fix in
the population.

 
Mutation need not be limiting over short time spans. The rate of
evolution expressed above is given as a steady state equation;
it assumes the system is at equilibrium. Given the time frames
for a single mutant to fix, it is unclear if populations are ever at
equilibrium. A change in environment can cause previously neutral
alleles to have selective values; in the short term evolution can run
on "stored" variation and thus is independent of mutation rate.
Other mechanisms can also contribute selectable variation.
Recombination creates new combinations of alleles (or new alleles)
by joining sequences with separate microevolutionary histories
within a population. Gene flow can also supply the gene pool with
variants. Of course, the ultimate source of these variants is
mutation.

  The Fate of Mutant Alleles 

 
Mutation creates new alleles. Each new allele enters the gene pool
as a single copy amongst many. Most are lost from the gene pool,
the organism carrying them fails to reproduce, or reproduces but does
not pass on that particular allele. A mutant's fate is shared with the
genetic background it appears in. A new allele will initially be linked
to other loci in its genetic background, even loci on other chromosomes.
If the allele increases in frequency in the population, initially it
will be paired with other alleles at that locus -- the new allele will
primarily be carried in individuals heterozygous for that locus.
The chance of it being paired with itself is low until it reaches
intermediate frequency. If the allele is recessive, its effect won't be
seen in any individual until a homozygote is formed. The
eventual fate of the allele depends on whether it is neutral,
deleterious or beneficial.


   Neutral alleles 

 
Most neutral alleles are lost soon after they appear. The average
time (in generations) until loss of a neutral allele is 2(Ne/N) ln(2N)
where N is the effective population size (the number of individuals
contributing to the next generation's gene pool) and N is the total
population size. Only a small percentage of alleles fix. Fixation is
the process of an allele increasing to a frequency at or near one. The
probability of a neutral allele fixing in a population is equal to its
frequency. For a new mutant in a diploid population, this frequency
is 1/2N.

 
If mutations are neutral with respect to fitness, the rate of
substitution (k) is equal to the rate of mutation(v). This does not
mean every new mutant eventually reaches fixation. Alleles are
added to the gene pool by mutation at the same rate they are lost
to drift. For neutral alleles that do fix, it takes an average of 4N
generations to do so. However, at equilibrium there are multiple
alleles segregating in the population. In small populations, few
mutations appear each generation. The ones that fix do so quickly
relative to large populations. In large populations, more mutants
appear over the generations. But, the ones that fix take much
longer to do so. Thus, the rate of neutral evolution (in substitutions
per generation) is independent of population size.

 
The rate of mutation determines the level of heterozygosity at a
locus according to the neutral theory. Heterozygosity is simply the
proportion of the population that is heterozygous. Equilibrium
heterozygosity is given as H = 4Nv/[4Nv+1] (for diploid
populations). H can vary from a very small number to almost one.
In small populations, H is small (because the equation is
approximately a very small number divided by one). In (biologically
unrealistically) large populations, heterozygosity approaches one
(because the equation is approximately a large number divided by
itself). Directly testing this model is difficult because N and v
can only be estimated for most natural populations. But,
heterozygosities are believed to be too low to be described by
a strictly neutral model. Solutions offered by neutralists for
this discrepancy include hypothesizing that natural populations
may not be at equilibrium.

 
At equilibrium there should be a few alleles at intermediate
frequency and many at very low frequencies. This is the Ewens-
Watterson distribution. New alleles enter a population every
generation, most remain at low frequency until they are lost. A few
drift to intermediate frequencies, a very few drift all the way to
fixation. In Drosophila pseudoobscura , the protein Xanthine
dehydrogenase (Xdh) has many variants. In a single population,
Keith, et. al., found that 59 of 96 proteins were of one type, two
others were represented ten and nine times and nine other types
were present singly or in low numbers.

   Deleterious alleles 

 
Deleterious mutants are selected against but remain at low frequency
in the gene pool. In diploids, a deleterious recessive mutant may
increase in frequency due to drift. Selection cannot see it when it
is masked by a dominant allele. Many disease causing alleles
remain at low frequency for this reason. People who are carriers
do not suffer the negative effect of the allele. Unless they mate
with another carrier, the allele may simply continue to be passed on.
Deleterious alleles also remain in populations at a low frequency due
to a balance between recurrent mutation and selection. This is called
the mutation load.


   Beneficial alleles 

 
Most new mutants are lost, even beneficial ones. Wright calculated
that the probability of fixation of a beneficial allele is 2s. (This
assumes a large population size, a small fitness benefit, and that
heterozygotes have an intermediate fitness. A benefit of 2s yields
an overall rate of evolution: k=4Nvs where v is the mutation rate to
beneficial alleles) An allele that conferred a one percent increase in
fitness only has a two percent chance of fixing. The probability of
fixation of beneficial type of mutant is boosted by recurrent
mutation. The beneficial mutant may be lost several times, but
eventually it will arise and stick in a population. (Recall that even
deleterious mutants recur in a population.)

 
Directional selection depletes genetic variation at the selected locus
as the fitter allele sweeps to fixation. Sequences linked to the
selected allele also increase in frequency due to hitchhiking. The
lower the rate of recombination, the larger the window of sequence
that hitchhikes. Begun and Aquadro compared the level of
nucleotide polymorphism within and between species with the rate
of recombination at a locus. Low levels of nucleotide
polymorphism within species coincided with low rates of
recombination. This could be explained by molecular mechanisms if
recombination itself was mutagenic. In this case, recombination
with also be correlated with nucleotide divergence between
species. But, the level of sequence divergence did not correlate
with the rate of recombination. Thus, they inferred that
selection was the cause. The correlation between recombination
and nucleotide polymorphism leaves the conclusion that selective
sweeps occur often enough to leave an imprint on the level of
genetic variation in natural populations.

 
One example of a beneficial mutation comes from the mosquito
 Culex pipiens . In this organism, a gene that was involved with
breaking down organophosphates - common insecticide ingredients
-became duplicated. Progeny of the organism with this mutation
quickly swept across the worldwide mosquito population. There
are numerous examples of insects developing resistance to
chemicals, especially DDT which was once heavily used in this
country. And, most importantly, even though "good" mutations
happen much less frequently than "bad" ones, organisms with
"good" mutations thrive while organisms with "bad" ones die out.

 
If beneficial mutants arise infrequently, the only fitness
differences in a population will be due to new deleterious mutants
and the deleterious recessives. Selection will simply be weeding
out unfit variants. Only occasionally will a beneficial allele be
sweeping through a population. The general lack of large fitness
differences segregating in natural populations argues that
beneficial mutants do indeed arise infrequently. However, the
impact of a beneficial mutant on the level of variation at a locus
can be large and lasting. It takes many generations for a locus
to regain appreciable levels of heterozygosity following a
selective sweep.

  Recombination 

 
Each chromosome in our sperm or egg cells is a mixture of genes
from our mother and our father. Recombination can be thought of
as gene shuffling. Most organisms have linear chromosomes and
their genes lie at specific location (loci) along them. Bacteria have
circular chromosomes. In most sexually reproducing organisms,
there are two of each chromosome type in every cell. For instance
in humans, every chromosome is paired, one inherited from the
mother, the other inherited from the father. When an organism
produces gametes, the gametes end up with only one of each
chromosome per cell. Haploid gametes are produced from diploid
cells by a process called meiosis.

 
In meiosis, homologous chromosomes line up. The DNA of the
chromosome is broken on both chromosomes in several places and
rejoined with the other strand. Later, the two homologous
chromosomes are split into two separate cells that divide and
become gametes. But, because of recombination, both of the
chromosomes are a mix of alleles from the mother and father.

 
Recombination creates new combinations of alleles. Alleles that
arose at different times and different places can be brought
together. Recombination can occur not only between genes, but
within genes as well. Recombination within a gene can form a new
allele. Recombination is a mechanism of evolution because it adds
new alleles and combinations of alleles to the gene pool.


  Gene Flow 

 
New organisms may enter a population by migration from another
population. If they mate within the population, they can bring new
alleles to the local gene pool. This is called gene flow. In some
closely related species, fertile hybrids can result from interspecific
matings. These hybrids can vector genes from species to species.

 
Gene flow between more distantly related species occurs
infrequently. This is called horizontal transfer. One interesting case
of this involves genetic elements called P elements. Margaret
Kidwell found that P elements were transferred from some species
in the Drosophila willistoni group to Drosophila melanogaster .
These two species of fruit flies are distantly related and hybrids do
not form. Their ranges do, however, overlap. The P elements were
vectored into D. melanogaster via a parasitic mite that targets
both these species. This mite punctures the exoskeleton of the flies
and feeds on the "juices". Material, including DNA, from one fly can
be transferred to another when the mite feeds. Since P elements
actively move in the genome (they are themselves parasites of
DNA), one incorporated itself into the genome of a melanogaster 
fly and subsequently spread through the species. Laboratory stocks
of melanogaster caught prior to the 1940's lack of P elements. All
natural populations today harbor them.

 Overview of Evolution within a Lineage 

 
Evolution is a change in the gene pool of a population over time; it
can occur due to several factors. Three mechanisms add new alleles
to the gene pool: mutation, recombination and gene flow. Two
mechanisms remove alleles, genetic drift and natural selection.
Drift removes alleles randomly from the gene pool. Selection
removes deleterious alleles from the gene pool. The amount of
genetic variation found in a population is the balance between the
actions of these mechanisms.

 
Natural selection can also increase the frequency of an allele.
Selection that weeds out harmful alleles is called negative selection.
Selection that increases the frequency of helpful alleles is called
positive, or sometimes positive Darwinian, selection. A new allele
can also drift to high frequency. But, since the change in frequency
of an allele each generation is random, nobody speaks of positive
or negative drift.

 
Except in rare cases of high gene flow, new alleles enter the
gene pool as a single copy. Most new alleles added to the gene pool
are lost almost immediately due to drift or selection; only a small
percent ever reach a high frequency in the population. Even most
moderately beneficial alleles are lost due to drift when they
appear. But, a mutation can reappear numerous times.

 
The fate of any new allele depends a great deal on the organism it
appears in. This allele will be linked to the other alleles near it for
many generations. A mutant allele can increase in frequency
simply because it is linked to a beneficial allele at a nearby locus.
This can occur even if the mutant allele is deleterious, although it
must not be so deleterious as to offset the benefit of the other
allele. Likewise a potentially beneficial new allele can be
eliminated from the gene pool because it was linked to deleterious
alleles when it first arose. An allele "riding on the coat tails" of a
beneficial allele is called a hitchhiker. Eventually, recombination
will bring the two loci to linkage equilibrium. But, the more closely
linked two alleles are, the longer the hitchhiking will last.

 
The effects of selection and drift are coupled. Drift is intensified as
selection pressures increase. This is because increased selection (i.e.
a greater difference in reproductive success among organisms in a
population) reduces the effective population size, the number of
individuals contributing alleles to the next generation.

 
Adaptation is brought about by cumulative natural selection, the
repeated sifting of mutations by natural selection. Small changes,
favored by selection, can be the stepping-stone to further changes.
The summation of large numbers of these changes is
macroevolution.

 The Development of Evolutionary Theory 

 
Biology came of age as a science when Charles Darwin published
"On the Origin of Species." But, the idea of evolution wasn't new to
Darwin. Lamarck published a theory of evolution in 1809. Lamarck
thought that species arose continually from nonliving sources.
These species were initially very primitive, but increased in
complexity over time due to some inherent tendency. This type of
evolution is called orthogenesis. Lamarck proposed that an
organism's acclimation to the environment could be passed on to its
offspring. For example, he thought proto-giraffes stretched their
necks to reach higher twigs. This caused their offspring to be born
with longer necks. This proposed mechanism of evolution is called
the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Lamarck also believed
species never went extinct, although they may change into newer
forms. All three of these ideas are now known to be wrong.

 
Darwin's contributions include hypothesizing the pattern of
common descent and proposing a mechanism for evolution --
natural selection. In Darwin's theory of natural selection, new
variants arise continually within populations. A small percentage of
these variants cause their bearers to produce more offspring than
others. These variants thrive and supplant their less productive
competitors. The effect of numerous instances of selection would
lead to a species being modified over time.

 
Darwin's theory did not accord with older theories of genetics. In
Darwin's time, biologists held to the theory of blending inheritance
-- an offspring was an average of its parents. If an individual had
one short parent and one tall parent, it would be of medium height.
And, the offspring would pass on genes for medium sized offspring.
If this was the case, new genetic variations would quickly be
diluted out of a population. They could not accumulate as the
theory of evolution required. We now know that the idea of
blending inheritance is wrong.

 
Darwin didn't know that the true mode of inheritance was discovered
in his lifetime. Gregor Mendel, in his experiments on hybrid peas,
showed that genes from a mother and father do not blend. An offspring
from a short and a tall parent may be medium sized; but it carries
genes for shortness and tallness. The genes remain distinct and can
be passed on to subsequent generations. Mendel mailed his paper to
Darwin, but Darwin never opened it.

 
It was a long time until Mendel's ideas were accepted. One group of
biologists, called biometricians, thought Mendel's laws only held for
a few traits. Most traits, they claimed, were governed by blending
inheritance. Mendel studied discrete traits. Two of the traits in his
famous experiments were smooth versus wrinkled coat on peas.
This trait did not vary continuously. In other words, peas are
either wrinkled or smooth -- intermediates are not found.
Biometricians considered these traits aberrations. They studied
continuously varying traits like size and believed most traits
showed blending inheritance.


 
 Incorporating Genetics into Evolutionary Theory 
 

 
The discrete genes Mendel discovered would exist at some
frequency in natural populations. Biologists wondered how and if
these frequencies would change. Many thought that the more
common versions of genes would increase in frequency simply
because they were already at high frequency.

 
Hardy and Weinberg independently showed that the frequency of
an allele would not change over time simply due to its being rare
or common. Their model had several assumptions -- that all alleles
reproduced at the same rate, that the population size was very
large and that alleles did not change in form. Later, R. A. Fisher
showed that Mendel's laws could explain continuous traits if the
expression of these traits were due to the action of many genes.
After this, geneticists accepted Mendel's Laws as the basic rules of
genetics. From this basis, Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S.. Haldane
founded the field of population genetics. Population genetics is a
field of biology that attempts to measure and explain the levels of
genetic variation in populations.

 
R. A. Fisher studied the effect of natural selection on large
populations. He demonstrated that even very small selective
differences amongst alleles could cause appreciable changes in
allele frequencies over time. He also showed that the rate of
adaptive change in a population is proportional to the amount of
genetic variation present. This is called Fisher's Fundamental
Theorem of Natural Selection. Although it is called the
fundamental theorem, it does not hold in all cases. The rate at
which natural selection brings about adaptation depends on the
details of how selection is working. In some rare cases, natural
selection can actually cause a decline in the mean relative fitness of
a population.

 
Sewall Wright was more concerned with drift. He stressed that
large populations are often subdivided into many subpopulations.
In his theory, genetic drift played a more important role compared
to selection. Differentiation between subpopulations, followed by
migration among them, could contribute to adaptations amongst
populations. Wright also came up with the idea of the adaptive
landscape -- an idea that remains influential to this day. Its
influence remains even though P. A. P. Moran has shown that,
mathematically, adaptive landscapes don't exist as Wright
envisioned them. Wright extended his results of one-locus
models to a two-locus case in proposing the adaptive landscape.
But, unbeknownst to him, the general conclusions of the one-locus
model don't extend to the two-locus case.

 
J. B. S. Haldane developed many of the mathematical models of
natural and artificial selection. He showed that selection and
mutation could oppose each other, that deleterious mutations could
remain in a population due to recurrent mutation. He also
demonstrated that there was a cost to natural selection,
placing a limit on the amount of adaptive substitutions a
population could undergo in a given time frame.

 
For a long time, population genetics developed as a theoretical
field. But, gathering the data needed to test the theories was nearly
impossible. Prior to the advent of molecular biology, estimates of
genetic variability could only be inferred from levels of
morphological differences in populations. Lewontin and Hubby
were the first to get a good estimate of genetic variation in a
population. Using the then new technique of protein
electrophoresis, they showed that 30% of the loci in a population of
 Drosophila pseudoobscura were polymorphic. They also showed
that it was likely that they could not detect all the variation that
was present. Upon finding this level of variation, the question became
-- was this maintained by natural selection, or simply the result of
genetic drift? This level of variation was too high to be explained
by balancing selection.

 
Motoo Kimura theorized that most variation found in populations
was selectively equivalent (neutral). Multiple alleles at a locus
differed in sequence, but their fitnesses were the same. Kimura's
neutral theory described rates of evolution and levels of
polymorphism solely in terms of mutation and genetic drift. The
neutral theory did not deny that natural selection acted on natural
populations; but it claimed that the majority of natural variation
was transient polymorphisms of neutral alleles. Selection did not
act frequently or strongly enough to influence rates of evolution or
levels of polymorphism.

 
Initially, a wide variety of observations seemed to be consistent with
the neutral theory. Eventually, however, several lines of evidence
toppled it. There is less variation in natural populations than
the neutral theory predicts. Also, there is too much variance in
rates of substitutions in different lineages to be explained by
mutation and drift alone. Finally, selection itself has been shown to
have an impact on levels of nucleotide variation. Currently, there is
no comprehensive mathematical theory of evolution that
accurately predicts rates of evolution and levels of heterozygosity
in natural populations.

 Evolution Among Lineages 

 The Pattern of Macroevolution 

 
Evolution is not progress. The popular notion that evolution can be
represented as a series of improvements from simple cells, through
more complex life forms, to humans (the pinnacle of evolution), can
be traced to the concept of the scale of nature. This view is
incorrect.

 
All species have descended from a common ancestor. As time went
on, different lineages of organisms were modified with descent to
adapt to their environments. Thus, evolution is best viewed as a
branching tree or bush, with the tips of each branch representing
currently living species. No living organisms today are our
ancestors. Every living species is as fully modern as we are with its
own unique evolutionary history. No extant species are "lower life
forms," atavistic stepping stones paving the road to humanity.

 
A related, and common, fallacy about evolution is that humans
evolved from some living species of ape. This is not the case --
humans and apes share a common ancestor. Both humans and
living apes are fully modern species; the ancestor we evolved from
was an ape, but it is now extinct and was not the same as present
day apes (or humans for that matter). If it were not for the vanity
of human beings, we would be classified as an ape. Our closest
relatives are, collectively, the chimpanzee and the pygmy chimp.
Our next nearest relative is the gorilla.


 
 Evidence for Common Descent and Macroevolution 
 

 
Microevolution can be studied directly. Macroevolution cannot.
Macroevolution is studied by examining patterns in biological
populations and groups of related organisms and inferring process
from pattern. Given the observation of microevolution and the
knowledge that the earth is billions of years old -- macroevolution
could be postulated. But this extrapolation, in and of itself, does
not provide a compelling explanation of the patterns of biological
diversity we see today. Evidence for macroevolution, or common
ancestry and modification with descent, comes from several other
fields of study. These include: comparative biochemical and genetic
studies, comparative developmental biology, patterns of
biogeography, comparative morphology and anatomy and the fossil
record.

 
Closely related species (as determined by morphologists) have
similar gene sequences. Overall sequence similarity is not the
whole story, however. The pattern of differences we see in closely
related genomes is worth examining.

 
All living organisms use DNA as their genetic material, although
some viruses use RNA. DNA is composed of strings of nucleotides.
There are four different kinds of nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine
(G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T). Genes are sequences of nucleotides
that code for proteins. Within a gene, each block of three nucleotides
is called a codon. Each codon designates an amino acid (the subunits
of proteins).

 
The three letter code is the same for all organisms (with a few
exceptions). There are 64 codons, but only 20 amino acids to code
for; so, most amino acids are coded for by several codons. In many
cases the first two nucleotides in the codon designate the amino
acid. The third position can have any of the four nucleotides and
not effect how the code is translated.

 
A gene, when in use, is transcribed into RNA -- a nucleic acid
similar to DNA. (RNA, like DNA, is made up of nucleotides although t
he nucleotide uracil (U) is used in place of thymine (T).) The RNA
transcribed from a gene is called messenger RNA. Messenger RNA
is then translated via cellular machinery called ribosomes into
a string of amino acids -- a protein. Some proteins function as
enzymes, catalysts that speed the chemical reactions in cells.
Others are structural or involved in regulating development.

 
Gene sequences in closely related species are very similar. Often,
the same codon specifies a given amino acid in two related species,
even though alternate codons could serve functionally as well. But,
some differences do exist in gene sequences. Most often, differences
are in third codon positions, where changes in the DNA sequence would
not disrupt the sequence of the protein.

 
There are other sites in the genome where nucleotide differences do not
effect protein sequences. The genome of eukaryotes is loaded with 'dead
genes' called pseudogenes. Pseudogenes are copies of working genes
that have been inactivated by mutation. Most pseudogenes do not
produce full proteins. They may be transcribed, but not translated.
Or, they may be translated, but only a truncated protein is produced.
Pseudogenes evolve much faster than their working counterparts.
Mutations in them do not get incorporated into proteins, so they have
no effect on the fitness of an organism.

 
Introns are sequences of DNA that interrupt a gene, but do not code
for anything. The coding portions of a gene are called exons. Introns
are spliced out of the messenger RNA prior to translation, so they
do not contribute information needed to make the protein. They are
sometimes, however, involved in regulation of the gene. Like
pseudogenes, introns (in general) evolve faster than coding
portions of a gene.

 
Nucleotide positions that can be changed without changing the sequence
of a protein are called silent sites. Sites where changes result in
an amino acid substitution are called replacement sites. Silent sites
are expected to be more polymorphic within a population and show more
differences between populations. Although both silent and replacement
sites receive the same amount of mutations, natural selection only
infrequently allows changes at replacement sites. Silent sites,
however, are not as constrained.

 
Kreitman was the first demonstrate that silent sites were more
variable than coding sites. Shortly after the methods of DNA
sequencing were discovered, he sequenced 11 alleles of the enzyme
alcohol dehydrogenase (AdH). Of the 43 polymorphic nucleotide sites
he found, only one resulted in a change in the amino acid sequence
of the protein.

 
Silent sites may not be entirely selectively neutral. Some DNA
sequences are involved with regulation of genes, changes in these
sites may be deleterious. Likewise, although several codons code
for a single amino acid, an organism may have a preferred codon
for each amino acid. This is called codon bias.

 
If two species shared a recent common ancestor one would expect
genetic information, even information such as redundant
nucleotides and the position of introns or pseudogenes, to be
similar. Both species would have inherited this information from
their common ancestor.

 
The degree of similarity in nucleotide sequence is a function of
divergence time. If two populations had recently separated, few
differences would have built up between them. If they separated
long ago, each population would have evolved numerous differences
from their common ancestor (and each other). The degree of
similarity would also be a function of silent versus replacement
sites. Li and Graur, in their molecular evolution text, give the
rates of evolution for silent vs. replacement rates. The rates
were estimated from sequence comparisons of 30 genes from humans
and rodents, which diverged about 80 million years ago. Silent sites
evolved at an average rate of 4.61 nucleotide substitution per site per
10 9 years. Replacement sites evolved much slower at an
average rate of 0.85 nucleotide substitutions per site per
10 9 years.

 
Groups of related organisms are 'variations on a theme' -- the same
set of bones are used to construct all vertebrates. The bones of the
human hand grow out of the same tissue as the bones of a bat's wing
or a whale's flipper; and, they share many identifying features such
as muscle insertion points and ridges. The only difference is that they
are scaled differently. Evolutionary biologists say this indicates
that all mammals are modified descendants of a common ancestor
which had the same set of bones.

 
Closely related organisms share similar developmental pathways.
The differences in development are most evident at the end. As
organisms evolve, their developmental pathway gets modified. An
alteration near the end of a developmental pathway is less likely to
be deleterious than changes in early development. Changes early
on may have a cascading effect. Thus most evolutionary changes in
development are expected to take place at the periphery of
development, or in early aspects of development that have no later
repercussions. For a change in early development to be propagated,
the benefit of the early alteration must outweigh the consequences
to later development.

 
Because they have evolved this way, organisms pass through the
early stages of development that their ancestors passed through up
to the point of divergence. So, an organism's development mimics
its ancestors although it doesn't recreate it exactly. Development of
the flatfish, Pleuronectes, illustrates this point. Early on,
Pleuronectes develops a tail that comes to a point. In the next
developmental stage, the top lobe of the tail is larger than the
bottom lobe (as in sharks). When development is complete, the
upper and lower lobes are equally sized. This developmental
pattern mirrors the evolutionary transitions it has undergone.

 
Natural selection can modify any stage of a life cycle, so some
differences are seen in early development. Thus, evolution does not
always recapitulate ancestral forms -- butterflies did not evolve
from ancestral caterpillars, for example. There are differences in
the appearance of early vertebrate embryos. Amphibians rapidly
form a ball of cells in early development. Birds, reptiles and
mammals form a disk. The shape of the early embryo is a result of
different yolk concentrations in the eggs. Birds' and reptiles' eggs
are heavily yolked. Their eggs develop similarly to amphibians
except the yolk has deformed the shape of the embryo. The ball is
stretched out and lying atop the yolk. Mammals have no yolk, but
still form a disk early. This is because they have descended from
reptiles. Mammals lost their yolky eggs, but retained the early
pattern of development. In all these vertebrates, the pattern of cell
movements is similar despite superficial differences in appearance.
In addition, all types quickly converge upon a primitive, fish-like
stage within a few days. From there, development diverges.

 
Traces of an organism's ancestry sometimes remain even when an
organism's development is complete. These are called vestigial
structures. Many snakes have rudimentary pelvic bones retained
from their walking ancestors. Vestigial does not mean useless,
it means the structure is clearly a vestige of an structure
inherited from ancestral organisms. Vestigial structures may
acquire new functions. In humans, the appendix now houses some
immune system cells.

 
Closely related organisms are usually found in close geographic
proximity; this is especially true of organisms with limited
dispersal opportunities. The mammalian fauna of Australia is often
cited as an example of this; marsupial mammals fill most of the
equivalent niches that placentals fill in other ecosystems. If all
organisms descended from a common ancestor, species distribution
across the planet would be a function of site of origination,
potential for dispersal, distribution of suitable habitat, and
time since origination. In the case of Australian mammals, their
physical separation from sources of placentals means potential
niches were filled by a marsupial radiation rather than a
placental radiation or invasion.

 
Natural selection can only mold available genetically based
variation. In addition, natural selection provides no mechanism for
advance planning. If selection can only tinker with the available
genetic variation, we should expect to see examples of jury-rigged
design in living species. This is indeed the case. In lizards of the
genus Cnemodophorus , females reproduce parthenogenetically.
Fertility in these lizards is increased when a female mounts
another female and simulates copulation. These lizards evolved from
sexual lizards whose hormones were aroused by sexual behavior. Now,
although the sexual mode of reproduction has been lost, the means
of getting aroused (and hence fertile) has been retained.

 
Fossils show hard structures of organisms less and less similar to
modern organisms in progressively older rocks. In addition, patterns
of biogeography apply to fossils as well as extant organisms. When
combined with plate tectonics, fossils provide evidence of distributions
and dispersals of ancient species. For example, South America had a
very distinct marsupial mammalian fauna until the land bridge formed
between North and South America. After that marsupials started
disappearing and placentals took their place. This is commonly
interpreted as the placentals wiping out the marsupials, but this
may be an over simplification.

 
Transitional fossils between groups have been found. One of the
most impressive transitional series is the ancient reptile to modern
mammal transition. Mammals and reptiles differ in skeletal details,
especially in their skulls. Reptilian jaws have four bones. The
foremost is called the dentary. In mammals, the dentary bone is
the only bone in the lower jaw. The other bones are part of the
middle ear. Reptiles have a weak jaw and a mouthful of
undifferentiated teeth. Their jaw is closed by three muscles: the
external, posterior and internal adductor. Each reptile tooth is
single cusped. Mammals have powerful jaws with differentiated
teeth. Many of these teeth, such as the molars, are multi-cusped.
The temporalis and masseter muscles, derived from the external
adductor, close the mammalian jaw. Mammals have a secondary
palate, a bony structure separating their nostril passages and
throat, so most can swallow and breathe simultaneously. Reptiles
lack this.

 
The evolution of these traits can be seen in a series of fossils.
 Procynosuchus shows an increase in size of the dentary
bone and the beginnings of a palate. Thrinaxodon has a reduced
number of incisors, a precursor to tooth differentiation.
 Cynognathus (a doglike carnivore) shows a further increase in
size of the dentary bone. The other three bones are located inside
the back portion of the jaw. Some teeth are multicusped and the
teeth fit together tightly. Diademodon (a plant eater) shows a
more advanced degree of occlusion (teeth fitting tightly).
 Probelesodon has developed a double joint in the jaw. The jaw
could hinge off two points with the upper skull. The front hinge
was probably the actual hinge while the rear hinge was an
alignment guide. The forward movement of a hinge point allowed
for the precursor to the modern masseter muscle to anchor further
forward in the jaw. This allowed for a more powerful bite. The first
true mammal was Morgonucudon , a rodent-like insectivore from
the late Triassic. It had all the traits common to modern mammals.
These species were not from a single, unbranched lineage. Each is
an example from a group of organisms along the main line of
mammalian ancestry.

 
The strongest evidence for macroevolution comes from the fact
that suites of traits in biological entities fall into a nested pattern.
For example, plants can be divided into two broad categories, non-
vascular (ex. mosses) and vascular. Vascular plants can be divided
into seedless (ex. ferns) and seeded. Vascular seeded plants can be
divided into gymnosperms (ex. pines) and flowering plants (angiosperms).
Angiosperms can be divided into monocots and dicots. Each of these
types of plants have several characters that distinguish them
from other plants. Traits are not mixed and matched in groups
of organisms. For example, flowers are only seen in plants that
carry several other characters that distinguish them as
angiosperms. This is the expected pattern of common descent. All
the species in a group will share traits they inherited from their
common ancestor. But, each subgroup will have evolved unique traits
of its own. Similarities bind groups together. Differences show how
they are subdivided.

 
The real test of any scientific theory is its ability to generate
testable predictions and, of course, have the predictions borne out.
Evolution easily meets this criterion. In several of the above
examples I stated, closely related organisms share X. If I define
closely related as sharing X, this is an empty statement. It does
however, provide a prediction. If two organisms share a similar
anatomy, one would then predict that their gene sequences would
be more similar than a morphologically distinct organism. This has
been spectacularly borne out by the recent flood of gene sequences
-- the correspondence to trees drawn by morphological data is
very high. The discrepancies are never too great and usually
confined to cases where the pattern of relationship was debated.

 Mechanisms of Macroevolution 

 
The following deals with mechanisms of evolution above the
species level.

  Speciation -- Increasing Biological Diversity 

 
Speciation is the process of a single species becoming two or more
species. Many biologists think speciation is key to understanding
evolution. Some would argue that certain evolutionary phenomena apply
only at speciation and macroevolutionary change cannot occur without
speciation. Other biologists think major evolutionary change can
occur without speciation. Changes between lineages are only an
extension of the changes within each lineage. In general,
paleontologists fall into the former category and geneticists in the
latter.


  Modes of Speciation 

 
Biologists recognize two types of speciation: allopatric and
sympatric speciation. The two differ in geographical distribution of
the populations in question. Allopatric speciation is thought to be
the most common form of speciation. It occurs when a population is
split into two (or more) geographically isolated subdivisions that
organisms cannot bridge. Eventually, the two populations' gene
pools change independently until they could not interbreed even if
they were brought back together. In other words, they have
speciated.

 
Sympatric speciation occurs when two subpopulations become
reproductively isolated without first becoming geographically
isolated. Insects that live on a single host plant provide a model for
sympatric speciation. If a group of insects switched host plants
they would not breed with other members of their species still
living on their former host plant. The two subpopulations could
diverge and speciate. Agricultural records show that a strain of the
apple maggot fly Rhagolettis pomenella began infesting apples in
the 1860's. Formerly it had only infested hawthorn fruit. Feder,
Chilcote and Bush have shown that two races of Rhagolettis
pomenella have become behaviorally isolated. Allele frequencies
at six loci (aconitase 2, malic enzyme, mannose phosphate
isomerase, aspartate amino-transferase, NADH-diaphorase-2, and
beta-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase) are diverging. Significant
amounts of linkage disequilibrium have been found at these loci,
indicating that they may all be hitchhiking on some allele under
selection. Some biologists call sympatric speciation microallopatric
speciation to emphasize that the subpopulations are still physically
separate at an ecological level.

 
Biologists know little about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.
Some think a series of small changes in each subdivision gradually
lead to speciation. The founder effect could set the stage for
relatively rapid speciation, a genetic revolution in Ernst Mayr's
terms. Alan Templeton hypothesized that a few key genes
could change and confer reproductive isolation. He called this a
genetic transilience. Lynn Margulis thinks most speciation events
are caused by changes in internal symbionts. Populations of
organisms are very complicated. It is likely that there are many
ways speciation can occur. Thus, all of the above ideas may be
correct, each in different circumstances. Darwin's book was titled
"The Origin of Species" despite the fact that he did not really
address this question; over one hundred and fifty years later, how
species originate is still largely a mystery.

  Observed Speciations 

 
Speciation has been observed. In the plant genus Tragopogon , two
new species have evolved within the past 50-60 years. They are T.
mirus and T. miscellus . The new species were formed when one
diploid species fertilized a different diploid species and produced
a tetraploid offspring. This tetraploid offspring could not fertilize
or be fertilized by either of its two parent species types. It is
reproductively isolated, the definition of a species.

  Extinction -- Decreasing Biological Diversity 

  Ordinary Extinction 

 
Extinction is the ultimate fate of all species. The reasons for
extinction are numerous. A species can be competitively excluded
by a closely related species, the habitat a species lives in can
disappear and/or the organisms that the species exploits could
come up with an unbeatable defense.

 
Some species enjoy a long tenure on the planet while others are
short- lived. Some biologists believe species are programmed to
go extinct in a manner analogous to organisms being destined to
die. The majority, however, believe that if the environment stays
fairly constant, a well adapted species could continue to survive
indefinitely.

  Mass Extinction 

 
Mass extinctions shape the overall pattern of macroevolution. If
you view evolution as a branching tree, it's best to picture it as one
that has been severely pruned a few times in its life. The history of
life on this earth includes many episodes of mass extinction in
which many groups of organisms were wiped off the face of the
planet. Mass extinctions are followed by periods of radiation where
new species evolve to fill the empty niches left behind. It is
probable that surviving a mass extinction is largely a function of
luck. Thus, contingency plays a large role in patterns of
macroevolution.

 
The largest mass extinction came at the end of the Permian, about
250 million years ago. This coincides with the formation of Pangaea
II, when all the world's continents were brought together by plate
tectonics. A worldwide drop in sea level also occurred at this time.

 
The most well-known extinction occurred at the boundary between
the Cretaceous and Tertiary Periods. This called the K/T Boundary
and is dated at around 65 million years ago. This extinction
eradicated the dinosaurs. The K/T event was probably caused by
environmental disruption brought on by a large impact of an
asteroid with the earth. Following this extinction the mammalian
radiation occurred. Mammals coexisted for a long time with the
dinosaurs but were confined mostly to nocturnal insectivore niches.
With the eradication of the dinosaurs, mammals radiated to fill the
vacant niches.

 
Currently, human alteration of the ecosphere is causing a global
mass extinction.

 
  Punctuated Equilibrium 
 

 
The theory of punctuated equilibrium is an inference about the
process of macroevolution from the pattern of species documented
in the fossil record. In the fossil record, transition from one species
to another is usually abrupt in most geographic locales -- no
transitional forms are found. In short, it appears that species
remain unchanged for long stretches of time and then are quickly
replaced by new species. However, if wide ranges are searched,
transitional forms that bridge the gap between the two species are
sometimes found in small, localized areas. For example, in Jurassic
brachiopods of the genus Kutchithyris , K. acutiplicata appears
below another species, K. euryptycha . Both species were common
and covered a wide geographical area. They differ enough that
some have argued they should be in a different genera. In just one
small locality an approximately 1.25m sedimentary layer with
these fossils is found. In the narrow (10 cm) layer that separates
the two species, both species are found along with transitional
forms. In other localities there is a sharp transition.

 
Eldredge and Gould proposed that most major morphological change
occurs (relatively) quickly in small peripheral population at
the time of speciation. New forms will then invade the range of
their ancestral species. Thus, at most locations that fossils are
found, transition from one species to another will be abrupt. This
abrupt change will reflect replacement by migration however, not
evolution. In order to find the transitional fossils, the area of
speciation must be found.

 
There has been considerable confusion about the theory. Some
popular accounts give the impression that abrupt changes in the
fossil record are due to blindingly fast evolution; this is not a part
of the theory.

 
Punctuated equilibrium has been presented as a hierarchical
theory of evolution. Proponents of punctuated equilibrium see
speciation as analogous to mutation and the replacement of one
species by another as analogous to natural selection. This is called
species selection. Speciation adds new species to the species pool
just as mutation adds new alleles to the gene pool. Species selection
favors one species over another just as natural selection can favor
one allele over another. Evolutionary trends within a group would be
the result of selection among species, not natural selection acting
within species. This is the most controversial part of the theory.
Many biologists agree with the pattern of macroevolution these
paleontologists posit, but believe species selection is not even
theoretically likely to occur.

 
Critics would argue that species selection is not analogous to natural
selection and therefore evolution is not hierarchical. Also, the number
of species produced over time is far less than the amount of different
alleles that enter gene pools over time. So, the amount of adaptive
evolution produced by species selection (if it did occur) would have
to be orders of magnitude less than adaptive evolution within
populations by natural selection.

 
Tests of punctuated equilibrium have been equivocal. It has been
known for a long time that rates of evolution vary over time, that
is not controversial. However, phylogenetic studies conflict as to
whether there is a clear association between speciation and
morphological change. In addition, there are major polymorphisms
within some species. For example, bluegill sunfish have two male
morphs. One is a large, long-lived, mate-protecting male; the
other is a smaller, shorter-lived male who sneaks matings from
females guarded by large males. The existence of within species
polymorphisms demonstrates that speciation is not a requirement
for major morphological change.

 
 A Brief History of Life 
 

 
Biologists studying evolution do a variety of things: population
geneticists study the process as it is occurring; systematists seek to
determine relationships between species and paleontologists seek
to uncover details of the unfolding of life in the past. Discerning
these details is often difficult, but hypotheses can be made and
tested as new evidence comes to light. This section should be
viewed as the best hypothesis scientists have as to the history of the
planet. The material here ranges from some issues that are fairly
certain to some topics that are nothing more than informed
speculation. For some points there are opposing hypotheses -- I
have tried to compile a consensus picture. In general, the more
remote the time, the more likely the story is incomplete or in error.

 
Life evolved in the sea. It stayed there for the majority of the
history of earth.

 
The first replicating molecules were most likely RNA. RNA is a
nucleic acid similar to DNA. In laboratory studies it has been shown
that some RNA sequences have catalytic capabilities. Most
importantly, certain RNA sequences act as polymerases -- enzymes
that form strands of RNA from its monomers. This process of self
replication is the crucial step in the formation of life. This is called
the RNA world hypothesis.

 
The common ancestor of all life probably used RNA as its genetic
material. This ancestor gave rise to three major lineages of life.
These are: the prokaryotes ("ordinary" bacteria), archaebacteria
(thermophilic, methanogenic and halophilic bacteria) and
eukaryotes. Eukaryotes include protists (single celled organisms
like amoebas and diatoms and a few multicellular forms such as
kelp), fungi (including mushrooms and yeast), plants and animals.
Eukaryotes and archaebacteria are the two most closely related of
the three. The process of translation (making protein from the
instructions on a messenger RNA template) is similar in these
lineages, but the organization of the genome and transcription
(making messenger RNA from a DNA template) is very different in
prokaryotes than in eukaryotes and archaebacteria. Scientists
interpret this to mean that the common ancestor was RNA based; it
gave rise to two lineages that independently formed a DNA genome
and hence independently evolved mechanisms to transcribe DNA
into RNA.

 
The first cells must have been anaerobic because there was no
oxygen in the atmosphere. In addition, they were probably
thermophilic ("heat-loving") and fermentative. Rocks as old as 3.5
billion years old have yielded prokaryotic fossils. Specifically, some
rocks from Australia called the Warrawoona series give evidence of
bacterial communities organized into structures called
stromatolites. Fossils like these have subsequently been found all
over the world. These mats of bacteria still form today in a few
locales (for example, Shark Bay Australia). Bacteria are the only life
forms found in the rocks for a long, long time --eukaryotes (protists)
appear about 1.5 billion years ago and fungi-like things appear
about 900 million years ago (0.9 billion years ago).

 
Photosynthesis evolved around 3.4 billion years ago.
Photosynthesis is a process that allows organisms to harness
sunlight to manufacture sugar from simpler precursors. The first
photosystem to evolve, PSI, uses light to convert carbon dioxide
(CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to glucose. This process releases
sulfur as a waste product. About a billion years later, a second
photosystem (PS) evolved, probably from a duplication of the first
photosystem. Organisms with PSII use both photosystems in
conjunction to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into
glucose. This process releases oxygen as a waste product.
Anoxygenic (or H2S) photosynthesis, using PSI, is seen in living
purple and green bacteria. Oxygenic (or H2O) photosynthesis, using
PSI and PSII, takes place in cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are
closely related to and hence probably evolved from purple
bacterial ancestors. Green bacteria are an outgroup. Since oxygenic
bacteria are a lineage within a cluster of anoxygenic lineages,
scientists infer that PSI evolved first. This also corroborates with
geological evidence.

 
Green plants and algae also use both photosystems. In these
organisms, photosynthesis occurs in organelles (membrane bound
structures within the cell) called chloroplasts. These organelles
originated as free living bacteria related to the cyanobacteria that
were engulfed by ur-eukaryotes and eventually entered into an
endosymbiotic relationship. This endosymbiotic theory of
eukaryotic organelles was championed by Lynn Margulis.
Originally controversial, this theory is now accepted. One key line
of evidence in support of this idea came when the DNA inside
chloroplasts was sequenced -- the gene sequences were more
similar to free-living cyanobacteria sequences than to sequences
from the plants the chloroplasts resided in.

 
After the advent of photosystem II, oxygen levels increased.
Dissolved oxygen in the oceans increased as well as atmospheric
oxygen. This is sometimes called the oxygen holocaust. Oxygen is a
very good electron acceptor and can be very damaging to living
organisms. Many bacteria are anaerobic and die almost
immediately in the presence of oxygen. Other organisms, like
animals, have special ways to avoid cellular damage due to this
element (and in fact require it to live.) Initially, when oxygen
began building up in the environment, it was neutralized by
materials already present. Iron, which existed in high
concentrations in the sea was oxidized and precipitated. Evidence
of this can be seen in banded iron formations from this time, layers
of iron deposited on the sea floor. As one geologist put it, "the
world rusted." Eventually, it grew to high enough concentrations to
be dangerous to living things. In response, many species went
extinct, some continued (and still continue) to thrive in anaerobic
microenvironments and several lineages independently evolved
oxygen respiration.

 
The purple bacteria evolved oxygen respiration by reversing the
flow of molecules through their carbon fixing pathways and
modifying their electron transport chains. Purple bacteria also
enabled the eukaryotic lineage to become aerobic. Eukaryotic cells
have membrane bound organelles called mitochondria that take
care of respiration for the cell. These are endosymbionts like
chloroplasts. Mitochondria formed this symbiotic relationship
very early in eukaryotic history, all but a few groups of eukaryotic
cells have mitochondria. Later, a few lineages picked up
chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have multiple origins. Red algae picked
up ur-chloroplasts from the cyanobacterial lineage. Green algae, the
group plants evolved from, picked up different urchloroplasts from
a prochlorophyte, a lineage closely related to cyanobacteria.

 
Animals start appearing prior to the Cambrian, about 600 million
years ago. The first animals dating from just before the Cambrian
were found in rocks near Adelaide, Australia. They are called the
Ediacarian fauna and have subsequently been found in other
locales as well. It is unclear if these forms have any surviving
descendants. Some look a bit like Cnidarians (jellyfish, sea
anemones and the like); others resemble annelids (earthworms).
All the phyla (the second highest taxonomic category) of animals
appeared around the Cambrian. The Cambrian 'explosion' may have
been a result of higher oxygen concentrations enabling larger
organisms with higher metabolisms to evolve. Or it might be due to
the spreading of shallow seas at that time providing a variety of
new niches. In any case, the radiation produced a wide variety of
animals.

 
Some paleontologists think more animal phyla were present then
than now. The animals of the Burgess shale are an example of
Cambrian animal fossils. These fossils, from Canada, show a bizarre
array of creatures, some which appear to have unique body plans
unlike those seen in any living animals.

 
The extent of the Cambrian explosion is often overstated. Although
quick, the Cambrian explosion is not instantaneous in geologic time.
Also, there is evidence of animal life prior to the Cambrian. In
addition, although all the phyla of animals came into being, these
were not the modern forms we see today. Our own phylum
(which we share with other mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians
and fish) was represented by a small, sliver-like thing called
 Pikaia . Plants were not yet present. Photosynthetic protists and
algae were the bottom of the food chain. Following the Cambrian,
the number of marine families leveled off at a little less than 200.

 
The Ordovician explosion, around 500 million years ago, followed.
This 'explosion', larger than the Cambrian, introduced numerous
families of the Paleozoic fauna (including crinoids,
articulate brachiopods, cephalopods and corals). The Cambrian
fauna, (trilobites, inarticulate brachiopods, etc.) declined slowly
during this time. By the end of the Ordovician, the Cambrian fauna
had mostly given way to the Paleozoic fauna and the number of
marine families was just over 400. It stayed at this level until the
end of the Permian period.

 
Plants evolved from ancient green algae over 400 million years
ago. Both groups use chlorophyll a and b as photosynthetic
pigments. In addition, plants and green algae are the only groups
to store starch in their chloroplasts. Plants and fungi (in symbiosis)
invaded the land about 400 million years ago. The first plants
were moss-like and required moist environments to survive. Later,
evolutionary developments such as a waxy cuticle allowed some
plants to exploit more inland environments. Still mosses lack true
vascular tissue to transport fluids and nutrients. This limits their
size since these must diffuse through the plant. Vascular plants
evolved from mosses. The first vascular land plant known is
 Cooksonia , a spiky, branching, leafless structure. At the same
time, or shortly thereafter, arthropods followed plants onto the
land. The first land animals known are myriapods -- centipedes
and millipedes.

 
Vertebrates moved onto the land by the Devonian period, about
380 million years ago. Ichthyostega , an amphibian, is the among
the first known land vertebrates. It was found in Greenland and
was derived from lobe-finned fishes called Rhipidistians.
Amphibians gave rise to reptiles. Reptiles had evolved scales to
decrease water loss and a shelled egg permitting young to be
hatched on land. Among the earliest well preserved reptiles
is Hylonomus , from rocks in Nova Scotia.

 
The Permian extinction was the largest extinction in history. It
happened about 250 million years ago. The last of the Cambrian
Fauna went extinct. The Paleozoic fauna took a nose dive from
about 300 families to about 50. It is estimated that 96% of all
species (50% of all Families) met their end. Following this event,
the Modern fauna, which had been slowly expanding since the
Ordovician, took over.

 
The Modern fauna includes fish, bivalves, gastropods and crabs.
These were barely affected by the Permian extinction. The Modern
fauna subsequently increased to over 600 marine families at
present. The Paleozoic fauna held steady at about 100 families. A
second extinction event shortly following the Permian kept animal
diversity low for awhile.

 
During the Carboniferous (the period just prior to the Permian) and
in the Permian the landscape was dominated by ferns and their
relatives. After the Permian extinction, gymnosperms (ex. pines)
became more abundant. Gymnosperms had evolved seeds, from
seedless fern ancestors, which helped their ability to disperse.
Gymnosperms also evolved pollen, encased sperm which allowed
for more outcrossing.

 
Dinosaurs evolved from archosaur reptiles, their closest living
relatives are crocodiles. One modification that may have been a key
to their success was the evolution of an upright stance. Amphibians
and reptiles have a splayed stance and walk with an undulating
pattern because their limbs are modified from fins. Their gait is
modified from the swimming movement of fish. Splay stanced
animals cannot sustain continued locomotion because they cannot
breathe while they move; their undulating movement compresses
their chest cavity. Thus, they must stop every few steps and breath
before continuing on their way. Dinosaurs evolved an upright
stance similar to the upright stance mammals independently
evolved. This allowed for continual locomotion. In addition,
dinosaurs evolved to be warm-blooded. Warmbloodedness allows
an increase in the vigor of movements in erect organisms. Splay
stanced organisms would probably not benefit from warm-
bloodedness. Birds evolved from sauriscian dinosaurs.
Cladistically, birds are dinosaurs. The transitional fossil
 Archaeopteryx has a mixture of reptilian and avian features.

 
Angiosperms evolved from gymnosperms, their closest relatives
are Gnetae. Two key adaptations allowed them to displace
gymnosperms as the dominant fauna -- fruits and flowers. Fruits
(modified plant ovaries) allow for animal-based seed dispersal and
deposition with plenty of fertilizer. Flowers evolved to facilitate
animal, especially insect, based pollen dispersal. Petals are
modified leaves. Angiosperms currently dominate the flora of the
world -- over three fourths of all living plants are angiosperms.

 
Insects evolved from primitive segmented arthropods. The mouth parts of
insects are modified legs. Insects are closely related to annelids.
Insects dominate the fauna of the world. Over half of all named
species are insects. One third of this number are beetles.

 
The end of the Cretaceous, about 65 million years ago, is marked by
a minor mass extinction. This extinction marked the demise of all
the lineages of dinosaurs save the birds. Up to this point mammals
were confined to nocturnal, insectivorous niches. Once the
dinosaurs were out of the picture, they diversified.
 Morgonucudon , a contemporary of dinosaurs, is an example of
one of the first mammals. Mammals evolved from therapsid
reptiles. The finback reptile Diametrodon is an example of a
therapsid. One of the most successful lineages of mammals is, of
course, humans. Humans are neotenous apes. Neoteny is a process
which leads to an organism reaching reproductive capacity in its
juvenile form. The primary line of evidence for this is the
similarities between young apes and adult humans. Louis Bolk
compiled a list of 25 features shared between adult humans and
juvenile apes, including facial morphology, high relative brain
weight, absence of brow ridges and cranial crests.

 
The earth has been in a state of flux for 4 billion years. Across this
time, the abundance of different lineages varies wildly. New
lineages evolve and radiate out across the face of the planet,
pushing older lineages to extinction, or relictual existence in
protected refugia or suitable microhabitats. Organisms modify
their environments. This can be disastrous, as in the case of the
oxygen holocaust. However, environmental modification can be
the impetus for further evolutionary change. Overall, diversity has
increased since the beginning of life. This increase is, however,
interrupted numerous times by mass extinctions. Diversity appears
to have hit an all-time high just prior to the appearance of humans.
As the human population has increased, biological diversity has
decreased at an ever-increasing pace. The correlation is probably
causal.

 Scientific Standing of Evolution and its Critics 

 
The theory of evolution and common descent were once controversial
in scientific circles. This is no longer the case. Debates
continue about how various aspects of evolution work. For
example, all the details of patterns of relationships are not fully
worked out. However, evolution and common descent are
considered fact by the scientific community.

 
Scientific creationism is 100% crap. So-called "scientific"
creationists do not base their objections on scientific reasoning or
data. Their ideas are based on religious dogma, and their approach is
simply to attack evolution. The types of arguments they use fall into
several categories: distortions of scientific principles ( the second law of thermodynamics
argument ), straw man versions of evolution ( the "too improbable to
evolve by chance" argument ), dishonest selective use of data ( the declining speed of light argument )
appeals to emotion or wishful thinking ("I don't want to be related to
an ape"), appeals to personal incredulity ("I don't see how this could
have evolved"), dishonestly quoting scientists out of context ( Darwin's comments on the evolution of
the eye ) and simply fabricating data to suit their arguments ( Gish's "bullfrog proteins" ).

 
Most importantly, scientific creationists do not have a testable,
scientific theory to replace evolution with. Even if evolution turned
out to be wrong, it would simply be replaced by another scientific
theory. Creationists do not conduct scientific experiments, nor do
they seek publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Much
of their output is "preaching to the choir."

 
The most persuasive creationist argument is a non-scientific
one -- the appeal to fair play. "Shouldn't we present both sides of
the argument?," they ask. The answer is no -- the fair thing to do
is exclude scientific creationism from public school science
courses. Scientists have studied and tested evolution for 150
years. There is voluminous evidence for it. Within the scientific
community, there are no competing theories. Until scientific
creationists formulate a scientific theory, and submit it for
testing, they have no right to demand equal time in science class
to present their ideas. Evolution has earned a place in the science
curriculum. Creationism has not.

 
Science is based on an open and honest look at the data. Much of
creationism is built on dishonest debating techniques and special
pleading for a case the data does not support. Science belongs in
science classes. Evolution is science. Creationism is not. It's that
simple.

 
The creationist attack on public school education means that school
children are denied the possibility of learning about the most
powerful and elegant theory in biology. Politicians are willing to
allow the scientifically ignorant, but politically strong, to wreck the
educational system in exchange for votes. People interested in
evolution, and science education in general, need to closely watch
school board elections. Creationist "stealth" candidates have been
elected in several regions. Thankfully, many have been voted out
once their views became apparent.

 
The majority of Americans are religious, but only a minority are
religious nuts. The version of religion the far right wants to impose
on America is as repulsive to most mainstream Christians as it is to
members of other religions, atheists and agnostics. Most informed
religious people see no reason for biological facts and theories
to interfere with their religious beliefs.

 The Importance of Evolution in Biology 

 
"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." --
Theodosius Dobzhansky

 
Evolution has been called the cornerstone of biology, and for good
reasons. It is possible to do research in biology with little or no
knowledge of evolution. Most biologists do. But, without evolution
biology becomes a disparate set of fields. Evolutionary explanations
pervade all fields in biology and brings them together under one
theoretical umbrella.

 
We know from microevolutionary theory that natural selection
should optimize the existing genetic variation in a population to
maximize reproductive success. This provides a framework for
interpreting a variety of biological traits and their relative
importance. For example, a signal intended to attract a mate could
be intercepted by predators. Natural selection has caused a trade-
off between attracting mates and getting preyed upon. If you assume
something other than reproductive success is optimized, many things
in biology would make little sense. Without the theory of evolution,
life history strategies would be poorly understood.

 
Macroevolutionary theory also helps explain many things about
how living things work. Organisms are modified over time by
cumulative natural selection. The numerous examples of jury-
rigged design in nature are a direct result of this. The distribution
of genetically based traits across groups is explained by splitting of
lineages and the continued production of new traits by mutation.
The traits are restricted to the lineages they arise in.

 
Details of the past also hold explanatory power in biology. Plants
obtain their carbon by joining carbon dioxide gas to an organic
molecule within their cells. This is called carbon fixation. The
enzyme that fixes carbon is RuBP carboxlyase. Plants using C3
photosynthesis lose 1/3 to 1/2 of the carbon dioxide they
originally fix. RuBP carboxlyase works well in the absence of
oxygen, but poorly in its presence. This is because photosynthesis
evolved when there was little gaseous oxygen present. Later, when
oxygen became more abundant, the efficiency of photosynthesis
decreased. Photosynthetic organisms compensated by making more
of the enzyme. RuBP carboxylase is the most abundant protein on
the planet partially because it is one of the least efficient.

 
Ecosystems, species, organisms and their genes all have long
histories. A complete explanation of any biological trait must have
two components. First, a proximal explanation -- how does it work?
And second, an ultimate explanation -- what was it modified from?
For centuries humans have asked, "Why are we here?" The answer
to that question lies outside the realm of science. Biologists,
however, can provide an elegant answer to the question, "How did
we get here?"

																 "Latin name" redirects here. For personal names in the Roman empire, see Roman naming conventions . 
 Binomial nomenclature (also called binomi n al nomenclature or binary nomenclature ) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just "binomial"), a binomen or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. [ 1 ] 
 The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) for plants. Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules. 
 In modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text. Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii . 
 In scientific works, the "authority" for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified. 
 
 In zoology
 
 " Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758". The name "Linnaeus" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of sea snail; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book Systema Naturae ). 
 " Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)". The original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; the ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made. 
 
 
 In botany
 
 " Amaranthus retroflexus L." – "L." is the standard abbreviation used in botany for "Linnaeus". 
 " Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named this bluebell species Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides ; the ICN does not require that the dates of either publication be specified.

 [ edit ] History 
 
 
 
  
 Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778), a Swedish botanist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature. 
 
 
 See also: Biological classification#Early systems 
 Prior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long. Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature. [ 2 ] These names had two separate functions. First, to designate or label the species, and second, to be a diagnosis or description; however these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible. [ 3 ] In a simple genus, containing only two species, it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name; but as more species were discovered the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy, for instance Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti (Plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindric spike and a terete scape), which we know today as Plantago media . 
 Such "polynomial names" may sometimes look like binomials, but are significantly different. For example, Gerard's herbal describes various kinds of spiderwort: "The first is called phalangium ramosum , Branched Spiderwort; the second, phalangium non ramosum , Unbranched Spiderwort. The other ... is aptly termed phalangium ephemerum virginianum , Soone Fading Spiderwort of Virginia". [ 4 ] The Latin phrases are short descriptions, rather than identifying labels. 
 The Bauhins , in particular Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624), took some important steps towards the binomial system, by pruning the Latin descriptions, in many cases to two words. [ 5 ] The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl von Linné, more commonly known by his Latinized name Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778). It was in his 1753 Species Plantarum that he first began consistently using a one-word "trivial name" together with a generic name in a system of binomial nomenclature. [ 6 ] This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet ( ICN ) or specific name ( ICZN ). [ 6 ] The Bauhins' genus names were retained in many of these, but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word. 
 Linnaeus's trivial names introduced an important new idea, namely that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label. This meant that the name no longer need be descriptive; for example both parts could be derived from the names of people. Thus Gerard's phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana , where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the younger , [ 7 ] an English botanist and gardener. [ 8 ] A bird in the parrot family was named Psittacus alexandri , meaning "Alexander's parrot", after Alexander the Great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to Greece. [ 9 ] Linnaeus' trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names and eventually replaced them. [ 1 ] 
 [ edit ] Value 
 The value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names it generally favors: 
 
 Economy. Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced, a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember. [ 1 ] It corresponds to the widespread system of family name plus given name (s) used to name people in many cultures. [ 5 ] 
 Widespread use. The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide. [ 10 ] 
 Clarity. Binomial names avoid the confusion that can be created when attempting to use common names to refer to a species. [ 11 ] Common names often differ from one country to another, or even from one part of a country to another. In English-speaking parts of Europe, the bird called a "robin" is Erithacus rubecula . In English-speaking North America, a "robin" is Turdus migratorius . In contrast, the scientific name can be used all over the world, in all languages, avoiding confusion and difficulties of translation. [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] 
 Uniqueness. Provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species, it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code, generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species. [ 13 ] However, establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can be difficult, particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries. Therefore a species may have more than one regularly used name; these names are " synonyms ". [ 14 ] 
 Stability. Although stability is far from absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names tend to favor stability. [ 11 ] For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge), if possible the second part of the binomial is kept the same. Thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera Chionodoxa and Scilla are sufficiently different to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name Chionodoxa siehei ; those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei . [ 15 ] The siehei element is constant. Similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, where possible the second part of the binomial name is retained as the third part of the new name. Thus the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is Erithacus superbus , or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus . [ 16 ] The superbus element of the name is constant. Since taxonomists can legitimately disagree as to whether two genera or two species are distinct or not, more than one name can be in use. [ 17 ] 
 
 [ edit ] Relationship to classification and taxonomy 
 Nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification, although the two are related. Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities and/or differences; in biological classification , species are one of the kinds of item to be classified. [ 18 ] In principle, the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification. This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera. [ citation needed ] 
 Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification. Its first stages (sometimes called " alpha taxonomy ") are concerned with finding, describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms. [ 19 ] Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named. Taxonomists are also concerned with classification, including its principles, procedures and rules. [ 20 ] 
 [ edit ] Derivation of binomial names 
 See also: List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names 
 A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language (hence the common use of the term "Latin name" for a binomial name). However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include: 
 
 Latin, either classical or medieval . Thus both parts of the binomial name Homo sapiens are Latin words, meaning "wise" ( sapiens ) "human/man" ( Homo ). 
 Classical Greek . The genus Rhododendron was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word ῥοδόδενδρον , itself derived from rhodos , rose, and dendron , tree. [ 21 ] Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form. Thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name Erythroxylum coca . Erythroxylum is derived from the Greek words erythros , red, and xylon , wood. [ 22 ] The Greek neuter ending - ον (-on) is often converted to the Latin neuter ending -um. [ a ] 
 
 
 Other languages. The second part of the name Erythroxylum coca is derived from the name of the plant in the Quechua language. [ 23 ] Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use Mongolian words, e.g. Tarchia from tarkhi , meaning "brain", or Saichania meaning "beautiful one". 
 Names of people (often naturalists or biologists). The name Magnolia campbellii commemorates two people: Pierre Magnol , a French botanist, and Archibald Campbell , a doctor in British India . [ 24 ] 
 Names of places. The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum is widespread in the United States. [ 25 ] 
 Other sources. Some binominal names have been constructed from anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names. Thus the name of the genus Muilla is derived by reversing the name Allium . [ 26 ] Names may also be derived from jokes or puns. For example, Ratcliffe described a number of species of Rhinoceros beetle , including Cyclocephala nodanotherwon . [ 27 ] 
 
 The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word which can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case . It must be unique within each kingdom , but can be repeated between kingdoms. Thus Huia recurvata is an extinct species of plant, found as fossils in Yunnan , China, [ 28 ] whereas Huia masonii is a species of frog found in Java , Indonesia. [ 29 ] 
 The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms. 
 
 The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in gender . Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus . Here domesticus ("domestic") simply means "associated with the house". The sacred bamboo is Nandina domestic a  [ 30 ] rather than Nandina domestic us , since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant Lansium domestic um , since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us , -a , -um (as in the previous example of domesticus ); -is , -is , -e (e.g. tristis , meaning "sad"); and -or , -or , -us (e.g. minor , meaning "smaller"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives . 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is Panthera leo . Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine. 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii , the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii , or the Olive-backed Pipit Anthus hodgsoni . The meaning is "of the person named", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond , in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae , meaning "of the Chalumna River ". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli , where coli means "of the colon ". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum , where vesparum means "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps. 
 
 Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom. 
 [ edit ] Codes 
 From the mid-19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. In the course of time these became nomenclature codes . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) governs the naming of animals, [ 31 ] the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) that of plants (including cyanobacteria ), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( ICNB ) that of bacteria (including Archaea ). Virus names are governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.: 
 
 "Binomial nomenclature" is the correct term for botany, [ 32 ] although it is also used by zoologists. [ 33 ] Since 1953, "binomi n al nomenclature" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina). [ 34 ] 
 Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the "genus name". In zoological code ( ICZN ), the second part of the name is a "specific name", or in the botanical code ( ICN ) a "specific epithet". Together, these two parts are referred to as a "species name" or "binomen" in the zoological code; or "species name", "specific name", or a "binary combination" in the botanical code. 
 The ICN , the plant Code , does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym ), whereas the ICZN , the animal Code , does. Thus the American bison has the binomial Bison bison ; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant. 
 The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published Species Plantarum ). In zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's Systema Naturae , 10th Edition, and also Clerck's Aranei Svecici ). Bacteriology started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980. [ 35 ] 
 
 Unifying the different codes into a single code, the " BioCode ", has been suggested, although implementation is not in sight. (There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names clades . This is called the PhyloCode .) 
 [ edit ] Writing binomial names 
 By tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 36 ] Generally the binomial should be printed in a font different from that used in the normal text; for example, " Several more Homo sapiens fossils were discovered ." When handwritten, each part of a binomial name should be underlined; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 37 ] 
 The first part of the binomial, the genus name, is always written with an initial capital letter. In current usage, the second part is never written with an initial capital. [ 38 ]  [ 39 ] Older sources, particularly botanical works published before the 1950s, use a different convention. If the second part of the name is derived from a proper noun, e.g. the name of a person or place, a capital letter was used. Thus the modern form Berberis darwinii was written as Berberis Darwinii . A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g. Panthera Leo or Centaurea Cyanus . [ 40 ]  [ 41 ] 
 When used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication. [ 42 ] For example "The house sparrow ( Passer domesticus ) is decreasing in Europe." 
 The binomial name should generally be written in full. The exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report, or the same species is mentioned repeatedly; in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used, but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop). [ 43 ] For example, a list of members of the genus Canis might be written as " Canis lupus , C. aureus , C. simensis ". In rare cases, this abbreviated form has spread to more general use; for example, the bacterium Escherichia coli is often referred to as just E. coli , and Tyrannosaurus rex is perhaps even better known simply as T. rex , these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given. 
 The abbreviation "sp." is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified. The abbreviation "spp." (plural) indicates "several species". These abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined). [ 44 ] For example: " Canis sp." means "an unspecified species of the genus Canis ", while " Canis spp." means "two or more species of the genus Canis ". (The abbreviations "sp." and "spp." can easily be confused with the abbreviations "ssp." (zoology) or "subsp." (botany), plurals "sspp." or "subspp.", referring to one or more subspecies. See trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name .) 
 The abbreviation " cf. " is used when the identification is not confirmed. [ 45 ] For example " Corvus cf. splendens " indicates "a bird similar to the house crow but not certainly identified as this species". 
 In some contexts the dagger symbol ("†") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct. 
 [ edit ] Authority 
 Main articles: Author citation (zoology) and Author citation (botany) 
 In scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the "authority" – a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany: under the ICZN the surname is written in full together with the date (usually only the year) of publication, whereas under the ICN the name is generally abbreviated and the date omitted. The International Plant Names Index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too. 
 When the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both Codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ICN also requires the person who made the change to be given. Some examples: 
 
 (plant) Amaranthus retroflexus L. – "L." is the standard abbreviation for "Linnaeus"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name. 
 (plant) Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides . 
 (animal) Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) – the original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; unlike the ICN , the ICZN does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.

 Main articles: Biological nomenclature , Trinomial name , and Infraspecific name (botany) 
 Binomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g. family, order, class) receive one part names which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, Passer domesticus , belongs to the family Passeridae . Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany. 
 Ranks below species receive three part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ICZN and the ICN . In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii . In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a "connecting term" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis ; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is Cyclamen hederifolium f. albiflorum .

																 "Latin name" redirects here. For personal names in the Roman empire, see Roman naming conventions . 
 Binomial nomenclature (also called binomi n al nomenclature or binary nomenclature ) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just "binomial"), a binomen or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. [ 1 ] 
 The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) for plants. Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules. 
 In modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text. Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii . 
 In scientific works, the "authority" for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified. 
 
 In zoology
 
 " Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758". The name "Linnaeus" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of sea snail; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book Systema Naturae ). 
 " Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)". The original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; the ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made. 
 
 
 In botany
 
 " Amaranthus retroflexus L." – "L." is the standard abbreviation used in botany for "Linnaeus". 
 " Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named this bluebell species Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides ; the ICN does not require that the dates of either publication be specified.

 [ edit ] History 
 
 
 
  
 Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778), a Swedish botanist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature. 
 
 
 See also: Biological classification#Early systems 
 Prior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long. Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature. [ 2 ] These names had two separate functions. First, to designate or label the species, and second, to be a diagnosis or description; however these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible. [ 3 ] In a simple genus, containing only two species, it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name; but as more species were discovered the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy, for instance Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti (Plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindric spike and a terete scape), which we know today as Plantago media . 
 Such "polynomial names" may sometimes look like binomials, but are significantly different. For example, Gerard's herbal describes various kinds of spiderwort: "The first is called phalangium ramosum , Branched Spiderwort; the second, phalangium non ramosum , Unbranched Spiderwort. The other ... is aptly termed phalangium ephemerum virginianum , Soone Fading Spiderwort of Virginia". [ 4 ] The Latin phrases are short descriptions, rather than identifying labels. 
 The Bauhins , in particular Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624), took some important steps towards the binomial system, by pruning the Latin descriptions, in many cases to two words. [ 5 ] The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl von Linné, more commonly known by his Latinized name Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778). It was in his 1753 Species Plantarum that he first began consistently using a one-word "trivial name" together with a generic name in a system of binomial nomenclature. [ 6 ] This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet ( ICN ) or specific name ( ICZN ). [ 6 ] The Bauhins' genus names were retained in many of these, but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word. 
 Linnaeus's trivial names introduced an important new idea, namely that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label. This meant that the name no longer need be descriptive; for example both parts could be derived from the names of people. Thus Gerard's phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana , where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the younger , [ 7 ] an English botanist and gardener. [ 8 ] A bird in the parrot family was named Psittacus alexandri , meaning "Alexander's parrot", after Alexander the Great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to Greece. [ 9 ] Linnaeus' trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names and eventually replaced them. [ 1 ] 
 [ edit ] Value 
 The value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names it generally favors: 
 
 Economy. Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced, a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember. [ 1 ] It corresponds to the widespread system of family name plus given name (s) used to name people in many cultures. [ 5 ] 
 Widespread use. The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide. [ 10 ] 
 Clarity. Binomial names avoid the confusion that can be created when attempting to use common names to refer to a species. [ 11 ] Common names often differ from one country to another, or even from one part of a country to another. In English-speaking parts of Europe, the bird called a "robin" is Erithacus rubecula . In English-speaking North America, a "robin" is Turdus migratorius . In contrast, the scientific name can be used all over the world, in all languages, avoiding confusion and difficulties of translation. [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] 
 Uniqueness. Provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species, it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code, generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species. [ 13 ] However, establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can be difficult, particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries. Therefore a species may have more than one regularly used name; these names are " synonyms ". [ 14 ] 
 Stability. Although stability is far from absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names tend to favor stability. [ 11 ] For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge), if possible the second part of the binomial is kept the same. Thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera Chionodoxa and Scilla are sufficiently different to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name Chionodoxa siehei ; those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei . [ 15 ] The siehei element is constant. Similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, where possible the second part of the binomial name is retained as the third part of the new name. Thus the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is Erithacus superbus , or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus . [ 16 ] The superbus element of the name is constant. Since taxonomists can legitimately disagree as to whether two genera or two species are distinct or not, more than one name can be in use. [ 17 ] 
 
 [ edit ] Relationship to classification and taxonomy 
 Nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification, although the two are related. Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities and/or differences; in biological classification , species are one of the kinds of item to be classified. [ 18 ] In principle, the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification. This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera. [ citation needed ] 
 Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification. Its first stages (sometimes called " alpha taxonomy ") are concerned with finding, describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms. [ 19 ] Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named. Taxonomists are also concerned with classification, including its principles, procedures and rules. [ 20 ] 
 [ edit ] Derivation of binomial names 
 See also: List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names 
 A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language (hence the common use of the term "Latin name" for a binomial name). However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include: 
 
 Latin, either classical or medieval . Thus both parts of the binomial name Homo sapiens are Latin words, meaning "wise" ( sapiens ) "human/man" ( Homo ). 
 Classical Greek . The genus Rhododendron was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word ῥοδόδενδρον , itself derived from rhodos , rose, and dendron , tree. [ 21 ] Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form. Thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name Erythroxylum coca . Erythroxylum is derived from the Greek words erythros , red, and xylon , wood. [ 22 ] The Greek neuter ending - ον (-on) is often converted to the Latin neuter ending -um. [ a ] 
 
 
 Other languages. The second part of the name Erythroxylum coca is derived from the name of the plant in the Quechua language. [ 23 ] Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use Mongolian words, e.g. Tarchia from tarkhi , meaning "brain", or Saichania meaning "beautiful one". 
 Names of people (often naturalists or biologists). The name Magnolia campbellii commemorates two people: Pierre Magnol , a French botanist, and Archibald Campbell , a doctor in British India . [ 24 ] 
 Names of places. The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum is widespread in the United States. [ 25 ] 
 Other sources. Some binominal names have been constructed from anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names. Thus the name of the genus Muilla is derived by reversing the name Allium . [ 26 ] Names may also be derived from jokes or puns. For example, Ratcliffe described a number of species of Rhinoceros beetle , including Cyclocephala nodanotherwon . [ 27 ] 
 
 The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word which can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case . It must be unique within each kingdom , but can be repeated between kingdoms. Thus Huia recurvata is an extinct species of plant, found as fossils in Yunnan , China, [ 28 ] whereas Huia masonii is a species of frog found in Java , Indonesia. [ 29 ] 
 The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms. 
 
 The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in gender . Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus . Here domesticus ("domestic") simply means "associated with the house". The sacred bamboo is Nandina domestic a  [ 30 ] rather than Nandina domestic us , since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant Lansium domestic um , since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us , -a , -um (as in the previous example of domesticus ); -is , -is , -e (e.g. tristis , meaning "sad"); and -or , -or , -us (e.g. minor , meaning "smaller"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives . 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is Panthera leo . Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine. 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii , the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii , or the Olive-backed Pipit Anthus hodgsoni . The meaning is "of the person named", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond , in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae , meaning "of the Chalumna River ". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli , where coli means "of the colon ". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum , where vesparum means "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps. 
 
 Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom. 
 [ edit ] Codes 
 From the mid-19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. In the course of time these became nomenclature codes . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) governs the naming of animals, [ 31 ] the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) that of plants (including cyanobacteria ), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( ICNB ) that of bacteria (including Archaea ). Virus names are governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.: 
 
 "Binomial nomenclature" is the correct term for botany, [ 32 ] although it is also used by zoologists. [ 33 ] Since 1953, "binomi n al nomenclature" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina). [ 34 ] 
 Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the "genus name". In zoological code ( ICZN ), the second part of the name is a "specific name", or in the botanical code ( ICN ) a "specific epithet". Together, these two parts are referred to as a "species name" or "binomen" in the zoological code; or "species name", "specific name", or a "binary combination" in the botanical code. 
 The ICN , the plant Code , does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym ), whereas the ICZN , the animal Code , does. Thus the American bison has the binomial Bison bison ; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant. 
 The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published Species Plantarum ). In zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's Systema Naturae , 10th Edition, and also Clerck's Aranei Svecici ). Bacteriology started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980. [ 35 ] 
 
 Unifying the different codes into a single code, the " BioCode ", has been suggested, although implementation is not in sight. (There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names clades . This is called the PhyloCode .) 
 [ edit ] Writing binomial names 
 By tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 36 ] Generally the binomial should be printed in a font different from that used in the normal text; for example, " Several more Homo sapiens fossils were discovered ." When handwritten, each part of a binomial name should be underlined; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 37 ] 
 The first part of the binomial, the genus name, is always written with an initial capital letter. In current usage, the second part is never written with an initial capital. [ 38 ]  [ 39 ] Older sources, particularly botanical works published before the 1950s, use a different convention. If the second part of the name is derived from a proper noun, e.g. the name of a person or place, a capital letter was used. Thus the modern form Berberis darwinii was written as Berberis Darwinii . A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g. Panthera Leo or Centaurea Cyanus . [ 40 ]  [ 41 ] 
 When used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication. [ 42 ] For example "The house sparrow ( Passer domesticus ) is decreasing in Europe." 
 The binomial name should generally be written in full. The exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report, or the same species is mentioned repeatedly; in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used, but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop). [ 43 ] For example, a list of members of the genus Canis might be written as " Canis lupus , C. aureus , C. simensis ". In rare cases, this abbreviated form has spread to more general use; for example, the bacterium Escherichia coli is often referred to as just E. coli , and Tyrannosaurus rex is perhaps even better known simply as T. rex , these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given. 
 The abbreviation "sp." is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified. The abbreviation "spp." (plural) indicates "several species". These abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined). [ 44 ] For example: " Canis sp." means "an unspecified species of the genus Canis ", while " Canis spp." means "two or more species of the genus Canis ". (The abbreviations "sp." and "spp." can easily be confused with the abbreviations "ssp." (zoology) or "subsp." (botany), plurals "sspp." or "subspp.", referring to one or more subspecies. See trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name .) 
 The abbreviation " cf. " is used when the identification is not confirmed. [ 45 ] For example " Corvus cf. splendens " indicates "a bird similar to the house crow but not certainly identified as this species". 
 In some contexts the dagger symbol ("†") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct. 
 [ edit ] Authority 
 Main articles: Author citation (zoology) and Author citation (botany) 
 In scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the "authority" – a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany: under the ICZN the surname is written in full together with the date (usually only the year) of publication, whereas under the ICN the name is generally abbreviated and the date omitted. The International Plant Names Index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too. 
 When the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both Codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ICN also requires the person who made the change to be given. Some examples: 
 
 (plant) Amaranthus retroflexus L. – "L." is the standard abbreviation for "Linnaeus"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name. 
 (plant) Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides . 
 (animal) Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) – the original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; unlike the ICN , the ICZN does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.

 Main articles: Biological nomenclature , Trinomial name , and Infraspecific name (botany) 
 Binomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g. family, order, class) receive one part names which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, Passer domesticus , belongs to the family Passeridae . Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany. 
 Ranks below species receive three part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ICZN and the ICN . In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii . In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a "connecting term" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis ; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is Cyclamen hederifolium f. albiflorum .

 Binomial nomenclature (also called binomi n al nomenclature or binary nomenclature ) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms , although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just "binomial"), a binomen or a scientific name ; more informally it is also called a Latin name . The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus Homo and within this genus to the species Homo sapiens . The formal introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus , effectively beginning with his work Species Plantarum in 1753. [ 1 ] 
 The application of binomial nomenclature is now governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of which the two most important are the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) for animals and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) for plants. Although the general principles underlying binomial nomenclature are common to these two codes, there are some differences, both in the terminology they use and in their precise rules. 
 In modern usage, the first letter of the first part of the name, the genus, is always capitalized in writing, while that of the second part is not, even when derived from a proper noun such as the name of a person or place. Similarly, both parts are italicized when a binomial name occurs in normal text. Thus the binomial name of the annual phlox (named after botanist Thomas Drummond ) is now written as Phlox drummondii . 
 In scientific works, the "authority" for a binomial name is usually given, at least when it is first mentioned, and the date of publication may be specified. 
 
 In zoology
 
 " Patella vulgata Linnaeus, 1758". The name "Linnaeus" tells the reader who it was that first published a description and name for this species of sea snail; 1758 is the date of the publication in which the original description can be found (in this case the 10th edition of the book Systema Naturae ). 
 " Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758)". The original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; the ICZN does not require that the name of the person who changed the genus be given, nor the date on which the change was made. 
 
 
 In botany
 
 " Amaranthus retroflexus L." – "L." is the standard abbreviation used in botany for "Linnaeus". 
 " Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named this bluebell species Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides ; the ICN does not require that the dates of either publication be specified.

 [ edit ] History 
 
 
 
  
 Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778), a Swedish botanist, invented the modern system of binomial nomenclature. 
 
 
 See also: Biological classification#Early systems 
 Prior to the adoption of the modern binomial system of naming species, a scientific name consisted of a generic name combined with a specific name that was from one to several words long. Together they formed a system of polynomial nomenclature. [ 2 ] These names had two separate functions. First, to designate or label the species, and second, to be a diagnosis or description; however these two goals were eventually found to be incompatible. [ 3 ] In a simple genus, containing only two species, it was easy to tell them apart with a one-word genus and a one-word specific name; but as more species were discovered the names necessarily became longer and unwieldy, for instance Plantago foliis ovato-lanceolatus pubescentibus, spica cylindrica, scapo tereti (Plantain with pubescent ovate-lanceolate leaves, a cylindric spike and a terete scape), which we know today as Plantago media . 
 Such "polynomial names" may sometimes look like binomials, but are significantly different. For example, Gerard's herbal describes various kinds of spiderwort: "The first is called phalangium ramosum , Branched Spiderwort; the second, phalangium non ramosum , Unbranched Spiderwort. The other ... is aptly termed phalangium ephemerum virginianum , Soone Fading Spiderwort of Virginia". [ 4 ] The Latin phrases are short descriptions, rather than identifying labels. 
 The Bauhins , in particular Caspar Bauhin (1560–1624), took some important steps towards the binomial system, by pruning the Latin descriptions, in many cases to two words. [ 5 ] The adoption by biologists of a system of strictly binomial nomenclature is due to Swedish botanist and physician Carl von Linné, more commonly known by his Latinized name Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778). It was in his 1753 Species Plantarum that he first began consistently using a one-word "trivial name" together with a generic name in a system of binomial nomenclature. [ 6 ] This trivial name is what is now known as a specific epithet ( ICN ) or specific name ( ICZN ). [ 6 ] The Bauhins' genus names were retained in many of these, but the descriptive part was reduced to a single word. 
 Linnaeus's trivial names introduced an important new idea, namely that the function of a name could simply be to give a species a unique label. This meant that the name no longer need be descriptive; for example both parts could be derived from the names of people. Thus Gerard's phalangium ephemerum virginianum became Tradescantia virginiana , where the genus name honoured John Tradescant the younger , [ 7 ] an English botanist and gardener. [ 8 ] A bird in the parrot family was named Psittacus alexandri , meaning "Alexander's parrot", after Alexander the Great whose armies introduced eastern parakeets to Greece. [ 9 ] Linnaeus' trivial names were much easier to remember and use than the parallel polynomial names and eventually replaced them. [ 1 ] 
 [ edit ] Value 
 The value of the binomial nomenclature system derives primarily from its economy, its widespread use, and the uniqueness and stability of names it generally favors: 
 
 Economy. Compared to the polynomial system which it replaced, a binomial name is shorter and easier to remember. [ 1 ] It corresponds to the widespread system of family name plus given name (s) used to name people in many cultures. [ 5 ] 
 Widespread use. The binomial system of nomenclature is governed by international codes and is used by biologists worldwide. [ 10 ] 
 Clarity. Binomial names avoid the confusion that can be created when attempting to use common names to refer to a species. [ 11 ] Common names often differ from one country to another, or even from one part of a country to another. In English-speaking parts of Europe, the bird called a "robin" is Erithacus rubecula . In English-speaking North America, a "robin" is Turdus migratorius . In contrast, the scientific name can be used all over the world, in all languages, avoiding confusion and difficulties of translation. [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] 
 Uniqueness. Provided that taxonomists agree as to the limits of a species, it can have only one name that is correct under the appropriate nomenclature code, generally the earliest published if two or more names are accidentally assigned to a species. [ 13 ] However, establishing that two names actually refer to the same species and then determining which has priority can be difficult, particularly if the species was named by biologists from different countries. Therefore a species may have more than one regularly used name; these names are " synonyms ". [ 14 ] 
 Stability. Although stability is far from absolute, the procedures associated with establishing binomial names tend to favor stability. [ 11 ] For example, when species are transferred between genera (as not uncommonly happens as a result of new knowledge), if possible the second part of the binomial is kept the same. Thus there is disagreement among botanists as to whether the genera Chionodoxa and Scilla are sufficiently different to be kept separate. Those who keep them separate give the plant commonly grown in gardens in Europe the name Chionodoxa siehei ; those who do not give it the name Scilla siehei . [ 15 ] The siehei element is constant. Similarly if what were previously thought to be two distinct species are demoted to a lower rank, such as subspecies, where possible the second part of the binomial name is retained as the third part of the new name. Thus the Tenerife robin may be treated as a different species from the European robin, in which case its name is Erithacus superbus , or as only a subspecies, in which case its name is Erithacus rubecula superbus . [ 16 ] The superbus element of the name is constant. Since taxonomists can legitimately disagree as to whether two genera or two species are distinct or not, more than one name can be in use. [ 17 ] 
 
 [ edit ] Relationship to classification and taxonomy 
 Nomenclature (including binomial nomenclature) is not the same as classification, although the two are related. Classification is the ordering of items into groups based on similarities and/or differences; in biological classification , species are one of the kinds of item to be classified. [ 18 ] In principle, the names given to species could be completely independent of their classification. This is not the case for binomial names, since the first part of a binomial is the name of the genus into which the species is placed. Above the rank of genus, binomial nomenclature and classification are partly independent; for example, a species retains its binomial name if it is moved from one family to another or from one order to another, unless it better fits a different genus in the same or different family, or it is split from its old genus and placed in a newly created genus. The independence is only partial since the names of families and other higher taxa are usually based on genera. [ citation needed ] 
 Taxonomy includes both nomenclature and classification. Its first stages (sometimes called " alpha taxonomy ") are concerned with finding, describing and naming species of living or fossil organisms. [ 19 ] Binomial nomenclature is thus an important part of taxonomy as it is the system by which species are named. Taxonomists are also concerned with classification, including its principles, procedures and rules. [ 20 ] 
 [ edit ] Derivation of binomial names 
 See also: List of Latin and Greek words commonly used in systematic names 
 A complete binomial name is always treated grammatically as if it were a phrase in the Latin language (hence the common use of the term "Latin name" for a binomial name). However, the two parts of a binomial name can each be derived from a number of sources, of which Latin is only one. These include: 
 
 Latin, either classical or medieval . Thus both parts of the binomial name Homo sapiens are Latin words, meaning "wise" ( sapiens ) "human/man" ( Homo ). 
 Classical Greek . The genus Rhododendron was named by Linnaeus from the Greek word ῥοδόδενδρον , itself derived from rhodos , rose, and dendron , tree. [ 21 ] Greek words are often converted to a Latinized form. Thus coca (the plant from which cocaine is obtained) has the name Erythroxylum coca . Erythroxylum is derived from the Greek words erythros , red, and xylon , wood. [ 22 ] The Greek neuter ending - ον (-on) is often converted to the Latin neuter ending -um. [ a ] 
 
 
 Other languages. The second part of the name Erythroxylum coca is derived from the name of the plant in the Quechua language. [ 23 ] Since many dinosaur fossils were found in Mongolia, their names often use Mongolian words, e.g. Tarchia from tarkhi , meaning "brain", or Saichania meaning "beautiful one". 
 Names of people (often naturalists or biologists). The name Magnolia campbellii commemorates two people: Pierre Magnol , a French botanist, and Archibald Campbell , a doctor in British India . [ 24 ] 
 Names of places. The lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum is widespread in the United States. [ 25 ] 
 Other sources. Some binominal names have been constructed from anagrams or other re-orderings of existing names. Thus the name of the genus Muilla is derived by reversing the name Allium . [ 26 ] Names may also be derived from jokes or puns. For example, Ratcliffe described a number of species of Rhinoceros beetle , including Cyclocephala nodanotherwon . [ 27 ] 
 
 The first part of the name, which identifies the genus, must be a word which can be treated as a Latin singular noun in the nominative case . It must be unique within each kingdom , but can be repeated between kingdoms. Thus Huia recurvata is an extinct species of plant, found as fossils in Yunnan , China, [ 28 ] whereas Huia masonii is a species of frog found in Java , Indonesia. [ 29 ] 
 The second part of the name, which identifies the species within the genus, is also treated grammatically as a Latin word. It can have one of a number of forms. 
 
 The second part of a binomial may be an adjective. The adjective must agree with the genus name in gender . Latin has three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, shown by varying endings to nouns and adjectives. The house sparrow has the binomial name Passer domesticus . Here domesticus ("domestic") simply means "associated with the house". The sacred bamboo is Nandina domestic a  [ 30 ] rather than Nandina domestic us , since Nandina is feminine whereas Passer is masculine. The tropical fruit langsat is a product of the plant Lansium domestic um , since Lansium is neuter. Some common endings for Latin adjectives in the three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter) are -us , -a , -um (as in the previous example of domesticus ); -is , -is , -e (e.g. tristis , meaning "sad"); and -or , -or , -us (e.g. minor , meaning "smaller"). For further information, see Latin declension: Adjectives . 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the nominative case. An example is the binomial name of the lion, which is Panthera leo . Grammatically the noun is said to be in apposition to the genus name and the two nouns do not have to agree in gender; in this case, Panthera is feminine and leo is masculine. 
 The second part of a binomial may be a noun in the genitive (possessive) case. The genitive case is constructed in a number of ways in Latin, depending on the declension of the noun. Common endings for masculine and neuter nouns are -ii or -i in the singular and -orum in the plural, and for feminine nouns -ae in the singular and -arum in the plural. The noun may be part of a person's name, often the surname, as in the Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii , the shrub Magnolia hodgsonii , or the Olive-backed Pipit Anthus hodgsoni . The meaning is "of the person named", so that Magnolia hodgsonii means "Hodgson's magnolia". The -ii or -i endings show that in each case Hodgson was a man (not the same one); had Hodgson been a woman, hodgsonae would have been used. The person commemorated in the binomial name is not usually (if ever) the person who created the name; for example Anthus hodgsoni was named by Charles Wallace Richmond , in honour of Hodgson. Rather than a person, the noun may be related to a place, as with Latimeria chalumnae , meaning "of the Chalumna River ". Another use of genitive nouns is in, for example, the name of the bacterium Escherichia coli , where coli means "of the colon ". This formation is common in parasites, as in Xenos vesparum , where vesparum means "of the wasps", since Xenos vesparum is a parasite of wasps. 
 
 Whereas the first part of a binomial name must be unique within a kingdom, the second part is quite commonly used in two or more genera (as is shown by examples of hodgsonii above). The full binomial name must be unique within a kingdom. 
 [ edit ] Codes 
 From the mid-19th century onwards it became ever more apparent that a body of rules was necessary to govern scientific names. In the course of time these became nomenclature codes . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) governs the naming of animals, [ 31 ] the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants ( ICN ) that of plants (including cyanobacteria ), and the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria ( ICNB ) that of bacteria (including Archaea ). Virus names are governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ), a taxonomic code, which determines taxa as well as names. These codes differ in certain ways, e.g.: 
 
 "Binomial nomenclature" is the correct term for botany, [ 32 ] although it is also used by zoologists. [ 33 ] Since 1953, "binomi n al nomenclature" is the technically correct term in zoology. A binominal name is also called a binomen (plural binomina). [ 34 ] 
 Both codes consider the first part of the two-part name for a species to be the "genus name". In zoological code ( ICZN ), the second part of the name is a "specific name", or in the botanical code ( ICN ) a "specific epithet". Together, these two parts are referred to as a "species name" or "binomen" in the zoological code; or "species name", "specific name", or a "binary combination" in the botanical code. 
 The ICN , the plant Code , does not allow the two parts of a binomial name to be the same (such a name is called a tautonym ), whereas the ICZN , the animal Code , does. Thus the American bison has the binomial Bison bison ; a name of this kind would not be allowed for a plant. 
 The starting points, the time from which these codes are in effect (retroactively), vary from group to group. In botany the starting point will often be in 1753 (the year Carl Linnaeus first published Species Plantarum ). In zoology the starting point is 1758 (1 January 1758 is considered the date of the publication of Linnaeus's Systema Naturae , 10th Edition, and also Clerck's Aranei Svecici ). Bacteriology started anew, with a starting point on 1 January 1980. [ 35 ] 
 
 Unifying the different codes into a single code, the " BioCode ", has been suggested, although implementation is not in sight. (There is also a code in development for a different system of classification which does not use ranks, but instead names clades . This is called the PhyloCode .) 
 [ edit ] Writing binomial names 
 By tradition, the binomial names of species are usually typeset in italics; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 36 ] Generally the binomial should be printed in a font different from that used in the normal text; for example, " Several more Homo sapiens fossils were discovered ." When handwritten, each part of a binomial name should be underlined; for example, Homo sapiens . [ 37 ] 
 The first part of the binomial, the genus name, is always written with an initial capital letter. In current usage, the second part is never written with an initial capital. [ 38 ]  [ 39 ] Older sources, particularly botanical works published before the 1950s, use a different convention. If the second part of the name is derived from a proper noun, e.g. the name of a person or place, a capital letter was used. Thus the modern form Berberis darwinii was written as Berberis Darwinii . A capital was also used when the name is formed by two nouns in apposition, e.g. Panthera Leo or Centaurea Cyanus . [ 40 ]  [ 41 ] 
 When used with a common name, the scientific name often follows in parentheses, although this varies with publication. [ 42 ] For example "The house sparrow ( Passer domesticus ) is decreasing in Europe." 
 The binomial name should generally be written in full. The exception to this is when several species from the same genus are being listed or discussed in the same paper or report, or the same species is mentioned repeatedly; in which case the genus is written in full when it is first used, but may then be abbreviated to an initial (and a period/full stop). [ 43 ] For example, a list of members of the genus Canis might be written as " Canis lupus , C. aureus , C. simensis ". In rare cases, this abbreviated form has spread to more general use; for example, the bacterium Escherichia coli is often referred to as just E. coli , and Tyrannosaurus rex is perhaps even better known simply as T. rex , these two both often appearing in this form in popular writing even where the full genus name has not already been given. 
 The abbreviation "sp." is used when the actual specific name cannot or need not be specified. The abbreviation "spp." (plural) indicates "several species". These abbreviations are not italicised (or underlined). [ 44 ] For example: " Canis sp." means "an unspecified species of the genus Canis ", while " Canis spp." means "two or more species of the genus Canis ". (The abbreviations "sp." and "spp." can easily be confused with the abbreviations "ssp." (zoology) or "subsp." (botany), plurals "sspp." or "subspp.", referring to one or more subspecies. See trinomen (zoology) and infraspecific name .) 
 The abbreviation " cf. " is used when the identification is not confirmed. [ 45 ] For example " Corvus cf. splendens " indicates "a bird similar to the house crow but not certainly identified as this species". 
 In some contexts the dagger symbol ("†") may be used before or after the binomial name to indicate that the species is extinct. 
 [ edit ] Authority 
 Main articles: Author citation (zoology) and Author citation (botany) 
 In scholarly texts, at least the first or main use of the binomial name is usually followed by the "authority" – a way of designating the scientist(s) who first published the name. The authority is written in slightly different ways in zoology and botany: under the ICZN the surname is written in full together with the date (usually only the year) of publication, whereas under the ICN the name is generally abbreviated and the date omitted. The International Plant Names Index maintains an approved list of botanical author abbreviations. Historically, abbreviations were used in zoology too. 
 When the original name is changed, e.g. the species is moved to a different genus, both Codes use parentheses around the original authority; the ICN also requires the person who made the change to be given. Some examples: 
 
 (plant) Amaranthus retroflexus L. – "L." is the standard abbreviation for "Linnaeus"; the absence of parentheses shows that this is his original name. 
 (plant) Hyacinthoides italica (L.) Rothm. – Linnaeus first named the Italian bluebell Scilla italica ; Rothmaler transferred it to the genus Hyacinthoides . 
 (animal) Passer domesticus (Linnaeus, 1758) – the original name given by Linnaeus was Fringilla domestica ; unlike the ICN , the ICZN does not require the name of the person who changed the genus to be given.

 Main articles: Biological nomenclature , Trinomial name , and Infraspecific name (botany) 
 Binomial nomenclature, as described here, is a system for naming species. Implicitly it includes a system for naming genera, since the first part of the name of the species is a genus name. In a classification system based on ranks there are also ways of naming ranks above the level of genus and below the level of species. Ranks above genus (e.g. family, order, class) receive one part names which are conventionally not written in italics. Thus the house sparrow, Passer domesticus , belongs to the family Passeridae . Family names are normally based on genus names, although the endings used differ between zoology and botany. 
 Ranks below species receive three part names, conventionally written in italics like the names of species. There are significant differences between the ICZN and the ICN . In zoology, the only rank below species is subspecies and the name is written simply as three parts (a trinomen). Thus one of the subspecies of the olive-backed pipit is Anthus hodgsoni berezowskii . In botany, there are many ranks below species and although the name itself is written in three parts, a "connecting term" (not part of the name) is needed to show the rank. Thus the American black elder is Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis ; the white-flowered form of the ivy-leaved cyclamen is Cyclamen hederifolium f. albiflorum .

Nomenclature, Classification       BiologicalNomenclature  Nomenclature: nomen (name) and calare (to call) -- to call by name.  Important internet sites regardingnomenclature:        International Commission   on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN)                 International Code   of Zoological Nomenclature                 Bulletin of   Zoological Nomenclature                 Official Lists   and Indexes of Names and Works in Zoology                 Towards   Stability in the Names of Animals                 American   Association for Zoological Nomenclature (AAZN)                 European   Association for Zoological Nomenclature (EAZN)              One of the primary responsibilities of systematic biology is thedevelopment of our biological nomenclature and classifications.Nomenclature is not an end to systematics and taxonomy but is anecessity in organizing information about biodiversity. Nomenclaturefunctions to provide labels (names) for all taxa at all levels in thehierarchy of life.                Biological nomenclature is, to some   degree, the parlance of systematic biology. It derives from   the binomial (or binominal) nomenclature that was originally   codified in the works of Linnaeus, Species Plantarum    (1753) and Systema Naturae, 10th Edition (1758).   These publications are the decided starting points for the   modern biological nomenclature in most groups of plants and   animals.      Together with the presentation of the consistent binomial system ofnaming, Linnaeus also developed a system of organizing the diversityof life in a hierarchical classification. Latin was the importantlanguage of the time of Linnaeus and continues to be a criticallanguage for international communication. As will be seen below thevarious Codes for nomenclature consider Latin to be an essentiallanguage.    Taxa at the level of species are named with binomials, consisting of generic and specific epithets or names that together equal the species name    Taxa above the level of species are Supraspecific Taxa and are Uninominals.    Taxa below the level of species are Subspecies are are Trinominals.   The binomial system has been a successful systembecause it is functional, has been the only system that has beenuniversally accepted, and has been used over the last 250 ofnomenclature. Recent literature, however, has examined somealternative methods; these will not be covered herein.  Biological nomenclature is a language that we useto communicate ideas and information about the diversity of life. Itis an information retrieval system conveying information aboutdiversity and relationships.  Common vs ScientificNames  Common names for species are words in thelanguage of the layperson. These names can often bemisleading.  Disadvantages:  They are not useful to people with a different language or dialect    Some species have several common names    Some species share the same common name    Some species may not have a common name  Scientific names are Latin or Latinizednames that are standardized by a series of rules and are applicableworldwide.    Linnaean Hierarchy!  This is a system of categories that connotetaxonomic rank. The same thing could be achieved through a system ofindentation (see below) or a system of numbers connoting rank in ahierarchy. However, these latter systems are generally more difficultto represent and remember by the user.  With the Linnaean system one only needs to knowthe general categories and know rank order in thehierarchy!  The original Linnaean system had a limited set ofcategories that successfully reflected a nested set of groups withingroups.        Linnaean Hierarchy in 10th   Edition of Systema Naturae (1758)                 Later many authors began to incorporate categoriesabove and below these original categories. Some classificationscontain well in excess of 10 different categories, as can be seebelow.        Categories Used in More Modern   Classifications                   Proper Usage of Taxonomic Categories         Taxonomic Category                       Singular               Plural                         Kingdom                     Kingdom              Kingdoms                        Phylum                     Phylum              Phyla                        Class                     Class              Classes                        Order                     Order              Orders                        Family                     Family              Families                        Genus                     Genus              Genera                        Species                     Species              Species                         Important Dates in the History ofNomenclatorial Codes        1758        Linnaeus' 10th Edition of Systema Naturae          1840        Strickland Code of British Association for the   Advancement of Science          1867        Set of "laws" at Paris International Botanical   Congress          1881        French Code developed          1887        U.

Workers of his time and subsequent to the development ofhis hierarchy either used his system and are recognized today or didnot and there works are now largely rejected andforgotten.  There are four different codes of nomenclaturetoday. We will deal primarily with the International Code forZoological Nomenclature (ICZN).  International Code of ZoologicalNomenclature. 1999. Fourth Edition. International Trust forZoological Nomenclature. London. 306 pp.  InternationalCode of Botanical Nomenclature.  1994.Koeltz Scientific Publishers, Koenigstein, Germany ( I nternationalAssociation for Plant Taxonomy )  International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria. 1976. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C. 180pp.  International Code of Nomenclature forCultivated Plants. 1980. American Horticultural Society. 32pp.  In Zoology the code consists of a series of"Articles" and "Recommendations."  Articles &endash; intended to be followed strictly by those involved in the creation or modifications of scientific names or supraspecific taxon names.    Recommendations &endash; intended as guidelines that should be followed if working on creation or modifications of scientific names or supraspecific taxon names.    Some General Objectives of ScientificNomenclature and Codes  Uniqueness . The name of a particularorganism gives one immediate access to all of the known informationabout the particular taxon. Every name must be unique because it isthe key to the entire literature relating to the species or highertaxon in question. If several names have been given to the sametaxon, there must be a clear-cut method whereby it can be determinedwhich of the names has validity  Universality . Scientific communicationwouldbe made very difficult if we had only vernacular names for taxa ininnumerable languages in order to communicate with each other. Toavoid this we have adopted an international agreement for a singlelanguage (Latin) and a single set of names for biological diversityto be used on a worldwide basis.  Stability . As recognition symbols ofdiversity, names of organisms would lose much of their usefulness ifthey were changed frequently and arbitrarily.    Groups of Names Covered by Codes  The names covered by the various codes fall intothe following groups. A name proposed in a given grouping can serveat any level within that grouping.  Superfamilial names  These are names above the family-group level. These names are not regulated in zoology and need not be based on generic names. These names generally do not have standardized endings.    In the botanical literature it is recommended that these namesbe based on a nomenclatorial type (generic name; to be covered below) and have standardized endings.  Family-Group names  Includes groups from genus-group names up to and including the rank of Superfamily. The most commonly used ranks are tribe, subfamily, family, and superfamily; however, the latter is not used in botany.    Names in this group usually have standardized endings for botany and zoology. Some of the names established by Linnaeus have been considered exceptions to the standardized endings in botany.    Names in this group are based on generic names and types.  Genus-Group names  Applies to generic and subgeneric names. (The same rules apply at all levels)  Species-Group names  Applies to species and subspecies names in zoology and infraspecific names in botany. (The same rules apply at all levels)          Species Names  In the hierarchical system developed by Linnaeusspecies are referred to by two different "names". Historically,predecessors of Linnaeus referred to species in descriptive phrases,in Latin.    Binominal consists of a genus and species name(epithet).    Each species is placed into a genus .     Generic names are Latin nouns.     Names of species are Latin adjectives in  agreement with the nouns (Generic epithet) (or are nouns in  apposition).      Generic names (epithets) always begin with a capital letter; species names (epithets) always begin with lower-case letter.      Homo sapiens      Both names are set apart from the accompaning text :     The species is Homo sapiens.   The species is Homo sapiens.   The species is Homo sapiens      Scientific names do not include diacritial marks but may be hyphenated      Erimystax x-punctata      Author's names    All generic and specific epithets have authors, the name(s) of the person(s) who first officially described them in a publication. You will often see scientific names with an author's name following it. This is often confusing to non-taxonomists but is really important because it is very useful in tracing the history of applications of names through time. Scientific names with very similar spellings can usually be distinguished from one another when an author's names is included.      Rhinacloa pallipes Reuter   Rhinacloa pallidipes Maldonado      Dates of authorship    Dates of official descriptions can also be included with scientific names to further clarify situations and locate relevant literature.      Macrocoleus femoralis Reuter,  1879   Cyrtocapsus femoralis Reuter, 1892   Psallopsis femoralis Reuter, 1901      Author's names in parentheses - typographical errors?    No. If the species in question in a particular classification is in the genus in which it was described the author's name(s) do not appear in parentheses      Notropis cardinalis   Mayden     However, if the species in a classification is in a genus other than the one in which it was described the author's name(s) appear in parentheses      Luxilus cardinalis   (Mayden)     In the botanical literature the same applies but the author's name(s) in parentheses may be followed by another name of the author who moved the species to its genus of current placement.      Ceratozamia boliviana Brongn.   Zamia boliviana (Brongn.) A. DC.      Different usages of the same name?    In some instances in zoology authors may use a scientific name differently than the person (author) who originally described the species. In such a case the scientific name, as listed in catalogs and other writings, is separated from users name by a colon.   Phytocoris marmoratus Blanchard  Phytocoris marmoratus : Stonedahl.     Basic Tenets of theCodes  While the codes differ in their organization andsome rules the basic ideas behind all of the codes are outlinedbelow. Each of these will be discussed in more detailbelow.    Priority    Availability    Typification     Species-group names     Genus-group names      Homonymy    Synonymy      Priority  This is a simple concept: the first name appliedto a taxon is the name that will be used.  Often, taxonomists, systematists, ecologists,behavioral biologists, and others encounter multiple names thatappear to relate to the same taxon, say a species. Which name iscorrect?  While not part of his system, Linnaeus did endorsepriority in principle but did not practice it.  Such a dilema typically is the result of earlytaxonomic studies where researchers were in different parts of theworld or continent and were independently describing taxa withoutknowledge that another person was describing the sametaxon.  It can also result from researchers not fullyunderstanding variation within a species or that the different"looking" things are different stages in a life cycle or differentsexes.  Example: parrot fishes, aphids  Priority relates to date of publication or mailingdate (public availability). Priority involves only date, not page orline precedence. If the day is not determinable then the accepteddate is the lst day of the smallest time unit (week, month, year)that can be determined. Older valid names have priority over newervalid names; the oldest valid name of a taxon takes precendence overall other names of a taxon. Generally this name is referred to as thesenior name.  In zoology priority extends to ranks of theSuperfamily and below.  Priority is not indended to upset stabilitybecause stability of classification is one of the basic objectives ofbiological classification. Thus, in instances where a name changewould cause much confusion the codes provide provisions that permitthe conservation of a younger and well-established name. In zoologythe ICZN has the power to suppress an older name and make the youngername the valid name for the taxon.  Priority extends back to particular taxonomicworks for each group of organisms. Names applied before thesespecified works are not considered valid names.  The baseline priority for zoological nomenclature begins with Linnaeus' Systema Naturae , 10th edition, considered published 1 January 1758. Any works published in 1758 or after are considered published.    For spiders the baseline priority dates to the work of Clerck (1757).    Baseline priority for botanical names dates to Linnaeus' Species Plantarum (1753)    Simple example of priority:  Stoneroller  Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque)  Rutilus anomalus Rafinesque, 1820.    Exoglossum spinicephalum Valenciennes, 1844    Exoglossum dubium Kirtland, 1845    Leuciscus prolixus Storer, 1845    Chondrostoma pullum Agassiz, 1854    Campostoma nasutum Girard, 1856    Campostoma formosulum Girard, 1856    Dionda plumbea Girard, 1856  These are all valid and available names for thesame taxon (species). Using priority the correct name to be appliedto the taxon is Rutilus anomalus Rafinesque but when placed inthe genus Campostoma the specific epithet must agree in genderwith the genus. Hence, the name becomes Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque).    More complex example ofpriority:  Lygaeus salititans Fallen,1807  Chlamydatus was described by Curtis (1883)and included a new species marginatus Curtis.  Fieber (1858) described new genus Agalliastes that included saltitans (Fallen), alongwith other species.  The type of Agalliastes was fixed as saltitans by Kirkaldy in 1906.  Flor synonymized marginatus Curtis with salititans Fallen.  Thus, Chlamydatus salititans (Fallen) is the name that must be used on the basis ofpriority    Finally, there is a basic conflict between theobjective of stability and the code of priority.     Availability  Whereas priority is a comparatively objectivecriterion, availability is more nebulous. With reference to thedifferent codes most names would be considered "available" if theymeet the following four criteria.    Appear in a work published after 1753 for plants and 1758 for most animals.    Meet the criteria for publication designated by the codes.    Are written in the Latin alphabet (today in English except for plants)    Are binominal (if referring to species)   The codes also require other things depending uponthe code.  Publication:  Okay publications -    Must be issued publically for the purpose of providing a permanent scientific record.    Must be obtainable, when first issued, free of charge or by purchase.    Must have been produced in an edition containing simultaneously obtainable copies by a method that assures numerous identical copies.     Before 1986, must be via ink on paper, i.e.  conventional printing or mimeographing (latter okay in zoology  but not botany)     After 1985 can be via photocopying or any  other "unconventional" method but must include a statement that  nomenclatural content is for permanent, public, adn scientific  record therein.     Forbidden publications -    Distribution on microfilm, computer printouts, or pre-1986 photocopies    A mention of a name at a scientific meeting    Labeling specimens deposited in a museum    The distribution of proof sheets (zoology)    Deposition of document (e.g., thesis) in a collection of documents, a library, or other archive    Distribution only to colleagues or students of a note, even if printed, in explanation of an accompanying illustration.   Criteria for "publication" are being evaluatedseriously now with the many more options for reproducting multiplecopies available to the public for permanent record (dissertationsthrough University Microfilms and WWW).       Typification  The ideas of priority and availability wereimplicit in studies from the time of Linnaeus. However, the typeconcept was not.  Early authors considered the most common speciesto be "typical" of the genus. Species were represented by a series of"typical" specimens. Linnaeus commonly replaced is typical specimenswith "better" specimens. This is a big problem for manyreasons.  This was problematic. It became difficult forfixing generic limits or determining representatives of differentspecies names.  The type concept and requirement for designationof types partially solved this problem and assisted in the objectiveof stability; it was a major advance in the evolution of the codes.In zoology it was codified in the Regles (the firstcode: International Nomenclature of Zoology adopted by 5th Congress,published under the 6th Congress in 1905). Mandatory designation oftypes in botany did not apply until Jan. 1958.  This procedure ties names to specimens and isimportant.  The concept is not typological:    The type specimen is not meant to be  "typical"     Types are not suppose to represent variation  in a taxon.     However, there are some biases practiced  today.     A "good" specimen       An adult in breeding condition or with   additional characters visible.    Types of Types:    There are two forms of types - (1) names or (2) specimens.       Species-group types.     These represent a single specimen to  which a name is attached. This provides an objective criterion  for establishment of usage of that name. Species-group types  are recognized in the codes as primary types and include the  following possibilities.      Type locality: All types of species  and subspecies are tied to a spatial location called the  type locality.      Holotype : Single specimen designated  by the author(s) of the name at the time of publication of the  original description.      Neotype: A specimen later designated  to replace a holotype (or other primary type) if the latter can  be documented as lost or destroyed.      Syntypes : A group of specimens  thought to represent a species, as designated or indicated byt  he author(s) of the original description. These specimens may  sometimes be referred to as the "type series". Cotypes are  sometimes used in the same way. If syntypes exist for a species  only from this series can a lectotype be designated. &#91;Many  early descriptions of species were based on syntypes because  the requirement for a holotype designation or indication did  not exist&#93;.      Lectotype : One of the syntypes chosen  by the original or subsequent author(s) to function as the name  bearer.      Primary types are customarily  deposited in recognized institutions dedicated to the long-term  maintenance of collections.      Other types:      Isotype : a specimen (in botany)  collected from the same individual plant as the  holotype.      Topotypes : specimen(s) collected from  the same location as the holotype (perhaps at the same  time).      Paratype : Commonly designated in  descriptions of new species as specimens being studied by the  author in the description of the new species or subspecies and  designated by that person at the time of publication of the  original description. These specimens are valuable as reference  materials that are deposited at multiple, dedicated museums or  institutions, they have no standing in nomenclature (these  series can sometimes contain misidentified specimens).  Paratypes may, however, serve as useful materials to select a  neotype from if needed.    Genus-group types.    These types represent species, comprised of names - not specimens. Traditionally authors did not designate types of genera; modern codes, however, require that for a generic or subgeneric name to become available a type species must be designated by the author describing the new genus or subgenus.    Types for genera published before mandates of types are most commonly fixed &endash; assigned either through monotypy or subsequent designation.    Monotypy : The genus has only  one species included in it at the time that they type species  is designated and is thus monotypic. If other species are added  to the genus before a type is designated then the type can only  be the original species that existed in the genus.      Subsequent designation : If more than  one species was originally included in a new genus the type can  be selected either by the original author or at a later time by  another person.      Indication : An original indication of  a type is one that the author of the name indicates via  illustration or other means and is referred to as typus or  typicus.      Tautonymy : When a new genus and  species is described with the same name for the genus and  species epithet it becomes the type. An example is Bison bison.  This is okay in zoology but not in botany.    Family-group names.    Genera form the types in these groups. Family group names are subject to the rules of homonymy (below), in that no two can be spelled identically, even though they may be based on different, although similar, generic names. Just because a generic name on which the oldest family-group name is based is in synonymy (below), this does not invalidate the family group name.    For example:    Insect suborder Heteroptera the family  Velocipedidae contains a single valid genus Scotomedes .  The generic name on which the family name is based,  Velocipedes , is a junior synonym of  Scotomedes .     Angiosperm genus Winteria is a junior  synonym of Drimys but the genus is in the family  Winteraceae.     Homonymy  This basic principle refers to the application ofthe same name to different taxa. Our codes of nomenclature state thatNO two names above the species-group level may be the same in zoologyor botany, although names may be duplicated between the twofields.  Homonyms are of different types:  Senior homonyms : The available name on the basis of priority.    Junior homonyms : A preoccupied name (not in use) on the basis of priority or by a ruling by a nomenclatorial body.    Primary homonyms : In a species-group (species, subspecies, etc.) these are names that are the same and were proposed in the same genus-group taxon. The junior homonym must always be replaced must always be replaced either by a new name or a junior synonym (if one exists)    Example: Cottus pygmaeus   &endash; pygmy sculpin. This species was described and later it  was discovered that this name was already preoccupied by an old  description of a Cottus from the Old World. This then is  a primary homonym. A new name for the pygmy sculpin is  currently being described.    Secondary Homonyms : These are species that are placed in the same genus subsequent to their publication and they have the same specific epithets. The senior secondary homonym is the older of the two names. An alternative name will have to be provided either through description or junior synonyms for the junior homonym.    Example:  Cyprinella garmani (Jordan)  gibbous shiner  Notropis garmani Jordan, 1885:813. &#91;Substitute name for preoccupied rubripinna Garman, 1881&#93;    Cyprinella rubripinna Garman, 1881:91. &#91;Original description; Type locality: Lago del Muerto, near Parras, Coahuila, Mexico.&#93;      Synonymy  In taxonomy the concept of synonymy relates to theapplication of different names to the same taxon. As in the case forhomonyms, synonyms can be of several types.  Senior synonyms: The oldest of two or morenames that are considered valid by nomenclatorial codes. This isusually based on priority, but may also be done on the basis ofchoice of names by the first revisor (zoology) or by a nomenclatorialgoverning body.  Junioir synonyms: The junior names arethoase that are considered invalid on the basis of priority orbecause of a choice of the first revisor, or by a governing body ofnomenclature. These names, however, can be elevated to seniorsynonyms if new taxa are identified later and the type(s) of the newtaxa are the name bearers of these names.  Objective synonyms: Different names that byexamination of nomenclatorial literature alone are judged to refer tothe same taxon. For example, any two family-group names with the sametype genus or any two genera with the same type species are objectivesynonyms. Two species based on the same specimen are also consideredobjective synonyms. These synonyms are generally created only by adrug or alcohol-induced stupor that lasts for days or weeks for theauthor or by an inadvertent error.  Subjective synonyms: These are differentnames that have been applied taxon as determined by a taxonomist orsystematist. An example would include two species originallydescribed as distinct but were later determined by a professionial inthe field that they are the same species. This is the most commontype of synonymy and these can be the sources of confusion and greatdebate.  Example:  Stoneroller  Campostoma anomalum (Rafinesque)  Rutilus anomalus Rafinesque, 1820.    Exoglossum spinicephalum Valenciennes, 1844    Exoglossum dubium Kirtland, 1845    Leuciscus prolixus Storer, 1845    Chondrostoma pullum Agassiz, 1854    Campostoma nasutum Girard, 1856    Campostoma formosulum Girard, 1856    Dionda plumbea Girard, 1856    Regarding Stability ofNomenclature  The strict application of the code can be suspended in some instances.    One has the right to appeal to the commission.    There is a statute of limitation for an unused senior synonym in zoology of 50 year = nomen oblitum    Other items on Nomenclature  First revisor principle:  This is the first person to examine a species or group of species under the modern codes. This person has the right to choose which of several equally valid names is to be used. They may also identify a lectotype and designate and restrict type localities. They may choose senior synonyms among names published in the same publication by page or line priority if they wish.  Retroactive? Yes.  Validity and Availability  Name correctly formed and validly and effectively published    Available (zoology)     Legitimate (botany)    However, the only name that can be used is a valid (zoology) or correct (botany) name.  Illegitimate names  Forgotten name = nomen oblitum  (after 1960 if not used for 50 years) &#91; Law of proscription&#93;    Superfluous name = nomen superfluum    A name is superfluous if it includes  the type of another name wich should have been used (i.e., a  description error; should never have been described)    Ambiguous name = nomen ambiguum    A name that has been used for a long  time in different contexts and is thus confused  (seriously)    Dubious name = nomen dubium    Available name but cannot be assigned  to a definite taxon due to the shortcomings in the original  description/diagnosis or because of type material problems.  These names are in taxonomic limbo and are never allocated  until such time that a type fixation is devised. Usually in  these cases no type was designated or only an illustration may  exist.    Improper publication of a new name without a description    = nomen nudum . These are names  that may be nomenclaturally published but lack any description  or indication; they have no nomenclatural status (i.e., not  occupied)     Supressed names = nomina conservanda.      These are names that have been suppressed by a nomenclatural governing body.  Law of type fixation  Provides for the fixation of a name application, at all levels, by designation of a single type.  What constitutes an indication?    A bibliographic reference to a previously published description, definition, or figure.    Inclusion of a name in an index to a work    Substitution of new name for a previously established name    Citation of one or more available epithets in combination with, or listed under, the new generic name    Illustration of an included species    Description of the "work" on an animal (tubes, tracks, feces, nests, galls, etc.)   Differential diagnosis  Minimum description is necessary    One should go beyond and compare to nearest relatives  Names of hybrids  No! They are not taxa, they are individual organisms. However, there are species of hybrid origin and these are taxa and should be named.  Date of publication  This is the mailing date, not the printed date.  Formation of names  Latin or latinized    Gender must agree    Use no long, hard to pronounce names (recommendation)    Do not use the same name as a species in a related genus (or subspecies in a related species) because it could become a homonym.    The taxonomist should provide etymology (and gender)  Patronyms  Women = -ae; Man = -i; Brothers or Mr and Mrs -orum; Sisters -arum    However, it is preferred by many that the names be descriptive.  Original Spelling  The original spelling is retained with exceptions ( lapsus calami = inadvertant printer's error)  Authorship  No anonymous descriptions after 1950  Use of parentheses  Abbreviations for authors (L. = Linnaeus)  Suspension  Any automatic provision of the code which disturbs the objectives of nomenclature can be suspended for any given case presented by appeal to the ICZN for use of its plenary powers.  Occupation:  For a name to have status in nomenclature it mustbe occupied. This requires the following.  Properly published    Must be in Latin or Latinized    Must be formed properly    Cannot be based on hypothetical taxa, teratological specimens, hybrids, etc.    Must be accompanied by a description, diagnosis, and indication    (After 1930 must have an actual  diagnosis or definition or reference to OR be proposed  expressly as a replacement name for an existing name)    In addition:    After 1930 &endash; genus group names  the type species must be unambiguously designated. Species  group names - a description of the work alone is  unacceptable.     After 1950 &endash; name cannot be proposed  anonymously  If any of these are violated the name isnonexistent nomenclatorially.  However, species group names can be based on anystage of the life cycle or life history, either sex, or bodypart.  Availability  Again, those names that are occupied,identifiable, and, in addition, would be valid of they were theearliest available name of the taxon (excludes some homonyms, nominaoblita, nomina dubia, names suppressed by the nomenclatorialgoverning body. A name may be occupied but not available.  Generic names  Treated as Latin nouns    Latin nouns have grammatical gender, but this usually has nothing to do with the actual gender; often indicated by ending    &endash; a mostly are  feminine     &endash; us mostly are  masculine     &endash; is may be either masculine  or feminine     &endash; um mostly are  neuter     &endash; e feminine or  neuter

The cells of eukaryotes (left) and prokaryotes (right) 
 
 
 The cell is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known living organisms . It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing (except virus , which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ), and is often called the building block of life. 
 It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . [ 1 ] Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including most bacteria ) or multicellular (including plants and animals ). 
 While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, Humans contain about 100 trillion (10 14 ) cells. [ 2 ] Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100&#160; micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope. [ 3 ] 
 The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that all cells come from preexisting cells, that vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. [ 4 ] Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. 
 The word cell comes from the Latin cella , meaning "small room". [ 5 ] The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in.

Diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell 
 
 
 The prokaryote cell is simpler, and therefore smaller, than a eukaryote cell, lacking a nucleus and most of the other organelles of eukaryotes. There are two kinds of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea ; these share a similar structure. 
 The nuclear material of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm . Here, the undefined nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid . 
 A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions: 
 
 On the outside, flagella and pili project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells. 
 Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope – generally consisting of a cell wall covering a plasma membrane though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a capsule . The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. Though most prokaryotes have a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea). The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and finally bursting ( cytolysis ) from osmotic pressure against a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryote cells ( plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall. 
 Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the cell genome (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. A prokaryotic chromosome is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi , which causes Lyme disease). [ 8 ] Though not forming a nucleus , the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid . Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids , which are usually circular. Plasmids enable additional functions, such as antibiotic resistance . 
 
 Eukaryotic cells 
 Main article: Eukaryote 
 Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic . These cells are about 15 times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus , a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true nucleus." Other differences include: 
 
 The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present. 
 The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes , which are associated with histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the cell nucleus , separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria also contain some DNA. 
 Many eukaryotic cells are ciliated with primary cilia . Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, mechanosensation , and thermosensation. Cilia may thus be "viewed as sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation." [ 9 ] 
 Eukaryotes can move using motile cilia or flagella . The flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.

 Subcellular components 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic , have a membrane that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells (except red blood cells which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin ) possess DNA , the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function. 
 Membrane 
 Main article: Cell membrane 
 The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a cell membrane or plasma membrane . The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a cell wall . This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of lipids ( hydrophobic fat-like molecules) and hydrophilic phosphorus molecules. Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer , or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ( molecule or ion ) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones . 
 Cytoskeleton 
 Main article: Cytoskeleton 
 
 
 
  
Bovine Pulmonary Artery Endothelial cell: nuclei stained blue, mitochondria stained red, and F-actin , an important component in microfilaments, stained green. Cell imaged on a fluorescent microscope. 
 
 
 The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis , the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis , the separation of daughter cells after cell division ; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments , intermediate filaments and microtubules . There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis. [ 10 ] 
 Genetic material 
 Two different kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Most cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA ) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation . 
 Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome ) in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory ). 
 A human cell has genetic material contained in the cell nucleus (the nuclear genome ) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome ). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes , including 22 homologous chromosome pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes . The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs. 
 Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called transfection . This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's genome , or stable, if it is. Certain viruses also insert their genetic material into the genome. 
 Organelles 
 Main article: Organelle 
 The human body contains many different organs , such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function. Cells also have a set of "little organs," called organelles , that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles but organelles in eukaryotes are generally more complex and may be membrane bound. 
 There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and golgi apparatus ) are typically solitary, while others (such as mitochondria , peroxisomes and lysosomes ) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles. 
 
 
 
  
Diagram of a cell nucleus 
 
 
 
 Cell nucleus – eukaryotes only - A cell's information center, the cell nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes , and is the place where almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis ( transcription ) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope . The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed , or copied into a special RNA , called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The nucleolus is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm . 
 Mitochondria and Chloroplasts – eukaryotes only - the power generators: Mitochondria are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria generate the cell's energy by oxidative phosphorylation , using oxygen to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to glucose ) to generate ATP . Mitochondria multiply by splitting in two. Respiration occurs in the cell mitochondria. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make ATP.

 Endoplasmic reticulum – eukaryotes only: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm, and the smooth ER, which lacks them. Smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release. [ citation needed ] 
 Golgi apparatus – eukaryotes only&#160;: The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell. [ citation needed ] 
 Ribosomes : The ribosome is a large complex of RNA and protein molecules. They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes). [ 11 ] 
 Lysosomes and Peroxisomes – eukaryotes only: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases ). They digest excess or worn-out organelles , food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria . Peroxisomes have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic peroxides . The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. [ citation needed ] 
 Centrosome – the cytoskeleton organiser: The centrosome produces the microtubules of a cell – a key component of the cytoskeleton . It directs the transport through the ER and the Golgi apparatus . Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles , which separate during cell division and help in the formation of the mitotic spindle . A single centrosome is present in the animal cells . They are also found in some fungi and algae cells. [ citation needed ] 
 Vacuoles : Vacuoles store food and waste. Some vacuoles store extra water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of eukaryotic cells are usually larger in those of plants than animals. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Structures outside the cell membrane 
 Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the impermeable cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures export processes to carry macromolecules across the cell membrane must be used. 
 Cell wall 
 Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell have a cell wall . The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of pectin, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan. 
 Prokaryotic 
 Capsule 
 A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci , meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or hyaluronic acid as in streptococci . [ citation needed ] Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by special stain . [ citation needed ] 
 Flagella 
 Flagella are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. Are most commonly found in bacteria cells but are found in animal cells as well. 
 Fimbriae (pili) 
 They are short and thin hair like filaments, formed of protein called pilin (antigenic). Fimbriae are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (adherence). There are special types of pili called (sex pili) involved in conjunction. [ citation needed ] 
 Growth and metabolism 
 Main articles: Cell growth and Metabolism 
 Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: catabolism , in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and anabolism , in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions. Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically complex sugar molecule called glucose . Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), a form of energy, through two different pathways. 
 The first pathway, glycolysis , requires no oxygen and is referred to as anaerobic metabolism . Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy. 
 The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle , occurs inside the mitochondria and can generate enough ATP to run all the cell functions. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 An overview of protein synthesis. 
Within the nucleus of the cell ( light blue ), genes (DNA, dark blue ) are transcribed into RNA . This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature mRNA ( red ) that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm ( peach ), where it undergoes translation into a protein. mRNA is translated by ribosomes ( purple ) that match the three-base codons of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate tRNA . Newly synthesized proteins ( black ) are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule ( orange ), to become fully active. 
 
 
 Self-replication 
 Main article: Cell division 
 Cell division involves a single cell (called a mother cell ) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue ) and to procreation ( vegetative reproduction ) in unicellular organisms . 
 Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission . Eukaryotic cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called mitosis , followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis . A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells. 
 DNA replication , or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. 
 In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before meiosis I . DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in meiosis II . [ 12 ] Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job. 
 Protein synthesis 
 Main article: Protein biosynthesis 
 Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: transcription and translation . 
 Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol , where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule. 
 Movement or motility 
 Cells can move during many processes: such as wound healing, the immune response and cancer metastasis . For wound healing to occur, white blood cells and cells that ingest bacteria move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. 
At the same time fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) move there to remodel damaged structures. In the case of tumor development, cells from a primary tumor move away and spread to other parts of the body. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins. [ 13 ] The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton. [ 14 ]  [ 15 ] 
 Origins 
 Main article: Evolutionary history of life 
 The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the history of life on Earth. 
 Origin of the first cell 
 Further information: Abiogenesis 
 There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that could lead to life in an early Earth. One is that they came from meteorites ( see Murchison meteorite ). Another is that they were created at deep-sea vents . A third is that they were synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere ( see Miller–Urey experiment ); although it is not clear if Earth had such an atmosphere. There are essentially no experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. RNA is generally assumed the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions ( see RNA world hypothesis ). But some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, like clay or peptide nucleic acid . [ 16 ] 
 Cells emerged at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. The current belief is that these cells were heterotrophs . An important characteristic of cells is the cell membrane , composed of a bilayer of lipids . The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form. [ 17 ] 
 Origin of eukaryotic cells 
 Further information: Evolution of sexual reproduction 
 The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are almost certainly what remains of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria , respectively, where the rest of the cell appears derived from an ancestral archaean prokaryote cell—an idea called the endosymbiotic theory . 
 There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the hydrogenosome predated the origin of mitochondria , or viceversa: see the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. 
 Sex, as the stereotyped choreography of meiosis and syngamy that persists in nearly all extant eukaryotes, may have played a role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. An 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory suggests that the eukaryote genome accreted from prokaryan parasite genomes in numerous rounds of lateral gene transfer. Sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing co-evolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that conveyed protection against horizontal infection by more virulent symbionts. [ 18 ] 
 History of research 
 
 1632–1723: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek teaches himself to make lenses , constructs simple microscopes and draws protozoa , such as Vorticella from rain water, and bacteria from his own mouth. 
 1665: Robert Hooke discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope. [ 6 ] 
 1839: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory. 
 1855: Rudolf Virchow states that cells always emerge from cell divisions ( omnis cellula ex cellula ). 
 1859: The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously ( generatio spontanea ) is contradicted by Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) (although Francesco Redi had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion). 
 1931: Ernst Ruska builds first transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the University of Berlin . By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles. 
 1953: Watson and Crick made their first announcement on the double- helix structure for DNA on February 28. 
 1981: Lynn Margulis published Symbiosis in Cell Evolution detailing the endosymbiotic theory .

The cells of eukaryotes (left) and prokaryotes (right) 
 
 
 The cell is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known living organisms . It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing (except virus , which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ), and is often called the building block of life. 
 It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . [ 1 ] Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including most bacteria ) or multicellular (including plants and animals ). 
 While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, Humans contain about 100 trillion (10 14 ) cells. [ 2 ] Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100&#160; micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope. [ 3 ] 
 The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that all cells come from preexisting cells, that vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. [ 4 ] Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. 
 The word cell comes from the Latin cella , meaning "small room". [ 5 ] The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in. [ 6 ]

Diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell 
 
 
 The prokaryote cell is simpler, and therefore smaller, than a eukaryote cell, lacking a nucleus and most of the other organelles of eukaryotes. There are two kinds of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea ; these share a similar structure. 
 The nuclear material of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm . Here, the undefined nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid . 
 A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions: 
 
 On the outside, flagella and pili project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells. 
 Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope – generally consisting of a cell wall covering a plasma membrane though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a capsule . The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. Though most prokaryotes have a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea). The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and finally bursting ( cytolysis ) from osmotic pressure against a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryote cells ( plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall. 
 Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the cell genome (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. A prokaryotic chromosome is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi , which causes Lyme disease). [ 8 ] Though not forming a nucleus , the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid . Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids , which are usually circular. Plasmids enable additional functions, such as antibiotic resistance . 
 
 Eukaryotic cells 
 Main article: Eukaryote 
 Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic . These cells are about 15 times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus , a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true nucleus." Other differences include: 
 
 The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present. 
 The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes , which are associated with histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the cell nucleus , separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria also contain some DNA. 
 Many eukaryotic cells are ciliated with primary cilia . Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, mechanosensation , and thermosensation. Cilia may thus be "viewed as sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation." [ 9 ] 
 Eukaryotes can move using motile cilia or flagella . The flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.

 Subcellular components 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic , have a membrane that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells (except red blood cells which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin ) possess DNA , the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function. 
 Membrane 
 Main article: Cell membrane 
 The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a cell membrane or plasma membrane . The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a cell wall . This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of lipids ( hydrophobic fat-like molecules) and hydrophilic phosphorus molecules. Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer , or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ( molecule or ion ) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones . 
 Cytoskeleton 
 Main article: Cytoskeleton

 The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis , the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis , the separation of daughter cells after cell division ; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments , intermediate filaments and microtubules . There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis. [ 10 ] 
 Genetic material 
 Two different kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Most cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA ) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation . 
 Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome ) in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory ). 
 A human cell has genetic material contained in the cell nucleus (the nuclear genome ) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome ). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes , including 22 homologous chromosome pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes . The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs. 
 Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called transfection . This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's genome , or stable, if it is. Certain viruses also insert their genetic material into the genome. 
 Organelles 
 Main article: Organelle 
 The human body contains many different organs , such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function. Cells also have a set of "little organs," called organelles , that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles but organelles in eukaryotes are generally more complex and may be membrane bound. 
 There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and golgi apparatus ) are typically solitary, while others (such as mitochondria , peroxisomes and lysosomes ) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles. 
 
 
 
  
Diagram of a cell nucleus 
 
 
 
 Cell nucleus – eukaryotes only - A cell's information center, the cell nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes , and is the place where almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis ( transcription ) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope . The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed , or copied into a special RNA , called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The nucleolus is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm . 
 Mitochondria and Chloroplasts – eukaryotes only - the power generators: Mitochondria are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria generate the cell's energy by oxidative phosphorylation , using oxygen to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to glucose ) to generate ATP . Mitochondria multiply by splitting in two. Respiration occurs in the cell mitochondria. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make ATP. 
 
 
 
 
  
Diagram of an endomembrane system 
 
 
 
 Endoplasmic reticulum – eukaryotes only: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm, and the smooth ER, which lacks them. Smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release. [ citation needed ] 
 Golgi apparatus – eukaryotes only&#160;: The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell. [ citation needed ] 
 Ribosomes : The ribosome is a large complex of RNA and protein molecules. They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes). [ 11 ] 
 Lysosomes and Peroxisomes – eukaryotes only: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases ). They digest excess or worn-out organelles , food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria . Peroxisomes have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic peroxides . The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. [ citation needed ] 
 Centrosome – the cytoskeleton organiser: The centrosome produces the microtubules of a cell – a key component of the cytoskeleton . It directs the transport through the ER and the Golgi apparatus . Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles , which separate during cell division and help in the formation of the mitotic spindle . A single centrosome is present in the animal cells . They are also found in some fungi and algae cells. [ citation needed ] 
 Vacuoles : Vacuoles store food and waste. Some vacuoles store extra water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of eukaryotic cells are usually larger in those of plants than animals. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Structures outside the cell membrane 
 Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the impermeable cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures export processes to carry macromolecules across the cell membrane must be used. 
 Cell wall 
 Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell have a cell wall . The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of pectin, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan. 
 Prokaryotic 
 Capsule 
 A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci , meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or hyaluronic acid as in streptococci . [ citation needed ] Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by special stain . [ citation needed ] 
 Flagella 
 Flagella are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. Are most commonly found in bacteria cells but are found in animal cells as well. 
 Fimbriae (pili) 
 They are short and thin hair like filaments, formed of protein called pilin (antigenic). Fimbriae are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (adherence). There are special types of pili called (sex pili) involved in conjunction. [ citation needed ] 
 Growth and metabolism 
 Main articles: Cell growth and Metabolism 
 Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: catabolism , in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and anabolism , in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions. Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically complex sugar molecule called glucose . Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), a form of energy, through two different pathways. 
 The first pathway, glycolysis , requires no oxygen and is referred to as anaerobic metabolism . Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy. 
 The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle , occurs inside the mitochondria and can generate enough ATP to run all the cell functions. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 An overview of protein synthesis. 
Within the nucleus of the cell ( light blue ), genes (DNA, dark blue ) are transcribed into RNA . This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature mRNA ( red ) that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm ( peach ), where it undergoes translation into a protein. mRNA is translated by ribosomes ( purple ) that match the three-base codons of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate tRNA . Newly synthesized proteins ( black ) are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule ( orange ), to become fully active. 
 
 
 Self-replication 
 Main article: Cell division 
 Cell division involves a single cell (called a mother cell ) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue ) and to procreation ( vegetative reproduction ) in unicellular organisms . 
 Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission . Eukaryotic cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called mitosis , followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis . A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells. 
 DNA replication , or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. 
 In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before meiosis I . DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in meiosis II . [ 12 ] Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job. 
 Protein synthesis 
 Main article: Protein biosynthesis 
 Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: transcription and translation . 
 Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol , where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule. 
 Movement or motility 
 Cells can move during many processes: such as wound healing, the immune response and cancer metastasis . For wound healing to occur, white blood cells and cells that ingest bacteria move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. 
At the same time fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) move there to remodel damaged structures. In the case of tumor development, cells from a primary tumor move away and spread to other parts of the body. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins. [ 13 ] The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton. [ 14 ]  [ 15 ] 
 Origins 
 Main article: Evolutionary history of life 
 The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the history of life on Earth. 
 Origin of the first cell 
 Further information: Abiogenesis 
 There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that could lead to life in an early Earth. One is that they came from meteorites ( see Murchison meteorite ). Another is that they were created at deep-sea vents . A third is that they were synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere ( see Miller–Urey experiment ); although it is not clear if Earth had such an atmosphere. There are essentially no experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. RNA is generally assumed the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions ( see RNA world hypothesis ). But some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, like clay or peptide nucleic acid . [ 16 ] 
 Cells emerged at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. The current belief is that these cells were heterotrophs . An important characteristic of cells is the cell membrane , composed of a bilayer of lipids . The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form. [ 17 ] 
 Origin of eukaryotic cells 
 Further information: Evolution of sexual reproduction 
 The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are almost certainly what remains of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria , respectively, where the rest of the cell appears derived from an ancestral archaean prokaryote cell—an idea called the endosymbiotic theory . 
 There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the hydrogenosome predated the origin of mitochondria , or viceversa: see the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. 
 Sex, as the stereotyped choreography of meiosis and syngamy that persists in nearly all extant eukaryotes, may have played a role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. An 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory suggests that the eukaryote genome accreted from prokaryan parasite genomes in numerous rounds of lateral gene transfer. Sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing co-evolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that conveyed protection against horizontal infection by more virulent symbionts. [ 18 ] 
 History of research 
 
 1632–1723: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek teaches himself to make lenses , constructs simple microscopes and draws protozoa , such as Vorticella from rain water, and bacteria from his own mouth. 
 1665: Robert Hooke discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope. [ 6 ] 
 1839: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory. 
 1855: Rudolf Virchow states that cells always emerge from cell divisions ( omnis cellula ex cellula ). 
 1859: The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously ( generatio spontanea ) is contradicted by Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) (although Francesco Redi had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion). 
 1931: Ernst Ruska builds first transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the University of Berlin . By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles. 
 1953: Watson and Crick made their first announcement on the double- helix structure for DNA on February 28. 
 1981: Lynn Margulis published Symbiosis in Cell Evolution detailing the endosymbiotic theory .

The cells of eukaryotes (left) and prokaryotes (right) 
 
 
 The cell is the basic structural, functional and biological unit of all known living organisms . It is the smallest unit of life that is classified as a living thing (except virus , which consists only from DNA/RNA covered by protein and lipids ), and is often called the building block of life. 
 It consists of a protoplasm enclosed within a membrane, which contains many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids . [ 1 ] Organisms can be classified as unicellular (consisting of a single cell; including most bacteria ) or multicellular (including plants and animals ). 
 While the number of cells in plants and animals varies from species to species, Humans contain about 100 trillion (10 14 ) cells. [ 2 ] Most plant and animal cells are between 1 and 100&#160; micrometres and therefore are visible only under the microscope. [ 3 ] 
 The cell was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1665. The cell theory , first developed in 1839 by Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann , states that all organisms are composed of one or more cells, that all cells come from preexisting cells, that vital functions of an organism occur within cells, and that all cells contain the hereditary information necessary for regulating cell functions and for transmitting information to the next generation of cells. [ 4 ] Cells emerged on planet Earth at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. 
 The word cell comes from the Latin cella , meaning "small room". [ 5 ] The descriptive term for the smallest living biological structure was coined by Robert Hooke in a book he published in 1665 when he compared the cork cells he saw through his microscope to the small rooms monks lived in.

Diagram of a typical prokaryotic cell 
 
 
 The prokaryote cell is simpler, and therefore smaller, than a eukaryote cell, lacking a nucleus and most of the other organelles of eukaryotes. There are two kinds of prokaryotes: bacteria and archaea ; these share a similar structure. 
 The nuclear material of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single chromosome that is in direct contact with the cytoplasm . Here, the undefined nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the nucleoid . 
 A prokaryotic cell has three architectural regions: 
 
 On the outside, flagella and pili project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells. 
 Enclosing the cell is the cell envelope – generally consisting of a cell wall covering a plasma membrane though some bacteria also have a further covering layer called a capsule . The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. Though most prokaryotes have a cell wall, there are exceptions such as Mycoplasma (bacteria) and Thermoplasma (archaea). The cell wall consists of peptidoglycan in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and finally bursting ( cytolysis ) from osmotic pressure against a hypotonic environment. Some eukaryote cells ( plant cells and fungal cells) also have a cell wall. 
 Inside the cell is the cytoplasmic region that contains the cell genome (DNA) and ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions. A prokaryotic chromosome is usually a circular molecule (an exception is that of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi , which causes Lyme disease). [ 8 ] Though not forming a nucleus , the DNA is condensed in a nucleoid . Prokaryotes can carry extrachromosomal DNA elements called plasmids , which are usually circular. Plasmids enable additional functions, such as antibiotic resistance . 
 
 Eukaryotic cells 
 Main article: Eukaryote 
 Plants, animals, fungi, slime moulds, protozoa, and algae are all eukaryotic . These cells are about 15 times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as 1000 times greater in volume. The major difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound compartments in which specific metabolic activities take place. Most important among these is a cell nucleus , a membrane-delineated compartment that houses the eukaryotic cell's DNA. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true nucleus." Other differences include: 
 
 The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present. 
 The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called chromosomes , which are associated with histone proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the cell nucleus , separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane. Some eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria also contain some DNA. 
 Many eukaryotic cells are ciliated with primary cilia . Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, mechanosensation , and thermosensation. Cilia may thus be "viewed as sensory cellular antennae that coordinate a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation." [ 9 ] 
 Eukaryotes can move using motile cilia or flagella . The flagella are more complex than those of prokaryotes.

 Subcellular components 
 All cells, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic , have a membrane that envelops the cell, separates its interior from its environment, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the electric potential of the cell . Inside the membrane, a salty cytoplasm takes up most of the cell volume. All cells (except red blood cells which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin ) possess DNA , the hereditary material of genes , and RNA , containing the information necessary to build various proteins such as enzymes , the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of biomolecules in cells. This article lists these primary components of the cell, then briefly describe their function. 
 Membrane 
 Main article: Cell membrane 
 The cytoplasm of a cell is surrounded by a cell membrane or plasma membrane . The plasma membrane in plants and prokaryotes is usually covered by a cell wall . This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a double layer of lipids ( hydrophobic fat-like molecules) and hydrophilic phosphorus molecules. Hence, the layer is called a phospholipid bilayer , or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a variety of protein molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell. The membrane is said to be 'semi-permeable', in that it can either let a substance ( molecule or ion ) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain receptor proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as hormones . 
 Cytoskeleton 
 Main article: Cytoskeleton 
 
 
 
  
Bovine Pulmonary Artery Endothelial cell: nuclei stained blue, mitochondria stained red, and F-actin , an important component in microfilaments, stained green. Cell imaged on a fluorescent microscope. 
 
 
 The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis , the uptake of external materials by a cell, and cytokinesis , the separation of daughter cells after cell division ; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments , intermediate filaments and microtubules . There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and cytokinesis. [ 10 ] 
 Genetic material 
 Two different kinds of genetic material exist: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). Most cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA sequence. RNA is used for information transport (e.g., mRNA ) and enzymatic functions (e.g., ribosomal RNA). Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein translation . 
 Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple circular DNA molecule (the bacterial chromosome ) in the nucleoid region of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different, linear molecules called chromosomes inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts (see endosymbiotic theory ). 
 A human cell has genetic material contained in the cell nucleus (the nuclear genome ) and in the mitochondria (the mitochondrial genome ). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called chromosomes , including 22 homologous chromosome pairs and a pair of sex chromosomes . The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the mitochondrial DNA is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes, it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs. 
 Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called transfection . This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's genome , or stable, if it is. Certain viruses also insert their genetic material into the genome. 
 Organelles 
 Main article: Organelle 
 The human body contains many different organs , such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function. Cells also have a set of "little organs," called organelles , that are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles but organelles in eukaryotes are generally more complex and may be membrane bound. 
 There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the nucleus and golgi apparatus ) are typically solitary, while others (such as mitochondria , peroxisomes and lysosomes ) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The cytosol is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles. 
 
 
 
  
Diagram of a cell nucleus 
 
 
 
 Cell nucleus – eukaryotes only - A cell's information center, the cell nucleus is the most conspicuous organelle found in a eukaryotic cell. It houses the cell's chromosomes , and is the place where almost all DNA replication and RNA synthesis ( transcription ) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope . The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, DNA is transcribed , or copied into a special RNA , called messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The nucleolus is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the cytoplasm . 
 Mitochondria and Chloroplasts – eukaryotes only - the power generators: Mitochondria are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. Mitochondria play a critical role in generating energy in the eukaryotic cell. Mitochondria generate the cell's energy by oxidative phosphorylation , using oxygen to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to glucose ) to generate ATP . Mitochondria multiply by splitting in two. Respiration occurs in the cell mitochondria. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make ATP.

 Endoplasmic reticulum – eukaryotes only: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface and secretes proteins into the cytoplasm, and the smooth ER, which lacks them. Smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release. [ citation needed ] 
 Golgi apparatus – eukaryotes only&#160;: The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the macromolecules such as proteins and lipids that are synthesized by the cell. [ citation needed ] 
 Ribosomes : The ribosome is a large complex of RNA and protein molecules. They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes). [ 11 ] 
 Lysosomes and Peroxisomes – eukaryotes only: Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes (acid hydrolases ). They digest excess or worn-out organelles , food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria . Peroxisomes have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic peroxides . The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system. [ citation needed ] 
 Centrosome – the cytoskeleton organiser: The centrosome produces the microtubules of a cell – a key component of the cytoskeleton . It directs the transport through the ER and the Golgi apparatus . Centrosomes are composed of two centrioles , which separate during cell division and help in the formation of the mitotic spindle . A single centrosome is present in the animal cells . They are also found in some fungi and algae cells. [ citation needed ] 
 Vacuoles : Vacuoles store food and waste. Some vacuoles store extra water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably Amoeba , have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of eukaryotic cells are usually larger in those of plants than animals. [ citation needed ] 
 
 Structures outside the cell membrane 
 Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the impermeable cell membrane. In order to assemble these structures export processes to carry macromolecules across the cell membrane must be used. 
 Cell wall 
 Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell have a cell wall . The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of pectin, fungi cell walls are made up of chitin and bacteria cell walls are made up of peptidoglycan. 
 Prokaryotic 
 Capsule 
 A gelatinous capsule is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be polysaccharide as in pneumococci , meningococci or polypeptide as Bacillus anthracis or hyaluronic acid as in streptococci . [ citation needed ] Capsules are not marked by normal staining protocols and can be detected by special stain . [ citation needed ] 
 Flagella 
 Flagella are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. Are most commonly found in bacteria cells but are found in animal cells as well. 
 Fimbriae (pili) 
 They are short and thin hair like filaments, formed of protein called pilin (antigenic). Fimbriae are responsible for attachment of bacteria to specific receptors of human cell (adherence). There are special types of pili called (sex pili) involved in conjunction. [ citation needed ] 
 Growth and metabolism 
 Main articles: Cell growth and Metabolism 
 Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: catabolism , in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and reducing power, and anabolism , in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions. Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into a less chemically complex sugar molecule called glucose . Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), a form of energy, through two different pathways. 
 The first pathway, glycolysis , requires no oxygen and is referred to as anaerobic metabolism . Each reaction is designed to produce some hydrogen ions that can then be used to make energy packets (ATP). In prokaryotes, glycolysis is the only method used for converting energy. 
 The second pathway, called the Krebs cycle, or citric acid cycle , occurs inside the mitochondria and can generate enough ATP to run all the cell functions. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 An overview of protein synthesis. 
Within the nucleus of the cell ( light blue ), genes (DNA, dark blue ) are transcribed into RNA . This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature mRNA ( red ) that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm ( peach ), where it undergoes translation into a protein. mRNA is translated by ribosomes ( purple ) that match the three-base codons of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate tRNA . Newly synthesized proteins ( black ) are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule ( orange ), to become fully active. 
 
 
 Self-replication 
 Main article: Cell division 
 Cell division involves a single cell (called a mother cell ) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue ) and to procreation ( vegetative reproduction ) in unicellular organisms . 
 Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission . Eukaryotic cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called mitosis , followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis . A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells. 
 DNA replication , or the process of duplicating a cell's genome, always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. 
 In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before meiosis I . DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in meiosis II . [ 12 ] Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job. 
 Protein synthesis 
 Main article: Protein biosynthesis 
 Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: transcription and translation . 
 Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give messenger RNA (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called ribosomes located in the cytosol , where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to transfer RNA (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule. 
 Movement or motility 
 Cells can move during many processes: such as wound healing, the immune response and cancer metastasis . For wound healing to occur, white blood cells and cells that ingest bacteria move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. 
At the same time fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) move there to remodel damaged structures. In the case of tumor development, cells from a primary tumor move away and spread to other parts of the body. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins. [ 13 ] The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton. [ 14 ]  [ 15 ] 
 Origins 
 Main article: Evolutionary history of life 
 The origin of cells has to do with the origin of life, which began the history of life on Earth. 
 Origin of the first cell 
 Further information: Abiogenesis 
 There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that could lead to life in an early Earth. One is that they came from meteorites ( see Murchison meteorite ). Another is that they were created at deep-sea vents . A third is that they were synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere ( see Miller–Urey experiment ); although it is not clear if Earth had such an atmosphere. There are essentially no experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. RNA is generally assumed the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions ( see RNA world hypothesis ). But some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, like clay or peptide nucleic acid . [ 16 ] 
 Cells emerged at least 4.0–4.3 billion years ago. The current belief is that these cells were heterotrophs . An important characteristic of cells is the cell membrane , composed of a bilayer of lipids . The early cell membranes were probably more simple and permeable than modern ones, with only a single fatty acid chain per lipid. Lipids are known to spontaneously form bilayered vesicles in water, and could have preceded RNA, but the first cell membranes could also have been produced by catalytic RNA, or even have required structural proteins before they could form. [ 17 ] 
 Origin of eukaryotic cells 
 Further information: Evolution of sexual reproduction 
 The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a symbiotic community of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the mitochondria and the chloroplasts are almost certainly what remains of ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing proteobacteria and cyanobacteria , respectively, where the rest of the cell appears derived from an ancestral archaean prokaryote cell—an idea called the endosymbiotic theory . 
 There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the hydrogenosome predated the origin of mitochondria , or viceversa: see the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotic cells. 
 Sex, as the stereotyped choreography of meiosis and syngamy that persists in nearly all extant eukaryotes, may have played a role in the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. An 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory suggests that the eukaryote genome accreted from prokaryan parasite genomes in numerous rounds of lateral gene transfer. Sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose when infected hosts began swapping nuclearized genomes containing co-evolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that conveyed protection against horizontal infection by more virulent symbionts. [ 18 ] 
 History of research 
 
 1632–1723: Antonie van Leeuwenhoek teaches himself to make lenses , constructs simple microscopes and draws protozoa , such as Vorticella from rain water, and bacteria from his own mouth. 
 1665: Robert Hooke discovers cells in cork, then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope. [ 6 ] 
 1839: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden elucidate the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory. 
 1855: Rudolf Virchow states that cells always emerge from cell divisions ( omnis cellula ex cellula ). 
 1859: The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously ( generatio spontanea ) is contradicted by Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) (although Francesco Redi had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion). 
 1931: Ernst Ruska builds first transmission electron microscope (TEM) at the University of Berlin . By 1935, he has built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles. 
 1953: Watson and Crick made their first announcement on the double- helix structure for DNA on February 28. 
 1981: Lynn Margulis published Symbiosis in Cell Evolution detailing the endosymbiotic theory .

     Abstract 
     
     Motivation: Cell lines are used extensively in biomedical research, but the nomenclature describing cell lines has not been standardized.
      The problems are both linguistic and experimental. Many ambiguous cell line names appear in the published literature. Users
      of the same cell line may refer to it in different ways, and cell lines may mutate or become contaminated without the knowledge
      of the user. As a first step towards rationalizing this nomenclature, we created a cell line knowledgebase (CLKB) with a well-structured
      collection of names and descriptive data for cell lines cultured in vitro . The objectives of this work are: (i) to assist users in extracting useful information from biomedical text and (ii) to highlight
      the importance of standardizing cell line names in biomedical research. This CLKB contains a broad collection of cell line
      names compiled from ATCC, Hyper CLDB and MeSH. In addition to names, the knowledgebase specifies relationships between cell
      lines. We analyze the use of cell line names in biomedical text. Issues include ambiguous names, polymorphisms in the use
      of names and the fact that some cell line names are also common English words. Linguistic patterns associated with the occurrence
      of cell line names are analyzed. Applying these patterns to find additional cell line names in the literature identifies only
      a small number of additional names. Annotation of microarray gene expression studies is used as a test case. The CLKB facilitates
      data exploration and comparison of different cell lines in support of clinical and experimental research.

     1 INTRODUCTION 
     
     Cells cultured in vitro are powerful and convenient model systems that are widely used in biomedical research. In the past year alone, some 30 000
      papers were published on work using cell lines. Often, a great deal of biological information is associated with the particular
      cell line used for analysis, and knowledge of this context is important to fully understand the implication of a publication.
      The rapid growth of biotechnology and biomedical research is generating massive collections of free text data that would benefit
      from improved data organization and management. In this article, we describe a simple ontology structure that underlies this
      knowledgebase for cell lines and its application to machine-assisted analysis of biomedical literature.
     
     
     The names of cell lines grown in culture are frequently generated by the laboratory of origin and have not been subject to
      systematic organization. As a result, the nomenclature is inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous. For instance, there are numerous
      examples where the same name is applied to at least two different cell lines and many cases where different names are applied
      to a single cell line. Improved organization of cell line names would be beneficial to the clinical and experimental research
      communities. Traditionally, a researcher decides on which cell line he/she will use in addressing the question at hand based
      on historical knowledge (‘what is known to work under the given condition?’). However, in scientific research, the original
      plan may not work out and different approaches need to be considered. Thus, researchers often need to explore alternative
      cell lines and to access information about these cell lines in planning their experiments. Repositories of cell lines exist,
      and names used by these repositories provide a useful starting point for a nomenclature. Although repositories typically retain
      the name provided by the original developer of a cell line, they often add catalog numbers or other de facto synonyms, further complicating matters. The nature of how cell lines are used in biomedical research leads us to the classic
      informatics question ‘How can we transform text data with cell line names into well-structured information about these cell
      lines?’ Another issue in information management is quality assurance and quality control, ‘How do we know if we are looking
      at an accurate set of data?’ Even though there exists an ontology for related information of cell types and other biomedical
      artifacts (Bard et al. , 2005 ; Shulz et al. , 2006 ), we are still missing another important component of cell line information; and thus, our attempt to create a cell line
      knowledgebase (CLKB). During the construction of CLKB, we have encountered issues that need to be addressed in the community
      in order to create structured knowledge about cell lines to answer questions in information-seeking domains. The structure
      of GENIA ontology also suggests that cell line information from our CLKB can be integrated to create an enhanced network of
      information (Rinaldi et al. , 2006 ; Shulz et al. , 2006 ).
     
    
    
      Previous Section Next Section 
     2 METHODS 
     
     The CLKB is an initial attempt to normalize the cell line nomenclature. We draw data from Hyper Cell Line Data Base (HyperCLDB)
      version 4.200201 ( http://www.biotech.ist.unige.it/interlab/cldb.html ) (Manniello et al. , 1996 ; Parodi et al. , 1993 ; Romano et al. , 1993 ), and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) cell line catalog (available online at http://www.atcc.org/common/documents/pdf/CellCatalog/CellIndex.pdf as of November 2006), and link names derived from these collections to the National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings
      (NLM MeSH, 2007 ). The focus of this project lies in permanent cell lines, not primary cells. HyperCLDB html files were downloaded and stored
      in a local storage for data processing. A python script was written to parse out cell line names and their corresponding organism,
      tissue, pathology and tumor information, and store the information on our database server. There were 6609 cell line records
      including duplicates (cell lines with the same label deposited by multiple laboratories) on HyperCLDB. The collection was
      then processed to eliminate duplicates keeping only one record for a specific cell line name with reference pointers to the
      name duplicates. The unique-name version of HyperCLDB contained 5888 distinct cell lines.
     
     
     All data were processed in a case-sensitive manner; in the non-standardized cell line annotation across different laboratories,
      capitalization may signify different representations for different cell lines. Thus, we could not normalize capitalization
      for natural language processing. On the other hand, different capitalization of the same spelling often does not indicate
      different cell lines. Such variants are treated as synonyms of the cell line name as shown in Table 1 . An advanced algorithm for machine learning would be required in this case. The capitalization inconsistency was manually
      examined and curated at a later stage, as the machine could not easily distinguish the differences without human intervention
      (e.g. the case of Hep-2 and HEp-2). ATCC cell lines were converted from PDF format to Microsoft Excel file format. We manipulated
      the data obtained from ATCC catalog on Microsoft Excel utilizing VBA macro rather than other programming scripts, as some
      of the ATCC cell line names contained Unicode characters. Implementing text processing using Python or Perl scripting does
      not usually handle Unicode characters, and converting Unicode encrypting to another workable format adds complexity to calculation
      (see Supplementary Material ). A total of 3488 cell lines were extracted from ATCC catalog.

      Table 1. 
       Examples of synonymous cell lines 
       
      
     
     
     The attributes for each ATCC cell line were cell line name, ATCC number, species, source/application, morphology and growth
      mode. The information stored in association with each ATCC cell line was then processed to a format compatible with the HyperCLDB
      dataset. After text processing, each cell line record has the attributes of CellLineID, Organism, Tissue, Pathology, Growth
      Mode, Repository Source, ATCC Number, HyperCLDB html and MeshID. For each attribute used in an individual record, standard
      nomenclature is applied to normalize textual content for a better organization of the knowledgebase (i.e. we try to use a
      controlled list of vocabulary to describe definition of terms being used in the knowledgebase; e.g. using NCBI taxonomy to
      describe organism, using NCBI MeSH terms where applicable, etc.)
     
     
     The 8914 cell line names from both sources were combined in alphanumeric order. Cell lines that appear to share similar names
      (but different punctuation marks, and/or space) are examined; if they share the same characteristics (same CellLineID, Organism,
      Tissue and Pathology), the entries are merged to one primary entry and its cross-reference identifiers are stored in our data
      table. If a group of names appear to share only the similar names but their characteristics differ, the entries are kept as
      is. Table 1 provides examples of merged names. Repository source is the name of primary source that the cell line is taken from. If related
      names for a single cell line exist in both repositories, we use ATCC as the primary repository source because ATCC is a widely
      used source of cell lines and their database is dynamically maintained and curated. Note that the construction of this CLKB
      aims to rationalize the nomenclature so that it represents the actual cell lines. At least one of the identifier attributes
      of the primary repository source (ATCC number, or HyperCLDB html) must be present for each cell line entry. Some cell line
      names that exist in multiple sources contain the identifier(s) for each source as cross-references. ATCC number is the ATCC
      catalog number. HyperCLDB identifiers are the original html file names as taken from the base URL ( http://www.biotech.ist.unige.it/cldb/*.html ). A few cell lines are also listed in NCBI MeSH collection. These cell lines also have the corresponding value in their MeSH
      identifier attributes.

     3 RESULTS 
     
     The structure of this CLKB was constructed using Protégé (Noy et al. , 2000 , 2003 ). After manual review, we were left with 8740 unique-name entries. A Java script was implemented to automate the instance
      creation in a W3C Web Ontology Language format (OWL-DL file extension).
     
     
     3.1 Cell line knowledgebase 
     
     The primary aim of building the CLKB is to facilitate research using cell cultures. Therefore, in addition to the simple underlying
      ontology structure, CLKB contains information on cell line culture, availability and biological characteristics. We have constructed
      an online web interface that queries the CLKB. The URL for this knowledgebase is http://clkb.ncibi.org/ . This CLKB is a public data warehouse for searching cell line data extracted from ATCC and HyperCLDB as described previously.
      Constructing this knowledgebase also leads us to the next application of this CLKB, ontology mapping. Often, information can
      be linked from other sources. For example, the mapping by string literals of attribute ‘Tissue’ in cell line to the Cell Type
      Ontology (Bard et al. , 2005 ). There are 8473 cell lines (out of the total 8740 instances in this knowledgebase), each of which has the attribute ‘Tissue’
      that can be mapped to cell-type name in Cell Type Ontology using exact-string alignment method. There are 265 cell line instances
      that do not have tissue information (Tissue = NULL). This leaves us with only two cell line instances where their tissue attribute
      cannot be automatically mapped to a cell-type name (SVEC4-10EE2 and SVEC4-10EHR1). Even these two remaining cases could be
      mapped when extraneous blanks were removed from their tissue attribute values. This preliminary CLKB—Cell Type Ontology mapping
      clearly demonstrates a promising solution and is a step towards building the ‘biomedical knowledge network’.
     
     
     3.2 Data structure 
     
     In the CLKB, there are two distinct entity types, ‘CellLine’ and ‘RepositorySource’. A knowledgebase contains both classes
      and instances. A cell line is defined as a class. An instance of a cell line is a culture of that class of cells maintained
      by a particular vendor or laboratory. A cell line entity contains the attributes as described. A repository entry contains
      the information of Repository association class, and the URL in which the cell line refers to (html indicator for HyperCLDB
      instances, and ATCC catalog PDF for ATCC instances). The CLKB was developed with these processed data as outlined in Figure 1 . The majority of cell lines are stand-alone entities, and we include a link to their source of origin.

     A number of cell lines are derivatives of some common cell lines. These cell lines contain the ‘isDerivedFrom’ relationship
      to the parent cell line, and the parent cell line could have one or more ‘hasDerivatives’ relationships as well. Derivatives
      at the same level are considered ‘homologs’ (for example, multiple clones derived from a common parent cell line, thus there
      must first be a common parent in the dataset). Determination of derivatives was based on explicit information in the cell
      line name field (e.g. the word ‘subclone’). Although there may have been indicators other than this explicit statement for
      cell line derivatives, we intentionally did not include these rules in our automated script as the common substring approach
      could be misleading. We do not want to identify a cell line as a derivative for another cell line when it was not a true derivative
      (e.g. a substring in a cell line name may be just a manufacturer's abbreviation and a system-generated number). To avoid this
      foreseen issue, we decided to leave out other clonal implications that are not explicitly stated in the cell line names.
     
     
     The CLKB can be viewed in most ontology editors that are capable of processing W3C Web Ontology Language file format (.OWL
      extension). A screenshot from Protégé ontology editor of this knowledgebase is also shown in Figure 2 . There are likely going to be more novel cell line information available from various sources, we encourage the use of an
      ontology editor in merging these cell lines into our current version (for example, Protégé as we have successfully worked
      with in this project— http://protege.stanford.edu ). The ontology mapping should be relatively easy to accomplish as our CLKB structure was created in such a way that supports
      an effective and easy-to-understand downstream activities.

     4 DISCUSSION 
     
     We find many ways in which the cell line nomenclature could be made more useful to the community. These include formalizing
      non-standardized formatting of textual data, the use of special characters or too common English words as cell line name in
      research. A serious issue is inconsistent name of a cell line caused by cross-species contamination or propagation method.
     
     
     4.1 Cell line ontology 
     
     As a first step in developing the knowledgebase, we defined this cell line ontology. An ontology described and defined in
      one context may or may not be a consensus to all users. Depending on the perspective of the user, there may be multiple ‘correct’
      ontologies that capture the ontology's user needs. Because the primary purpose for this type of ontology is to rationalize
      the cell line nomenclature in experimental and clinical research, we have chosen to simplify the structure of the cell line
      ontology as described in the previous sections. This core cell line ontology structure can be extended in multiple ways.
     
     
     4.2 Cell line nomenclature 
     
     The compilation of this knowledgebase reveals a number of cell line names that can potentially be problematic ( Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Material ). First, there exist cell lines with identical cell line names, which are, however, distinct cell lines that should be listed
      separately. For example, the 15C6 cell line is used in more than one distinct ATCC catalog numbers, CRL-2431 and HB-326, one
      referring to a mouse hybridoma line and the other to a rat/mouse line ( Supplementary Table B for the complete list). Second, we have observed inconsistency in the use of cell line annotations between different laboratories
      when referring to the same cell line. For example, cell lines LLC-MK2, LLCMK2, LLCMK 2 , all appear to be the cell lines with identical attribute values. Other similar cases are of NIH/3T3 and NIH-3T3 cells, or
      BxPC3, BXPC-3, BxPC-3.

      Table 2. 
       Top 10 HyperCLDB cell line names that appear in non-biomedical corpus ranked by number of occurrences 
       
      
     
     
     Another source of inconsistencies is formatting of text. For example, capitalization, dashes, slashes and other punctuation
      marks are frequently used inconsistently between different public repositories or even within one repository if the cell line
      is obtained from different depositing laboratories. An NLP approach may be a suitable method to identify these occurrences.
      Table 1 gives some example of one cell line being described with different names. As it appears, many cell line records obtained
      from HyperCLDB contain different capitalization and punctuation even though they refer back to the same cell line in ATCC.
      The uncontrolled use of text formatting adds synonyms to the nomenclature and leads to more confusion. Symbols and Greek letters
      are another source of inconsistency. For example, Ψ may be shown as a Greek character in one instance and spelled out as ‘psi’
      in another. Unicode presents another issue. When annotating a cell line with Unicode characters (e.g. the use of α, γ, δ or
      ψ in some cases) different information systems may handle the data differently, in some cases even ignoring such characters
      altogether! Further, there are visually similar Unicode characters with distinct Unicode encodings. ‘Ψ’ and ‘ψ’ are both renderings
      of Psi in upper and lower case, but with distinct Unicode encoding. Although they may appear similar to the human eye, an
      automated script will fail to match them. Fourth, some cell line names cannot be recognized or distinguished easily when appearing
      in a different context or even in the same biomedical domain. For example, there exist cell line names that are too common
      to be easily tagged.
     
     
     Examples include HORSE, OK, WISH, 35 and 81.3. We have identified cell line names that are also common English words by constructing
      a dictionary of cell line names from HyperCLDB collection and searching against a moderate-size corpus of Wall Street Journal
      text that is unlikely to include references to cell lines. Table 2 shows the top 10 HyperCLDB cell line names that occur in a non-biomedical context. Furthermore, we have also investigated
      the use of cell line names in NCBI GEO microarray description fields. We parsed out 26 109 microarray sample descriptions
      and tagged the named entities of cell line names based on the HyperCLDB cell line name dictionary that we constructed in the
      Wall Street Journal corpus experiment as described previously. Some of the occurrences of cell line ‘35’ were false positive
      as one may have already expected. ‘Bm’ may as well be an acronym for bone marrow, and not a cell line name at all. Table 3 demonstrates the list of tagged cell line names in microarray sample descriptions.

      Table 3. 
       HyperCLDB cell line names that appear in NCBI GEO Microarray sample description, ranked by number of occurrences 
       
      
     
     
     Note that, only a few of the known cell line names appear in the sample description, and some are more frequently used than
      the others. This may be due to the fact that many GEO samples contain null description field, or very short phrases. Further
      investigation reveals that tissueOrCelllineName field in GEO sample attributes has been left blank (NULL) in the majority of the data deposited in GEO database. Some GEO
      samples have information of tissue of origin, and only a small part contain the cell line information. Furthermore, very few
      values in sampleNameInExperiment from the GEO sample attributes are useful pointers to cell line information of the sample used in that experiment. However,
      some GEO series descriptions contain information that a rule-based NLP implementation may be able to extract useful cell line
      information from them. A script implementing NLP was written to demonstrate that a simple rule-based NLP approach could help
      eliminate some common false hits and gain some information of cell line name in text scanning. We tagged cell line names that
      appeared in 8091 GEO sample descriptions, 1059 GEO series descriptions and 5 187 422 PubMed sentences containing the word
      ‘cell’ or ‘cells’ [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign sentence splitter (UIUC, 2004 ) was used to create this PubMed sentence table].
     
     
     Comparisons of the common names of cell line names in GEO sample descriptions, series description and PubMed sentences are
      given in Tables 4 5 6 . The complete tables are given in Supplementary Materials . The rule-based procedure tagged only cell line names (taken from the existing cell line name dictionary) that preceded ‘cell’,
      or ‘cells’ tokens, or followed ‘cell line’ token. Also, we used the spaced-tagging strategy (‘_% cells|cell_’) to avoid false
      hits in tagging short cell line names (two characters long or shorter). An obvious example in this case is a single-letter
      cell line name like ‘L cells’; a non-spaced tagging will result in false positives in phrases like ‘… small cells’, or ‘…
      epithelial cells’. The non-spaced tagging (‘% cells|cell’) was used for cell line names that are longer than 2 characters
      as cell line names can appear at the beginning of a sentence. Another important point regarding rule-based tagging concerns
      the use of textual qualifiers. There may be other qualifiers for such tagging that researchers use in free text. Further,
      authors sometimes drop the qualifiers and use only the cell line name token in other sections of a document. However, we have
      discovered from this experiment that, in the case of wildly used cell lines, authors seem to conform well to our rules/patterns
      of ‘cell’ or ‘cells’ token. HeLa cell line was used as an example. Our scripts recalled 22 431 documents that contained ‘HeLa’
      (and its spelling variants) tokens. In these documents, there are 43 255 sentences containing the word ‘HeLa’ and its variants.
      Out of these 43 255 sentences, 34 255 sentences are the sentences where the cell line tokens were tagged in the context of
      ‘% hela cell%’. Therefore, 79.19% of sentences tagged with the cell line token were correctly identified as true positives
      when using rule-based method. Furthermore, when we looked at documents that contained multiple sentences mentioning HeLa and
      compared with the documents in which only a single sentence was found tagged with HeLa, there are smaller number of documents
      in the multiple-sentence set (8558 documents) than the single-sentence set (10 026 documents). Among documents with multiple
      sentences that co-occur with ‘hela’, looking for an instance that matches the rule ‘% hela cell%’ in one sentence and then
      assuming that all instances of ‘hela’ in that document were references to an actual cell line that found additional 3196 sentences
      in 1215 documents (these 1215 documents are not a subset of the 8558 multiple-sentence documents). It should also be noted
      that while we gain better precision with this rule-based strategy, there is also a tradeoff in losing the overall recall.
      Even though this rule-based NLP approach remains effective in achieving high recall at larger scale text scanning, further
      study of finding an optimal adjustment may still be required for a smaller dataset.

     4.3 Discovery of uncataloged cell line names and synonyms 
     
     As there are often newly created cell lines in research laboratories, one may wish to utilize a set of existing cell line
      names for machine learning of biomedical terms using a similar approach to the construction of GENIA ontology (Liu et al. , 2006 ) to recognize novel cell line names that have not been submitted to a repository. This leads to a question that whether or
      not one can derive a contextual format in which a cell line name may occur. A BayesNet classifier model using Weka (Frank
      et al. , 2004 ) was introduced to this project in attempt to identify and discover the potentials token of novel cell line names in literature
      (here, we conducted our experiment with PubMed and NCBI GEO sample description sentences). One generalized observation is
      that tokens ‘cell’ or ‘cell line’ are often found in co-occurrence with an existing cell line name. The classifier could successfully
      identify the named entities to be of either cell-type or cell line classes based on the information from MeSH identifiers
      under A11 Tissue sub-tree, and the known cell line names in our dictionary. BayesNet classification turned out to be a powerful
      method to build this classifier. However, over-generalized names and the other natural language processing issues (as described
      previously) introduce a real obstacle for such discovery because they generate a large number of false matches in text scanning.
     
     
     We also took another approach to distinguish cell line names from other named entities in an attempt to identify novel cell
      line names. As standard nomenclature, we know that capitalization signifies differentiation between DNA name and protein name.
      We have also observed the cell line names in parentheses, as many cell line names are acronyms. For example, papers describing
      Chinese Hamster Ovary cell culture often have token ‘CHO’ in parentheses. Focusing on short tokens in parentheses, we can
      narrow down the search space of potential cell line named entities. Further, we could assume that a token containing only
      digits and uppercase letters may potentially be a novel cell line name. ‘293T’ token comes up when using this rule-based NLP
      named entity tagging [there is not a cell line named ‘293T’ in either ATCC catalog (the closest name is 293T/17), or in HyperCLDB
      listing (the closest name is 293)]. Out of 46 976 tokens found in the context of ‘% cell%’ ranked by number of occurrences,
      ‘293T’ comes up at 47th place with 2809 counts, 2797 occurrences with ‘293T’ spelling and 12 occurrences with ‘293t’ spelling.
      When checking with tokens that appear in parentheses, out of 51 216 tagged tokens ranked by frequency of occurrences, ‘293T’
      comes up at 174th place with 2811 counts, 2799 with ‘293T’ spelling and 12 with ‘293t’ spelling. As confirmed by experimental
      biologists, 293T is a bona fide cell line. Our ability to recognize this as a cell line name based on lexical context suggests
      a promising direction for further investigation of novel cell line name discovery in free text.
     
     
     4.4 Cross-contaminated cell lines 
     
     Cross-contamination is a very serious source of confusion in cell line nomenclature. Cell lines may be contaminated at many
      steps during propagation and the maintainer of that tissue culture may not be aware of such contamination. Misattribution
      of cross-contaminated cell lines causes extensive confusion about what a cell line truly is (examples given in Table 7 ). The widespread contamination with HeLa cells was first recognized by Walter Nelson-Rees using banded marker chromosomes
      as indicators of intra-species cellular contamination (Nelson-Rees et al. , 1974 ). Cross-contamination of cell cultures has been an ongoing issue since (Nelson-Rees, 2001 ). Despite 30 years of effort, cross-contamination remains a problem. A study of contamination in leukemia–lymphoma cell lines
      has also shown that ∼15% of these cell lines are not the true representation of what they actually are, or are assumed to
      be (Drexler et al. , 2002b , 2003 ).

      Table 7. 
       Examples of cross-contaminated cell lines 
       
      
     
     
     Moreover, even if a cell line is not contaminated, it may not be stable and its character may change from passage to passage.
      This may cause the birth of a ‘new’ cell line, sometimes without the knowledge of the users. DNA profiling and cytogenetic
      analysis are robust methods to identify different cell lines (Drexler et al. , 2002a ; MacLeod et al. , 1997 ). These assays are becoming less expensive, and we hope will become a standard practice.

     5 CONCLUSIONS 
     
     A recent study of dictionary-based named entity tagging of protein name (Liu et al. , 2006 ) reveals that, despite the standardized HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), issues of ambiguity remain in biomedical
      applications of automated NLP. Our study shows that there are many other categories of information in the biomedical domain
      where there is also a need to eliminate ambiguity wherever possible. This includes not only that the agreement on a standard
      nomenclature with unique and distinctive names would greatly facilitate text interpretation, but also the elimination of cross-contamination
      in cell lines. As a first step toward standardizing the nomenclature for cell lines, we present the results of this research
      in Supplementary Material—cell line token analysis. We also propose that a standard protocol of the minimal set of information
      including molecular characteristics of cell line should be complied at the development and at repository level as well.
     
     
     The mapping of cell line names to word tokens in GEO sample descriptions demonstrates that this ontology can be very useful
      in data quality assurance and control. One may wish to cross check, for example, whether or not the organism labeled for each
      GEO sample really matches with its corresponding organism in the cell line of that sample that was grown in. With the issues
      described here and how much automated NLP applications can potentially accomplish, one cannot stress enough the importance
      of standardization of biomedical terms. Furthermore, it is to our surprise to find that ever so often people do not cite where
      they obtain cell cultures in their research. Without an explicit explanation from the author, it is not practical to assume
      the source of cell cultures. The current lack of standardized nomenclature in many areas will be an obstacle to the development
      of effective natural language processing for the interpretation and analysis of free-text biomedical information.
     
     
     The issue of cross-contaminated cell lines remains serious and has been stressed with the NIH notice regarding authentication
      of cultured cell lines (NIH, 2007 ) and an open letter to the US Department of Health and Human Services regarding the issue of cell line cross-contamination
      (Nardone et al. , 2007 ).

The hierarchy of biological classification 's eight major taxonomic ranks . A genus contains one or more species. Intermediate minor rankings are not shown. 
 
 
 In biology , a species (plural: species) is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank . A species is often defined as a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. While in many cases this definition is adequate, the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem . Differing measures are often used, such as similarity of DNA, morphology or ecological niche. Presence of specific locally adapted traits may further subdivide species into " infraspecific taxa " such as subspecies (and in botany other taxa are used, such as varieties , subvarieties, and formae). 
 Species hypothesized to have the same ancestors are placed in one genus , based on similarities. The similarity of species is judged based on comparison of physical attributes, especially their DNA sequences, where available. All species are given a two-part name , a "binomial name". The first part of a binomial name is the generic name , the genus of the species. The second part is either called the specific name (a term used only in zoology) or the specific epithet (the term used in botany, which can also be used in zoology). For example, Boa constrictor is one of four species of the Boa genus. The first part of the name is capitalized, and the second part has a lower case. The binomial name is written in italics when printed and underlined when handwritten. 
 A usable definition of the word "species" and reliable methods of identifying particular species are essential for stating and testing biological theories and for measuring biodiversity , though other taxonomic levels such as families may be considered in broad-scale studies. [ 1 ] Extinct species known only from fossils are generally difficult to assign precise taxonomic rankings, which is why higher taxonomic levels such as families are often used for fossil-based studies. [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] 
 The total number of non-bacterial species in the world has been estimated at 8.7 million, [ 3 ]  [ 4 ] with previous estimates ranging from two million to 100 million. [ 5 ]

 [ edit ] Biologists' working definition 
 A usable definition of the word "species" and reliable methods of identifying particular species is essential for stating and testing biological theories and for measuring biodiversity . Traditionally, multiple examples of a proposed species must be studied for unifying characters before it can be regarded as a species. It is generally difficult to give precise taxonomic rankings to extinct species known only from fossils. 
 Some biologists may view species as statistical phenomena, as opposed to the traditional idea, with a species seen as a class of organisms. In that case, a species is defined as a separately evolving lineage that forms a single gene pool . Although properties such as DNA-sequences and morphology are used to help separate closely related lineages, [ 6 ] this definition has fuzzy boundaries. [ 7 ] However, the exact definition of the term "species" is still controversial, particularly in prokaryotes , [ 8 ] and this is called the species problem . [ 9 ] Biologists have proposed a range of more precise definitions, but the definition used is a pragmatic choice that depends on the particularities of the species of concern. [ 9 ] 
 [ edit ] Common names and species 
 The commonly used names for plant and animal taxa sometimes correspond to species: for example, " lion ", " walrus ", and " Camphor tree " – each refers to a species. In other cases common names do not: for example, " deer " refers to a family of 34 species, including Eld's Deer , Red Deer and Elk (Wapiti). The last two species were once considered a single species, illustrating how species boundaries may change with increased scientific knowledge. 
 [ edit ] Placement within genera 
 Ideally, a species is given a formal, scientific name, although in practice there are very many unnamed species (which have only been described, not named). When a species is named, it is placed within a genus . From a scientific point of view this can be regarded as a hypothesis that the species is more closely related to other species within its genus (if any) than to species of other genera. Species and genus are usually defined as part of a larger taxonomic hierarchy. The best-known taxonomic ranks are, in order: life , domain , kingdom , phylum , class , order , family , genus , and species. This assignment to a genus is not immutable; later a different (or the same) taxonomist may assign it to a different genus, in which case the name will also change. 
 In biological nomenclature, the name for a species is a two-part name (a binomial name ), treated as Latin , although roots from any language can be used as well as names of locales or individuals. The generic name is listed first (with its leading letter capitalized), followed by a second term. The terminology used for the second term differs between zoological and botanical nomenclature. 
 
 In zoological nomenclature, the second part of the name can be called the specific name or the specific epithet. For example, gray wolves belong to the species Canis lupus , coyotes to Canis latrans , golden jackals to Canis aureus , etc., and all of those belong to the genus Canis (which also contains many other species). For the gray wolf, the genus name is Canis , the specific name or specific epithet is lupus , and the binomen, the name of the species, is Canis lupus . 
 In botanical nomenclature, the second part of the name can only be called the specific epithet . The 'specific name' in botany is always the combination of genus name and specific epithet. For example, the species commonly known as the longleaf pine is Pinus palustris ; the genus name is Pinus , the specific epithet is palustris , the specific name is Pinus palustris . 
 
 This binomial naming convention, later formalized in the biological codes of nomenclature , was first used by Leonhart Fuchs and introduced as the standard by Carolus Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum (followed by his 1758 Systema Naturae , 10th edition). At that time, the chief biological theory was that species represented independent acts of creation by God and were therefore considered objectively real and immutable, so the hypothesis of common descent did not apply. 
 [ edit ] Abbreviated names 
 Books and articles sometimes intentionally do not identify species fully and use the abbreviation " sp. " in the singular or " spp. " in the plural in place of the specific epithet: for example, Canis sp. This commonly occurs in the following types of situations: 
 
 The authors are confident that some individuals belong to a particular genus but are not sure to which exact species they belong. This is particularly common in paleontology . 
 The authors use "spp." as a short way of saying that something applies to many species within a genus, but do not wish to say that it applies to all species within that genus. If scientists mean that something applies to all species within a genus, they use the genus name without the specific epithet. 
 
 In books and articles, genus and species names are usually printed in italics . Abbreviations such as "sp.", "spp.", "subsp.", etc. should not be italicized. 
 [ edit ] Identification codes 
 Various codes have been devised for identifying particular species. For example: 
 
 NCBI employs a numeric 'taxid' or Taxonomy identifier , a "stable unique identifier", e.g. the taxid of H. sapiens is 9606 [ 10 ] 
 KEGG employs a three-letter code for a limited number of organisms; in this code, for example, H. sapiens is simply hsa ; [ 11 ] 
 UniProt employs an "organism mnemonic" of not more than five alphanumeric characters, e.g. HUMAN for H. sapiens  [ 12 ]

The Greenish Warbler demonstrates the concept of a ring species . 
 
 
 It is surprisingly difficult to define the word "species" in a way that applies to all naturally occurring organisms, [ 13 ] and the debate among biologists about how to define "species" and how to identify actual species is called the species problem . Over two dozen distinct definitions of "species" are in use amongst biologists. [ 14 ] 
 Most textbooks follow Ernst Mayr's definition of a species as "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups". [ 9 ] 
 Various parts of this definition serve to exclude some unusual or artificial matings: 
 
 Those that occur only in captivity (when the animal's normal mating partners may not be available) or as a result of deliberate human action 
 Animals that may be physically and physiologically capable of mating but, for various reasons, do not normally do so in the wild 
 
 The typical textbook definition above works well for most multi-celled organisms , but there are several types of situations in which it breaks down: 
 
 By definition it applies only to organisms that reproduce sexually . So it does not work for asexually reproducing single-celled organisms and for the relatively few parthenogenetic or apomictic multi-celled organisms. The term " phylotype " is often applied to such organisms. 
 Biologists frequently do not know whether two morphologically similar groups of organisms are "potentially" capable of interbreeding. 
 There is considerable variation in the degree to which hybridization may succeed under natural conditions, or even in the degree to which some organisms use sexual reproduction between individuals to breed. 
 In ring species , members of adjacent populations interbreed successfully but members of some non-adjacent populations do not. 
 In a few cases it may be physically impossible for animals that are members of the same species to mate. However, these are cases, such as in breeds of dogs, in which human intervention has caused gross morphological changes, and are therefore excluded by the biological species concept. [ dubious – discuss ] 
 
 Horizontal gene transfer makes it even more difficult to define the word "species". There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between very dissimilar groups of prokaryotes , and at least occasionally between dissimilar groups of eukaryotes ; and Williamson [ 15 ] argues that there is evidence for it in some crustaceans and echinoderms . All definitions of the word "species" assume that an organism gets all its genes from one or two parents that are very like that organism, but horizontal gene transfer makes that assumption false. 
 [ edit ] Definitions of species 
 See also: Species problem 
 The question of how best to define "species" is one that has occupied biologists for centuries, and the debate itself has become known as the species problem . Darwin wrote in chapter II of On the Origin of Species : 
 
 No one definition has satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. [ 16 ] 
 
 But later, in The Descent of Man , when addressing "The question whether mankind consists of one or several species", Darwin revised his opinion to say: 
 
 it is a hopeless endeavour to decide this point on sound grounds, until some definition of the term "species" is generally accepted; and the definition must not include an element that cannot possibly be ascertained, such as an act of creation. [ 17 ] 
 
 The modern theory of evolution depends on a fundamental redefinition of "species". Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed species as ideal or general types, which could be exemplified by an ideal specimen bearing all the traits general to the species. Darwin's theories shifted attention from uniformity to variation and from the general to the particular. According to intellectual historian Louis Menand , 
 
 Once our attention is redirected to the individual, we need another way of making generalizations. We are no longer interested in the conformity of an individual to an ideal type; we are now interested in the relation of an individual to the other individuals with which it interacts. To generalize about groups of interacting individuals, we need to drop the language of types and essences, which is prescriptive (telling us what finches should be), and adopt the language of statistics and probability, which is predictive (telling us what the average finch, under specified conditions, is likely to do). Relations will be more important than categories; functions, which are variable, will be more important than purposes; transitions will be more important than boundaries; sequences will be more important than hierarchies. [ 18 ] 
 
 This shift results in a new approach to "species"; Darwin concluded that species are what they appear to be: ideas, which are provisionally useful for naming groups of interacting individuals. "I look at the term species", he wrote, "as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other ... It does not essentially differ from the word variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for convenience sake." [ 18 ] 
 Practically, biologists define species as populations of organisms that have a high level of genetic similarity . This may reflect an adaptation to the same niche, and the transfer of genetic material from one individual to others, through a variety of possible means. The exact level of similarity used in such a definition is arbitrary, but this is the most common definition used for organisms that reproduce asexually ( asexual reproduction ), such as some plants and microorganisms . 
 This lack of any clear species concept in microbiology has led to some authors arguing that the term "species" is not useful when studying bacterial evolution. Instead they see genes as moving freely between even distantly related bacteria, with the entire bacterial domain being a single gene pool. Nevertheless, a kind of rule of thumb has been established, saying that species of Bacteria or Archaea with 16S rRNA gene sequences more similar than 97% to each other need to be checked by DNA-DNA Hybridization if they belong to the same species or not. [ 19 ] This concept has been updated recently, saying that the border of 97% was too low and can be raised to 98.7%. [ 20 ] 
 In the study of sexually reproducing organisms, where genetic material is shared through the process of reproduction, the ability of two organisms to interbreed and produce fertile offspring of both sexes is generally accepted as a simple indicator that the organisms share enough genes to be considered members of the same species. Thus a "species" is a group of interbreeding organisms. 
 This definition can be extended to say that a species is a group of organisms that could potentially interbreed – fish could still be classed as the same species even if they live in different lakes, as long as they could still interbreed were they ever to come into contact with each other. On the other hand, there are many examples of series of three or more distinct populations, where individuals of the population in the middle can interbreed with the populations to either side, but individuals of the populations on either side cannot interbreed. Thus, one could argue that these populations constitute a single species, or two distinct species. This is not a paradox; it is evidence that species are defined by gene frequencies, and thus have fuzzy boundaries. 
 Consequently, any single, universal definition of "species" is necessarily arbitrary. Instead, biologists have proposed a range of definitions; which definition a biologists uses is a pragmatic choice, depending on the particularities of that biologist's research. 
 In practice, these definitions often coincide, and the differences between them are more a matter of emphasis than of outright contradiction. Nevertheless, no species concept yet proposed is entirely objective, or can be applied in all cases without resorting to judgment. Given the complexity of life, some have argued [ who? ] that such an objective definition is in all likelihood impossible, and biologists should settle for the most practical definition. 
 For most vertebrates , this is the biological species concept (BSC), and to a lesser extent (or for different purposes) the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). Many BSC subspecies are considered species under the PSC; the difference between the BSC and the PSC can be summed up insofar as that the BSC defines a species as a consequence of manifest evolutionary history , while the PSC defines a species as a consequence of manifest evolutionary potential . Thus, a PSC species is "made" as soon as an evolutionary lineage has started to separate, while a BSC species starts to exist only when the lineage separation is complete. Accordingly, there can be considerable conflict between alternative classifications based upon the PSC versus BSC, as they differ completely in their treatment of taxa that would be considered subspecies under the latter model (e.g., the numerous subspecies of honey bees ). 
 [ edit ] Typological species 
 A group of organisms in which individuals are members of the species if they sufficiently conform to certain fixed properties. The clusters of variations or phenotypes within specimens (i.e. longer or shorter tails) would differentiate the species. This method was used as a "classical" method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory. However, we now know that different phenotypes do not always constitute different species (e.g.: a 4-winged Drosophila born to a 2-winged mother is not a different species). Species named in this manner are called morphospecies or nominal species . [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] 
 [ edit ] Evolutionary species 
 A single evolutionary lineage of organisms within which genes can be shared, and that maintains its integrity with respect to other lineages through both time and space. At some point in the evolution of such a group, some members may diverge from the main population and evolve into a subspecies, a process that may eventually lead to the formation of a new species if isolation (geographical or ecological) is maintained. A species that gives rise to another species is a paraphyletic species, or paraspecies . [ 23 ] 
 [ edit ] Phylogenetic (cladistic) species 
 A group of organisms that shares an ancestor; a lineage that maintains its integrity with respect to other lineages through both time and space. At some point in the progress of such a group, members may diverge from one another: when such a divergence becomes sufficiently clear, the two populations are regarded as separate species. This differs from evolutionary species in that the parent species goes extinct taxonomically when a new species evolves, the mother and daughter populations now forming two new species. [ 24 ]  Subspecies as such are not recognized under this approach; either a population is a phylogenetic species or it is not taxonomically distinguishable. 
 [ edit ] Other 
 
 Ecological species 
 A set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment. According to this concept, populations form the discrete phenetic clusters that we recognize as species because the ecological and evolutionary processes controlling how resources are divided up tend to produce those clusters. [ 25 ] 
 
 
 Biological / reproductive species 
 Two organisms that are able to reproduce naturally to produce fertile offspring of both sexes. Organisms that can reproduce but almost always make infertile hybrids of at least one sex, such as a mule , hinny or F1 male cattalo are not considered to be the same species. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Biological / isolation species 
 A set of actually or potentially interbreeding populations. This is generally a useful formulation for scientists working with living examples of the higher taxa like mammals, fish, and birds, but more problematic for organisms that do not reproduce sexually. The results of breeding experiments done in artificial conditions may or may not reflect what would happen if the same organisms encountered each other in the wild, making it difficult to gauge whether or not the results of such experiments are meaningful in reference to natural populations. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Genetic species 
 Based on similarity of DNA of individuals or populations. Techniques to compare similarity of DNA include DNA-DNA hybridization , and genetic fingerprinting (or DNA barcoding ). [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Cohesion species 
 Most inclusive population of individuals having the potential for phenotypic cohesion through intrinsic cohesion mechanisms. This is an expansion of the mate-recognition species concept to allow for post-mating isolation mechanisms; no matter whether populations can hybridize successfully, they are still distinct cohesion species if the amount of hybridization is insufficient to completely mix their respective gene pools . [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) 
 An evolutionarily significant unit is a population of organisms that is considered distinct for purposes of conservation. Often referred to as a species or a wildlife species , an ESU also has several possible definitions, which coincide with definitions of species. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Phenetic species

 Microspecies 
 A species with very little genetic variability, usually one that reproduces by apomixis . 
 
 
 Recognition species 
 Based on shared reproductive systems, including mating behavior. The Recognition concept of species has been introduced by Hugh E. H. Paterson, after earlier work by Wilhelm Petersen . [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Mate-recognition species 
 A group of organisms that are known to recognize one another as potential mates. Like the isolation species concept above, it applies only to organisms that reproduce sexually.

 [ edit ] Numbers of species 
 
 
 
  
An estimate of the number of some undiscovered and discovered eukaryotic species. [ verification needed ] [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 Bearing in mind the aforementioned problems with categorizing species, the following numbers are only a guide. Based on various discussions from the first decade of the new millennium, counts can roughly be broken down as follows: [ 26 ] 
 Number of prokaryotic species, Domain Bacteria 
 
 This number is very difficult to assess, but the discussed range varies from tens of thousands to billions; [ 27 ]  [ 28 ]  [ 29 ]  [ 30 ]  [ 31 ] most recent approaches and studies appear to favor the larger magnitude number. [ 29 ]  [ 32 ]  [ 33 ] Smaller numbers arise from assumptions based on a plateauing of identification of new species (which has technical explanations other than that fewer species remain to be identified). [ 27 ] Larger numbers address the fact that success in culturing bacteria has only been achieved in half of identified Bacterial phyla (where lack of success in attempts to culture a bacterial isolate limits abilities to study and delineate new species), [ 30 ]  [ 34 ] and address the difficulty of applying traditional botanic and zoologic definitions of species to asexually reproducing bacteria (where more modern sequencing and molecular approaches support higher species tallies). [ 30 ]  [ 35 ] 
 
 Number of prokaryotic species, Domain Archaea 
 
 As a further microbial Domain, the issues and difficulties of Domain Bacteria also pertain to any counting of species of Archaea , all the more given their various extreme habitats . As the Wikipedia article on the Archaebacteria notes (Classification, Species section), the "classification of archaea into species is also controversial" as they also reproduce asexually (likewise eliminating applicability of species definitions based on interbreeding), and face the same difficulties associated with organism isolation and culturing (see citations for Bacteria, above). [ 34 ]  [ 35 ]  [ 36 ] Archaebacteria have been shown to exhibit high rates of horizontal gene transfer (resulting from a bacterial cognate of sex), including between organisms quite separate based on genomic analysis. [ 37 ] As the Archaea article notes, "[c]urrent knowledge on genetic diversity is fragmentary and the total number of archaean species cannot be estimated with any accuracy" ... though like Domain Bacteria, the number of cultured and studied phyla relative to the total is low (as of 2005, less than 50% of known phyla cultured). [ 38 ] Taken together, very high numbers of unique archaebacterial types are likely, as in the case of Domain Bacteria. 
 
 Number of eukaryotic species 
 This number has historically varied from a few million to about 100 millions. However these higher numbers, which were based on the potential deep marine and arthropod diversity, are now considered unlikely. The total number of eukaryotic species is likely to be 5 ± 3 million of which about 1.5 million have been already named. [ 39 ] 
 Some older estimates for various eukaryote phyla are (including some updated numbers): 
 
 As many as 1.5 million fungi ; [ 40 ] 
 3,067 brown algae 
 17,000 lichens ; 
 321,212 plants , including:
 
 10,134 red and green algae 
 16,236 mosses , 
 12,000 ferns and horsetails , 
 1,021 gymnosperms , 
 281,821 angiosperms ; 
 
 
 1,367,555 non-insect animals , including:
 
 1,305,250 invertebrates 
 
 2,175 corals 
 85,000 mollusks 
 As many as 1.1 million arachnids , including ~1 million mites [ 41 ] and ~100,000 other arachnids 
 47,000 crustaceans 
 68,827 other invertebrates; 
 
 
 63,649 vertebrates 
 
 31,300 fish , 
 7,093 amphibians , [ 42 ] 
 9,768 reptiles , [ 43 ] 
 9,998 birds , 
 5,490 mammals ; 
 
 
 
 
 As many as 10–30 million insects ; [ 44 ] 
 
 At present, organisations such as the Global Taxonomy Initiative , the European Distributed Institute of Taxonomy and the Census of Marine Life [ 45 ] (the latter only for marine organisms) are trying to improve taxonomy and implement previously undiscovered species to the taxonomy system, although current knowledge covers only a portion of the organisms in the biosphere and thus does not enable a complete understanding of the workings of the environment. Humankind is also currently wiping out undiscovered species at an unprecedented rate, [ 46 ] which means that even before a new species has had the chance of being studied and classified, it may already be extinct. 
 [ edit ] Importance in biological classification 
 The idea of species has a long history. It is one of the most important levels of classification, for several reasons: 
 
 It often corresponds to what lay people treat as the different basic kinds of organism – dogs are one species, cats another. 
 It is the standard binomial nomenclature (or trinomial nomenclature ) by which scientists typically refer to organisms. 
 It is the highest taxonomic level that cannot be made more or less inclusionary. 
 
 After years of use, the concept remains central to biology and a host of related fields, and yet also remains at times ill-defined. 
 [ edit ] Implications of assignment of species status 
 The naming of a particular species may be regarded as a hypothesis about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are discovered to be of the same species, the older species name is usually retained, and the newer species name dropped, a process called synonymization , or colloquially, as lumping . Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxons is called splitting . Taxonomists are often referred to as "lumpers" or "splitters" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognizing differences or commonalities between organisms (see lumpers and splitters ). 
 Traditionally, researchers relied on observations of anatomical differences, and on observations of whether different populations were able to interbreed successfully, to distinguish species; both anatomy and breeding behavior are still important to assigning species status. As a result of the revolutionary (and still ongoing) advance in microbiological research techniques, including DNA analysis, in the last few decades, a great deal of additional knowledge about the differences and similarities between species has become available. Many populations formerly regarded as separate species are now considered a single taxon , and many formerly grouped populations have been split. Any taxonomic level (species, genus, family, etc.) can be synonymized or split, and at higher taxonomic levels, these revisions have been still more profound. 
 From a taxonomical point of view, groups within a species can be defined as being of a taxon hierarchically lower than a species. In zoology only the subspecies is used, while in botany the variety , subvariety , and form are used as well. In conservation biology , the concept of evolutionary significant units (ESU) is used, which may define either species or smaller distinct population segments. Identifying and naming species is the providence of alpha taxonomy .

Linnaeus believed in the fixity of species. 
 
 
 In the earliest works of science, a species was simply an individual organism that represented a group of similar or nearly identical organisms. No other relationships beyond that group were implied. Aristotle used the words genus and species to mean generic and specific categories. Aristotle and other pre-Darwinian scientists took the species to be distinct and unchanging, with an " essence ", like the chemical elements . When early observers began to develop systems of organization for living things, they began to place formerly isolated species into a context. Many of these early delineation schemes would now be considered whimsical and these included consanguinity based on color (all plants with yellow flowers) or behavior (snakes, scorpions and certain biting ants). 
 John Ray (1686), an English naturalist, was the first to give a biological definition of the term species. [ 47 ] 
 In the 18th century Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to differences in the form of reproductive apparatus . Although his system of classification sorts organisms according to degrees of similarity, it made no claims about the relationship between similar species. At that time, it was still widely believed that there was no organic connection between species, no matter how similar they appeared. This approach also suggested a type of idealism: the notion that each species existed as an "ideal form". Although there are always differences (although sometimes minute) between individual organisms, Linnaeus considered such variation problematic. He strove to identify individual organisms that were exemplary of the species, and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be deviant and imperfect. 
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that species could change form over time, and that the history of the planet provided enough time for major changes. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck , in his 1809 Zoological Philosophy , offered one of the first logical arguments against creationism . The new emphasis was on determining how a species could change over time. Lamarck suggested that an organism could pass on an acquired trait to its offspring, i.e., the giraffe 's long neck was attributed to generations of giraffes stretching to reach the leaves of higher treetops (this well-known and simplistic example, however, does not do justice to the breadth and subtlety of Lamarck's ideas). With the acceptance of the natural selection idea of Charles Darwin in the 1860s, however, Lamarck's view of goal-oriented evolution, also known as a teleological process, was eclipsed. Recent interest in inheritance of acquired characteristics centers around epigenetic processes, e.g. methylation , that do not affect DNA sequences, but instead alter expression in an inheritable manner. Thus, Neo-Lamarckism , as it is sometimes termed, is not a challenge to the theory of evolution by natural selection. 
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace provided what scientists now consider as the most powerful and compelling theory of evolution . Darwin argued that it was populations that evolved, not individuals. His argument relied on a radical shift in perspective from that of Linnaeus: rather than defining species in ideal terms (and searching for an ideal representative and rejecting deviations), Darwin considered variation among individuals to be natural. He further argued that variation, far from being problematic, actually provides the explanation for the existence of distinct species. 
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus ' insight that the rate of growth of a biological population will always outpace the rate of growth of the resources in the environment, such as the food supply. As a result, Darwin argued, not all the members of a population will be able to survive and reproduce. Those that did will, on average, be the ones possessing variations—however slight—that make them slightly better adapted to the environment. If these variable traits are heritable, then the offspring of the survivors will also possess them. Thus, over many generations, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population, while counter-adaptive traits will tend to be eliminated. 
 Whether a variation is adaptive or non-adaptive depends on the environment: different environments favor different traits. Since the environment effectively selects which organisms live to reproduce, it is the environment (the "fight for existence") that selects the traits to be passed on. This is the theory of evolution by natural selection . In this model, the length of a giraffe's neck would be explained by positing that proto-giraffes with longer necks would have had a significant reproductive advantage to those with shorter necks. Over many generations, the entire population would be a species of long-necked animals. 
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, the mechanism behind the inheritance of individual traits was unknown. Although Darwin made some speculations on how traits are inherited ( pangenesis ), his theory relies only on the fact that inheritable traits exist , and are variable (which makes his accomplishment even more remarkable.) Although Gregor Mendel 's paper on genetics was published in 1866, its significance was not recognized. It was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Vries , Carl Correns and Erich von Tschermak , who realised that the "inheritable traits" in Darwin's theory are genes . 
 The theory of the evolution of species through natural selection has two important implications for discussions of species—consequences that fundamentally challenge the assumptions behind Linnaeus' taxonomy . First, it suggests that species are not just similar, they may actually be related. Some students of Darwin argue that all species are descended from a common ancestor. Second, it supposes that "species" are not homogeneous, fixed, permanent things; members of a species are all different, and over time species change. This suggests that species do not have any clear boundaries but are rather momentary statistical effects of constantly changing gene-frequencies. One may still use Linnaeus' taxonomy to identify individual plants and animals, but one can no longer think of species as independent and immutable. 
 The rise of a new species from a parental line is called speciation . There is no clear line demarcating the ancestral species from the descendant species. 
 Although the current scientific understanding of species suggests that there is no rigorous and comprehensive way to distinguish between different species in all cases, biologists continue to seek concrete ways to operationalize the idea. One of the most popular biological definitions of species is in terms of reproductive isolation; if two creatures cannot reproduce to produce fertile offspring of both sexes, then they are in different species. This definition captures a number of intuitive species boundaries, but it remains imperfect. It has nothing to say about species that reproduce asexually, for example, and it is very difficult to apply to extinct species. Moreover, boundaries between species are often fuzzy: there are examples where members of one population can produce fertile offspring of both sexes with a second population, and members of the second population can produce fertile offspring of both sexes with members of a third population, but members of the first and third population cannot produce fertile offspring, or can only produce fertile offspring of the homozygous sex. Consequently, some people reject this definition of a species. 
 Richard Dawkins defines two organisms as conspecific if and only if they have the same number of chromosomes and, for each chromosome, both organisms have the same number of nucleotides ( The Blind Watchmaker , p.&#160;118). However, most if not all taxonomists would strongly disagree [ citation needed ] . For example, in many amphibians , most notably in New Zealand's Leiopelma frogs, the genome consists of "core" chromosomes that are mostly invariable and accessory chromosomes, of which exist a number of possible combinations. Even though the chromosome numbers are highly variable between populations, these can interbreed successfully and form a single evolutionary unit. In plants, polyploidy is extremely commonplace with few restrictions on interbreeding; as individuals with an odd number of chromosome sets are usually sterile, depending on the actual number of chromosome sets present, this results in the odd situation where some individuals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with certain others and some cannot, with all populations being eventually linked as to form a common gene pool. 
 The classification of species has been profoundly affected by technological advances that have allowed researchers to determine relatedness based on molecular markers, starting with the comparatively crude blood plasma precipitation assays in the mid-20th century to Charles Sibley 's ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization studies in the 1970s leading to DNA sequencing techniques. The results of these techniques caused revolutionary changes in the higher taxonomic categories (such as phyla and classes ), resulting in the reordering of many branches of the phylogenetic tree ( see also: molecular phylogeny ). For taxonomic categories below genera , the results have been mixed so far; the pace of evolutionary change on the molecular level is rather slow, yielding clear differences only after considerable periods of reproductive separation. DNA-DNA hybridization results have led to misleading conclusions, the Pomarine Skua – Great Skua phenomenon being a famous example. Turtles have been determined to evolve with just one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles on the molecular level, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatrosses is half of what is found in the rather closely related storm-petrels . The hybridization technique is now obsolete and is replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparison. Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on the evolutionary processes, but rather on the overall change brought upon by these processes. The processes that lead to the generation and maintenance of variation such as mutation, crossover and selection are not uniform (see also molecular clock ). DNA is only extremely rarely a direct target of natural selection rather than changes in the DNA sequence enduring over generations being a result of the latter; for example, silent transition - transversion combinations would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded proteins and thus are a possible example where, for example in microorganisms, a mutation confers a change in fitness all by itself.
