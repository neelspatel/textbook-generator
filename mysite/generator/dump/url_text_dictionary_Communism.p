[ 1 ] It consists of democratic socialist, social democratic and labour political parties and other organisations. \n Although formed in 1951 as a successor to the Labour and Socialist International it has antecedents to the late 19th Century. Initially dominated by parties from Western Europe , it has grown to include more than 160 member parties from more than 100 countries. Its members have governed in many countries including most of Europe. The Party of European Socialists , a European political party is an associated organisation of the SI, as is its European parliamentary group , the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats . \n The current secretary-general of the SI is Luis Ayala (Chile), who has held the post since 1989. [ 3 ] The current president of the SI is the former Prime Minister of Greece George Papandreou .

[ 5 ] It was formed in London on 28 September 1864 by socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and trade unions. [ 6 ] Tensions between moderates and revolutionaries led to its dissolution in 1876 in Philadelphia . [ 7 ] The Second International was formed in Paris on 14 July 1889 as an association of the socialist parties. [ 8 ] Differences over World War I led to the Second International being dissolved in 1916. \n International Socialist Commission (ISC, also known as Berne International) was formed in February 1919 at a meeting in Berne by parties that wanted to resurrect the Second International. [ 9 ] In March 1919 communist parties formed Comintern (the Third International) at a meeting in Moscow . [ 10 ] Parties which did not want to be a part of the resurrected Second International (ISC) or Comintern formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (IWUSP, also known as Vienna International/Vienna Union/Two-and-a-Half International) on 27 February 1921 at a conference in Vienna . [ 11 ] The ISC and the IWUSP joined to form the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in May 1923 at a meeting in Hamburg . [ 12 ] The rise of Nazism and the start of World War II led to the dissolution of the LSI in 1940. The Socialist International was formed in Frankfurt in July 1951 as a successor to the LSI. [ 13 ] \n During the post-World War II period, the SI aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in Portugal (1974) and Spain (1975) . Until its 1976 Geneva Congress, the SI had few members outside Europe and no formal involvement with Latin America . [ 14 ] In the 1980s, most SI parties gave their backing to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas (FSLN), whose left-wing government had incited enmity from the United States . \n In the late 1970s and in the 1980s the SI had extensive contacts and discussion with the two leading powers of the Cold War period, the United States and the Soviet Union , on issues concerning East-West relations and arms control. The SI supported d\xc3\xa9tente and disarmament agreements, such as SALT II, START and INF . They had several meetings and discussion in Washington, D.C. with President Jimmy Carter and Vice-President George Bush and in Moscow with Secretaries General Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev . The SI\'s delegations to these discussions were led by the Finnish Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa . [ 15 ] \n Since then, the SI has admitted as member parties not only the FSLN but also the left-wing Puerto Rican Independence Party , as well as former Communist parties such as the Democratic Party of the Left of Italy and the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO). \n Following the Tunisian revolution , the Constitutional Democratic Rally was expelled from the SI in January 2011. [ 16 ] Later that month, the Egyptian National Democratic Party was also expelled. [ 17 ] As a result of the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 Ivorian crisis , the Ivorian Popular Front was expelled in March 2011. [ 18 ] However, according to section 5.1.3 of the statutes of the Socialist International, an expulsion requires a decision of Congress by a majority of two-thirds.

It has also usually been equated to the Comintern (Communist International). This is the meaning that typically and historically has been meant by opponents of communism . World communism is closely related and connected to stateless communism . \n Marxist theory may treat world communism as utopian, but it is the transition to world communism that attracts attention. World communism is to be achieved by world revolution , according to a theory that was popular in the period 1917 to around 1933 (at least). World communism is incompatible with the existence of nation-states , so according to an older theory there will be an abolition of the state preceding world communism. \n Abolition of the state is not incompatible with world revolution, but is not in itself a distinctively Marxist doctrine. It was held by various socialist and anarchist thinkers of the nineteenth century. An apparent alternative is a theory going back to Karl Marx , speaking of the " withering away of the state ". \n The crux here is a text of the Friedrich Engels , from his Anti-D\xc3\xbchring . It is often cited as "The state is not \'abolished,\' it withers away.\xe2\x80\x9d This is from the pioneer work of historical materialism , a formulation of Marx\'s idea of a materialist conception of history . The withering away of the state is a graphic formulation, that has passed into clich\xc3\xa9. The translation (Engels was writing in German) is also given as: "The state is not \'abolished\'. It dies out." [ 1 ] Reference to the whole passage shows that this happens only after the proletariat has seized the means of production. There has been a revolution. \n The schematic is therefore revolution, transitional period, utopian period. \n For Lenin the transitional period, which for Engels was reduced to a single act, has become extended and "obviously lengthy". [ 2 ] In the same place he argues strongly that Marx\'s conception of communist society is not utopian, but takes into account the heritage of what came before. \n This gives, at least roughly, the position on world communism as the Comintern was set up in 1919: world revolution is necessary for the setting up of world communism, but not immediately or clearly sufficient. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Proletarian internationalism \n Workers of the world, unite! \n \n [ edit ] Notes \n \n \n ^  [1] , taken from the Emile Burns translation of the 1894 German third edition, Part III section 2.

In this definition, socialism is defined as a mode of production where the criterion for production is use-value , where production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning and the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Socialism would be based on the principle of To each according to his contribution . The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working-class effectively controlling and owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood either through cooperative enterprises or public ownership and self management , so that the social surplus would accrue to the working class or society as a whole. [ 1 ] \n This view is consistent with, and helped to inform, early conceptions of socialism where the law of value no longer directs economic activity, and thus monetary relations in the form of exchange-value , profit , interest and wage labor would not operate and apply to socialism. [ 2 ] \n The Marxian conception of socialism stood in contrast to other early conceptions of socialism, most notably early forms of market socialism based on classical economics including Mutualism and Ricardian socialism , which unlike the Marxian conception, retained commodity exchange and markets for labor and the means of production. [ 3 ] The Marxian conception was also heavily opposed to Utopian socialism . \n Although Karl Marx and Fredrick Engels wrote very little on socialism and neglected to provide any details on how it might be organized, [ 4 ] numerous Marxists and neoclassical economists used Marx\'s theory as a basis for developing their own models and proposals for socialist economic systems and served as a point of reference for the socialist calculation debate . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Mode of production \n \n 1.1 Intermediate phases \n \n \n 2 Social relations \n \n 2.1 Role of the state \n \n \n 3 See also \n 4 Notes \n \n \n \n \n Mode of production \n Socialism is a post- commodity economic system, meaning that production is carried out to directly produce use-value (to directly satisfy human needs, or economic demands) as opposed to being produced with a view to generating a profit. The stage in which the accumulation of capital was viable and effective is rendered insufficient at the socialist stage of social and economic development, leading to a situation where production is carried out independently of capital accumulation in a supposedly planned fashion. Although Karl Marx and Frederich Engels understood planning to involve the input and decisions of the individuals involved at localized levels of production and consumption, planning has been interpreted to mean centralized planning by Marxist-Leninists during the 20th century. However, there have been other conceptions of economic planning, including decentralized-planning and participatory planning . \n In contrast to capitalism, which relies upon the coercive market forces to compel capitalists to produce use-values as a byproduct of the pursuit of profit, socialist production is to be based on the rational planning of use-values and coordinated investment decisions to attain economic goals. [ 5 ] As a result, the cyclical fluctuations that occur in a capitalist market economy will not be present in a socialist economy. The value of a good in socialism is its physical utility rather than its embodied labor, cost of production and exchange value as in a capitalist system. \n Socialism would make use of incentive-based systems, and inequality would still exist but to a diminishing extent as all members of society would be worker-owners. This eliminates the severity of previous tendencies towards inequality and conflicts arising ownership of the means of production and property income accruing to a small class of owners. [ 6 ] The method of compensation and reward in a socialist society would be based on an authentic meritocracy, along the principle of " from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution ". [ 7 ] \n The advanced stage of socialism, referred to as " upper-stage communism " in the Critique of the Gotha Programme , is based on the socialist mode of production but is differentiated from lower-stage socialism in a few fundamental ways. While socialism implies public ownership (by a state apparatus) or cooperative ownership (by a worker cooperative enterprise), communism would be based on common ownership of the means of production. Class distinctions based on ownership of capital cease to exist, along with the need for a state. A superabundance of goods and services are made possible by automated production that allow for goods to be distributed based on need rather than merit. [ 8 ] \n Intermediate phases \n The period in which capitalism becomes increasingly insufficient as an economic system and immediately after the proletarian conquest of the state , an economic system that features elements of both socialism and capitalism will probably exist until both the productive forces of the economy and the cultural and social attitudes develop to a point where they satisfy the requirements for a full socialist society (one that has lost the need for monetary value, wage labor and capital accumulation). Specifically, market relations will still exist but economic units are either nationalized or re-organized into cooperatives . This transitional phase is sometimes described as " state capitalism " or " market socialism ". \n Social relations \n The fundamental goal of socialism from the view of Marx and Engels was the realization of human freedom and individual autonomy. Specifically, this refers to freedom from the alienation imposed upon individuals in the form of coercive social relationships as well as material scarcity, whereby the individual is compelled to engage in activities merely to survive (to reproduce his or herself). The aim of socialism is to provide an environment whereby individuals are free to express their genuine interests, creative freedom, and desires unhindered by forms of social control that force individuals to work for a class of owners who expropriate and live off the surplus product . [ 9 ] \n As a set of social relationships, socialism is defined by the degree to which economic activity in society is planned by the associated producers, so that the surplus product produced by socialized assets is controlled by a majority of the population through democratic processes. The sale of labor power would be abolished so that every individual participates in running their institution as stakeholders or members with no one having coercive power over anyone else in a vertical social division of labor (which is to be distinguished from a non-social, technical division of labor which would still exist in socialism). [ 10 ] The incentive structure changes in a socialist society given the change in the social environment, so that an individual laborers\' work becomes increasingly autonomous and creative, creating a sense of responsibility for his or her institution as a stakeholder. The individual is no longer alienated from his or her work: work becomes a means by which the individual fulfills his or her humanity (pursues his or her interests). \n Role of the state \n In Marxist theory, the state is "the institution of organised violence which is used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. Thus, it is only in a society which is divided between hostile social classes that the state exists." [ 11 ] The state is thus seen as a mechanism that is dominated by the interests of the ruling class and utilized to subjugate other classes in order to protect and legitimize the existing economic system. \n After a workers\' revolution, the state would initially become the instrument of the working class. Conquest of the state apparatus by the working class must take place to establish a socialist system. As socialism is built, the role and scope of the state changes as class distinctions (based on ownership of the means of production) gradually deteriorate due to the concentration of means of production in state hands. From the point where all means of production become state property, the nature and primary function of the state would change from one of political rule (via coercion) over men by the creation and enforcement of laws into a scientific administration of things and a direction of processes of production; that is the state would become a coordinating economic entity rather than a mechanism of class or political control, and would no longer be a state in the Marxian sense.

"According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories - such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent - and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money." &#160; \n ^  McNally, David (1993).

"Marx and Engels never speculated on the detailed organization of a future socialist or communist society. The key task for them was building a movement to overthrow capitalism.

There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology...It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality." \n ^  SCARLETT.

Planning here is understood as the conscious regulation of society by the associated producers themselves.

The idea that a proletarian revolution is needed is a cornerstone of Marxism ; Marxists believe that the workers of the world must unite and free themselves from capitalist oppression to create a world run by and for the working class . Thus, in the Marxist view, proletarian revolutions need to happen in countries all over the world; see world revolution . \n Leninism argues that a communist revolution must be led by a vanguard of \' professional revolutionaries \'\xe2\x80\x94that is, men and women who are fully dedicated to the communist cause and who can then form the nucleus of the revolutionary movement. Some Marxists disagree with the idea of a vanguard as put forth by Lenin, especially left communists but also including some who continue to consider themselves Marxist-Leninists despite such a disagreement. These critics insist that the entire working class - or at least a large part of it - must be deeply involved and equally committed to the socialist or communist cause in order for a proletarian revolution to be successful. To this end, they seek to build massive communist parties with very large memberships. \n See the articles on communism and communist states for further discussion regarding the goals and results of some of these revolutions. \n [ edit ] Communist revolutions throughout history \n The following is a list of communist revolutions throughout history . The most significant ones are marked in bold . Among the lesser known revolutions, a number of borderline cases have been included which may or may not have been communist revolutions. The nature of unsuccessful revolutions is particularly contentious since one can only speculate as to the kinds of policies that would have been implemented by the revolutionaries had they achieved victory. \n \n The creation of the short-lived Paris Commune in 1871, which was crushed within months by the French Army . \n The 1917 communist revolution in Russia , known as the October Revolution and a part of the Russian Revolution . It resulted in the victory of the Bolsheviks and the creation of Soviet Russia , the predecessor of the Soviet Union . \n The German Revolution of 1918-1919, led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht , which ended in defeat for the communists. \n The creation of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919, which was defeated within a month by the German army and Freikorps . \n The creation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919, led by B\xc3\xa9la Kun , which was defeated after five months. \n The Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921 led by the Mongolian People\'s Revolutionary Party , which defeated the Republic of China\'s Mongolian Puppet state and the White Guards under Baron Ungern with the help of the Russian Red Army . \n The 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising , known as La matanza (the slaughter), Pipil and peasant rebellion led by Farabundo Mart\xc3\xad . \n The Chinese Revolution , final stage of the Chinese Civil War (1926\xe2\x80\x931949), that resulted in the victory of the Communist Party of China in China in 1949. \n 1941-1945 People\'s Liberation War in Yugoslavia is waged by the Yugoslav Partisans under the command of Josip Broz Tito with Allied support against the invading forces of Nazi Germany and the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustase . The victorious partisans establish the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . \n The August Revolution 1945 creating the Democratic Republic of Vietnam . \n The Proclamation of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea in 1948, when the Soviet-backed Workers Party of Korea , led by Kim Il-sung , announced the formation of the state of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea. \n The Cuban Revolution of 1959 was a nationalistic revolution led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara which overthrew former president Fulgencio Batista and instated a socialist regime later on in Cuba . Even though Batista had been elected for his first term, he got himself into power for his second term through a coup d\'etat . \n Les Trois Glorieuses of 1963 in Congo-Brazzaville , a successful coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat led by the Conf\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration g\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale a\xc3\xa9fienne du travail and the Union de la jeunesse congolaise against Fulbert Youlou established the People\'s Republic of the Congo . \n The Communist Party of Indonesia \'s support for President Sukarno , which ended when Indonesian General Suharto removed President Sukarno from power and defeated the Communist Party of Indonesia, in 1965-1966. \n The First Indochina War that resulted in the defeat of the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu , 1954, and brought the Communist Party of Vietnam under Ho Chi Minh to power in North Vietnam &#160;\xe2\x80\x93 a victory followed closely by the protracted guerrilla warfare -dominated Vietnam War (1957\xe2\x80\x931975), which in turn led to the Fall of Saigon and the driving-out of occupying U.S. military forces there, and the unification of North and South Vietnam by communist guerrilla forces into the Socialist Republic of Vietnam . The conflict drastically changed neighboring Laos and Cambodia . \n The Laotian Civil War resulting in the victory of the communist Pathet Lao / Lao People\'s Revolutionary Party in Laos by 1975, eliminating a coalition government with anti-communists led to the establishment of the communist-administered Lao People\'s Democratic Republic . \n The victory of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in 1975, establishing the agrarian socialist regime known as " Democratic Kampuchea ," with Pol Pot as dictator . In 1979 it was overthrown by former allies: socialist neighbor Vietnam and another communist party faction, reconstituted as the Kampuchean People\'s Revolutionary Party and establishing the People\'s Republic of Kampuchea . \n The Malayan Emergency when the Malayan Communist Party and communist guerrillas fought against, and were defeated by, British and Malayan forces, 1948-1960. \n Maoist -styled " Protracted People\'s War " in the Philippines , launched by the New People\'s Army in 1969 and continuing at present \n The overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie by Mengistu Haile Mariam who then set up one-party Marxist-Leninist rule in Ethiopia by the communist Workers\' Party of Ethiopia , 1977\xe2\x80\x931991, until they were defeated and expelled by the Ethiopian People\'s Revolutionary Democratic Front during a subsequent civil war. \n The 1978 the Saur Revolution that brought the People\'s Democratic Party of Afghanistan to power in Afghanistan . They were overthrown by the mujahedin in 1992. [ 1 ] \n The overthrow of Eric Gairy that brought the New Jewel Movement to power in Grenada from 1979 until 1983, when they were deposed by a U.S. -led invasion. \n The 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution that overthrew the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle and brought the Sandinistas to power in Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990. \n The Salvadoran Civil War , (1980\xe2\x80\x931992) FMLN (mainly composed of Marxist-Leninist guerrilla groups) fought against the U.S. backed military government which suppressed the rebel movement by framing and mass murdering alleged Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries ( El Mozote massacre ). The FMLN was inspired by the ideologies of Farabundo Mart\xc3\xad and Vladimir Lenin . \n Internal conflict in Peru (1980\xe2\x80\x93present) Comprised two rebellions by two different Marxist organizations. One of several groups that calls itself the Communist Party of Peru , the Shining Path fought a bloody war beginning in 1980 with successive Peruvian governments, both democratic and authoritarian in nature, and independent paramilitaries organized by the government known as Ronda Campesina . The Shining Path attempted to enforce a particular brand of communism inspired by the beliefs of Mao Zedong , the leader of the People\'s Republic of China from 1949-1976. The Shining Path opposed any form of democracy and committed numerous human rights violations. Another organization, known as the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), named after an Incan warrior Tupac Amaru began their own rebellion in 1982. The MRTA did not adhere to Maoism like the Shining Path, claimed to be fighting for democracy, believed in a more mainstream version of communism and modeled their movement on other left-wing guerrilla groups in Latin America. The MRTA and Shining Path quickly became bitter enemies and fought one another as well as the government of Peru. During the war atrocities were committed on all sides, but mostly by the Shining Path and the Peruvian military. Fighting goes on today with a small number of Shining Path cadres, however the movement has mostly been crushed and only operates in a very remote jungle region. Since the capture of Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman , the organization has lost most of its earlier support. The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement was largely destroyed in 1997 after the Japanese embassy hostage crisis . \n From 1996-2006, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) fought a fairly successful revolutionary war against the autocratic King of Nepal . In 2006 peace was declared, and an agreement was reached that the Maoists would join an interim government. \n In India , various Maoist-oriented factions (generally called Naxalites ) have waged armed struggles since the Naxalbari rebellion of 1967 .

It lost its dominance in the wake of the failure of the 1991 August putsch . \n The Communist Party of the Soviet Union emerged from the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party , under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin . After the February Revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks pushed for socialist revolution and the overthrow of the Provisional Government . On 7 November, the Bolsheviks orchestrated the October Revolution which overthrew the Provisional Government, thus transferring all governing power to the workers\' councils ( Russian : soviets ). Immediately thereafter, the Bolsheviks founded the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic - the world\'s first constitutionally socialist state . After a bloody civil war , at the end of 1922 the Bolsheviks emerged victorious and unified territories of the former Russian Empire into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). \n The Party established the Third International, known as " Comintern " (" Communist International "), an international network of communist parties loyal to the Russian Communist Party, with the aim of fighting "by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State." [ 1 ] Domestically, given the central role under the Constitution of the Soviet Union , the Party controlled all tiers of government and social institutions in the Soviet Union. Its organisation was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent Soviet republics as well as the mass youth organisation, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League ( Komsomol ) and the Young Pioneer organisation for children. \n After Lenin\'s death in 1924, an ideological struggle ensued within the Party between Leon Trotsky , who advocated permanent revolution and emphasis on international intervention, and Joseph Stalin , who advocated socialism in one country and emphasis on domestic industrialisation . Ultimately, by 1930, Trotsky was expelled from the Party and deported from the Soviet Union, leaving Stalin and his supporters in full control of the party and effectively of governing the country. During this time, Marxism-Leninism became the official ideology of the Party. Later into the 1930s, Stalin initiated the Great Purge , a period of widespread paranoia and repression culminating in a series of show trials and the purging of all original Party members . With the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany , the Party actively sought to form "collective security" alliances with western powers. Unable to do so, the USSR established non-aggressive relations with Germany, which were ultimately broken in 1941 with Germany invading the Soviet Union, thus beginning the Great Patriotic War . After the Allied victory in the war, the Party held a doctrine of establishing pro-Stalin governments in the post-war occupied territories and of actively seeking to expand the domain of influence, through proxy wars and espionage . \n After Stalin\'s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev rose to power. In 1956, at the 20th Party Congress , Khrushchev delivered the " Secret Speech ", which denounced the cult of personality around Stalin and the political repression of his regime. Khrushchev initiated a policy of de-Stalinisation , which removed the image of Stalin from public life entirely, terminated the correctional labour camp system , and ended the most repressive aspects of the Stalinist system; this period was known as the " Khrushchev Thaw ". The Party maintained Marxism-Leninism as its ideology while rejecting Stalinism , thus splitting the two as distinct ideologies. This would later lead to a disintegration of relations with the Communist Party of China during the 1960s, which under Mao \'s leadership upheld a favourable view of Stalin\'s legacy. \n Into the late 1980s, under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev , policies of glasnost and perestroika were implemented, which sought to liberalise the political and economic systems of the Soviet Union. Once the Party lost its constitutional status as the sole governing force of country, the Union began to crumble. The party ceased to exist at the All-Union level after the coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat attempt in 1991 and was succeeded by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation in Russia and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Names \n 2 Structure CPSU \n \n 2.1 Membership \n \n \n 3 History \n \n 3.1 End of Communist rule \n \n \n 4 Branches \n 5 Conventions (1917\xe2\x80\x931991) \n 6 Footnotes \n 7 See also \n 8 External links \n \n \n \n \n Names \n \n March 1898 creation of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party \n The Bolshevik faction emerged within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a de facto political bloc separate from the Mensheviks in 1903. \n The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (bolsheviks) , RSDLP(b) ( Russian : \xd0\xa0\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\xcc\x81\xd0\xb9\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xa1\xd0\xbe\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbb-\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbc\xd0\xbe\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xcc\x81\xd1\x87\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xa0\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xcc\x81\xd1\x87\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\x9f\xd0\xb0\xcc\x81\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f (\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x88\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb8\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xcc\x81\xd0\xb2 ), \xd0\xa0\xd0\xa1\xd0\x94\xd0\xa0\xd0\x9f(\xd0\xb1)). \n In 1918 leaders adopted the name Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) ( Russian : \xd0\xa0\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xb8\xcc\x81\xd0\xb9\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\x9a\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc\xd0\xbc\xd1\x83\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xcc\x81\xd1\x87\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\x9f\xd0\xb0\xcc\x81\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f(\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x88\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb8\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xcc\x81\xd0\xb2 ), \xd0\xa0\xd0\x9a\xd0\x9f (\xd0\xb1)), decision of the 7th Extraordinary Party Congress, March 6\xe2\x80\x938, 1918. \n In 1925 the party was renamed the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) ( Russian : \xd0\x92\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd1\x8e\xcc\x81\xd0\xb7\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\x9a\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc\xd0\xbc\xd1\x83\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xcc\x81\xd1\x87\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\x9f\xd0\xb0\xcc\x81\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f (\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x88\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb8\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xcc\x81\xd0\xb2 ), \xd0\x92\xd0\x9a\xd0\x9f(\xd0\xb1)), decision of the 14th Party Congress, December 18\xe2\x80\x9331, 1925. \n In 1952 the party was renamed as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , decision of the 19th Party Congress, October 5\xe2\x80\x9314, 1952. \n \n Structure CPSU \n Main article: Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n The governing body of the CPSU was the Party Congress which was held once in 1\xe2\x80\x935 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a Central Committee which, in turn, would elect a Politburo . Under Stalin, the most powerful position in the party became the General Secretary who was elected by the Politburo. [ 2 ] In 1952 the title of General Secretary became First Secretary and the Politburo became the Presidium before reverting to their former names under Leonid Brezhnev in 1966. \n In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary and the Politburo. \n \n Party Congress of delegates \n Central Committee \n Politburo (Bureau of Presidium in 1952-53) \n General Secretary of Party \n \n At lower levels the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or partkoms (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc). A partkom was headed by the elected "partkom bureau secretary" ("partkom secretary", \xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x82\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c \xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc\xd0\xb0). At enterprises, institutions, kolkhozes , etc., they were called as such, i.e., "partkoms". At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: raikoms (\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb9\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc) at raion level, obkoms (\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc) at oblast levels (known earlier as gubkoms (\xd0\xb3\xd1\x83\xd0\xb1\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc) for guberniyas ), gorkom (\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe\xd1\x80\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc) at city level, etc. \n The bottom level of the Party was the "primary party organization" (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb8\xd1\x87\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xbe\xd1\x80\xd0\xb3\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb7\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f) or "party cell" (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x8f\xd1\x87\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb9\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0). It was created within any organizational kpss entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called "party bureau" (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xb1\xd1\x8e\xd1\x80\xd0\xbe, \xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb1\xd1\x8e\xd1\x80\xd0\xbe). A partbureau was headed by the elected "bureau secretary" (\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x82\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c \xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb1\xd1\x8e\xd1\x80\xd0\xbe). \n At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an " exempt secretary " (\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd0\xb2\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb6\xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd1\x8b\xd0\xb9 \xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd1\x82\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x8c), who drew his salary from the Party money. During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows: \n \n Russian SFSR: 7.2% \n Ukraine: 5.35% (1976) \n Moldavia: 3.43% (1975) \n Tajikistan: less than 3% \n The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974) \n \n Membership \n \n \n \n  \nCPSU membership card (1989) \n \n \n Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or nomenklatura in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. [ citation needed ] Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to dachas and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. [ citation needed ] It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party. \n Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under Joseph Stalin . Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member, one had to be approved by various committees and one\'s past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the Young Pioneers , and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the Komsomol (Young Communist League). Ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to party discipline or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. Komsomol and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and "social tasks" (\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb1\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd0\xb0). \n In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the "Lenin Levy") of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to "proletarianize" the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the Old Bolsheviks and reducing their influence in the party. \n In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million. [ 3 ] In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000 [ 4 ] \n By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members, but as a result of the Great Purge party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. [ citation needed ] In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR\'s adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, and 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in 14 of the USSR\'s 15 republics. In the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU. \n History \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Organisation \n \n \n \n Congress \n General Secretary \n Politburo \n Secretariat \n Orgburo \n Central Committee \n Control Commission \n Auditing Commission \n Komsomol \n Pravda \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Party leadership \n \n \n \n \n Party leaders: \n \n \n \n Vladimir Lenin \n Joseph Stalin \n Nikita Khrushchev \n Leonid Brezhnev \n Yuri Andropov \n Konstantin Chernenko \n Mikhail Gorbachev \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Politburo members: \n \n \n \n 1910s \n 1920s \n 1930s \n 1940s \n 1950s \n 1960s \n 1970s \n 1980s \n 1990s \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Secretariat members: \n \n \n \n 1910s \n 1920s \n 1930s \n 1940s \n 1950s \n 1960s \n 1970s \n 1980s \n 1990s \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Departments of the \nCentral Committee \n \n \n \n Administrative Organs \n Agriculture \n Chemical Industry \n Construction \n Culture \n Defence Industry \n Foreign Cadres \n General \n Heavy Industry \n Information \n International \n Light- and Food Industry \n Machine Industry \n Organisational-party Work \n Planning and Financial Organs \n Political Administration of the Ministry of Defence \n Propaganda \n Science and Education \n Trade and Consumers\' Services \n Transportation-Communications \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Republican branches \n \n \n \n Armenia \n Azerbaijan \n Belorussia \n Bukhara \n Estonia \n Georgia \n Karelo-Finland \n Kazakhstan \n Khorezm \n Kirghizia \n Latvia \n Lithuania \n Moldavia \n Russia \n Tajikistan \n Transcaucasia \n Turkestan \n Turkmenistan \n Ukraine \n Uzbekistan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Main article: History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n End of Communist rule \n In 1989, Gorbachev allowed other political associations ( de facto political parties ) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its vanguard status. The Communist Party\'s power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly created Soviet Presidency , whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev. \n The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the August Coup in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the New Union Treaty was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the "State Emergency Committee" seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president Gennadiy Yanayev was named acting president. The committee\'s eight members included KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov , Internal Affairs Minister Boris Pugo , Defense Minister Dmitriy Yazov , and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov . The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of Boris Yeltsin who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the Russian SFSR on August 26. The KGB was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin\'s action was later declared unconstitutional, but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist. \n The Communist Party in between Gorbachev\'s resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the 28th Congress of the CPSU in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was Vladimir Ivashko , chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of President of the Soviet Union (held by Gorbachev) and President of the Russian SFSR (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party\'s activity was suspended by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union . \n Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ( Archive of the President of the Russian Federation , Russian State Archive of Contemporary History , Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History , State Archive of the Russian Federation ), many of them remain classified. \n After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation . Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia. \n In other republics, communists established the Armenian Communist Party , Communist Party of Azerbaijan , Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan , Communist Party of Ukraine , Party of Communists of Belarus , Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova , Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Communist Party of Tajikistan . Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union . \n \n In Turkmenistan , the local party apparatus led by Saparmurat Niyazov was renamed the Democratic Party of Turkmenistan and abandoned communist ideology. \n In Uzbekistan , Islam Karimov changed the CPSU branch into the People\'s Democratic Party . \n In Georgia , the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the Communist Party of Georgia (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the United Communist Party of Georgia (SEKP). \n In Estonia , the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the Estonian Democratic Labour Party (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the Communist Party of Estonia . \n In Lithuania , the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of "progressive" communists led by Algirdas Brazauskas established the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania in 1992. \n In Latvia , communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the Latvian Social Democratic Party . The remnants of CPSU became the Union of Communists of Latvia , which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the Socialist Party of Latvia . \n \n Branches \n \n Source: \xd0\xa1\xd0\xbf\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd0\xb2\xd0\xbe\xd1\x87\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd0\xba \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe \xd0\xb8\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd1\x80\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb8 \xd0\x9a\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbc\xd0\xbc\xd1\x83\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd1\x87\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb9 \xd0\xbf\xd0\xb0\xd1\x80\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb8 \xd0\xb8 \xd0\xa1\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd1\x82\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe \xd0\xa1\xd0\xbe\xd1\x8e\xd0\xb7\xd0\xb0 1898-1991 (Handbook on the History of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union) [ 6 ] \n \n \n Republic \n Branch \n \n \n Russian SFSR \n Communist Party of the RSFSR (1990\xe2\x80\x931991) [ 5 ] \n \n \n Ukrainian SSR \n Communist Party of Ukraine \n \n \n Byelorussian SSR \n Communist Party of Byelorussia \n \n \n Uzbek SSR \n Communist Party of Uzbekistan \n \n \n Kazakh SSR \n Communist Party of Kazakhstan \n \n \n Georgian SSR \n Communist Party of Georgia \n \n \n Azerbaijan SSR \n Communist Party of Azerbaijan \n \n \n Lithuanian SSR \n Communist Party of Lithuania \n \n \n Moldovan SSR \n Communist Party of Moldova \n \n \n Latvian SSR \n Communist Party of Latvia \n \n \n Kirghiz SSR \n Communist Party of Kirghizia \n \n \n Tajik SSR \n Communist Party of Tajikistan \n \n \n Armenian SSR \n Communist Party of Armenia \n \n \n Turkmen SSR \n Communist Party of Turkmenistan \n \n \n Estonian SSR \n Communist Party of Estonia \n \n \n Turkestan ASSR (1918-1924) \n Communist Party of Turkestan \n \n \n Bukharan SSR (1920\xe2\x80\x931925) \n Communist Party of Bukhara \n \n \n Khorezm SSR (1920\xe2\x80\x931925) \n Communist Party of Khorezm \n \n \n Karelo-Finnish SSR (1940\xe2\x80\x931956) \n Communist Party of the Karelo-Finnish SSR \n \n \n Transcaucasian SFSR (1922\xe2\x80\x931936) \n Transcaucasian Regional Communist Party of the RKP(b)/VKP(b) \n \n \n \n \n Conventions (1917\xe2\x80\x931991) \n \n \n Gathering \n Date \n Delegates \n Voting + Non-Voting \n Notes \n \n \n 7th All-Russian Conference of the RSDRP(b) \n May 7\xe2\x80\x9312, 1917 \n 131 + 18 \n \n \n \n VI Congress of the RSDRP(b) \n August 8\xe2\x80\x9316, 1917 \n 157 + 110 \n \n \n \n VII Extraordinary Congress of the RKP(b) \n March 6\xe2\x80\x938, 1918 \n 47 + 59 \n \n \n \n VIII Congress of the RKP(b) \n March 18\xe2\x80\x9323, 1919 \n 301 + 102 \n \n \n \n 8th All-Russian Conference of the RKP(b) \n December 2\xe2\x80\x934, 1919 \n 45 + 73 \n \n \n \n IX Congress of the RKP(b) \n March 29 \xe2\x80\x93 April 5, 1920 \n 554 + 162 \n \n \n \n 9th All-Russian Conference of the RKP(b) \n September 22\xe2\x80\x9325, 1920 \n 116 + 125 \n \n \n \n X Congress of the RKP(b) \n March 8\xe2\x80\x9316, 1921 \n 694 + 296 \n Factions formally banned in the Communist Party. \n \n \n 10th All-Russian Conference of the RKP(b) \n May 26\xe2\x80\x9328, 1921 \n 239 \n \n \n \n XI Congress of the RKP(b) \n March 27 \xe2\x80\x93 April 2, 1922 \n 522 + 165 \n \n \n \n 11th All-Russian Conference of the RKP(b) \n August 4\xe2\x80\x937, 1922 \n 129 + 92 \n \n \n \n XII Congress of the RKP(b) \n April 17\xe2\x80\x9325, 1923 \n 409 + 417 \n \n \n \n 13th Conference of the RKP(b) \n January 16\xe2\x80\x9318, 1924 \n 128 + 222 \n \n \n \n XIII Congress of the RKP(b) \n May 23\xe2\x80\x9331, 1924 \n 748 + 416 \n \n \n \n 14th Conference of the RKP(b) \n April 27\xe2\x80\x9329, 1925 \n 178 + 392 \n \n \n \n XIV Congress of the VKP(b) \n December 18\xe2\x80\x9331, 1925 \n 665 + 641 \n Changes party name to "All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)." \n \n \n 15th Conference of the VKP(b) \n October 26 \xe2\x80\x93 November 3, 1926 \n 194 + 640 \n \n \n \n XV Congress of the VKP(b) \n December 2\xe2\x80\x9319, 1927 \n 898 + 771 \n \n \n \n 16th Conference of the VKP(b) \n April 23\xe2\x80\x9329, 1929 \n 254 + 679 \n \n \n \n XVI Congress of the VKP(b) \n June 26 \xe2\x80\x93 July 13, 1930 \n 1268 + 891 \n \n \n \n 17th Conference of the VKP(b) \n January 30 \xe2\x80\x93 February 4, 1932 \n 386 + 525 \n \n \n \n XVII Congress of the VKP(b) \n January 26 \xe2\x80\x93 February 10, 1934 \n 1225 + 736 \n So-called "Congress of the Victors." \n \n \n XVIII Congress of the VKP(b) \n March 10\xe2\x80\x9321, 1939 \n 1569 + 466 \n \n \n \n 18th Conference of the VKP(b) \n February 15\xe2\x80\x9320, 1941 \n 456 + 138 \n \n \n \n XIX Congress of the CPSU \n October 5\xe2\x80\x9314, 1952 \n 1192 + 167 \n Changes party name to "Communist Party of the Soviet Union." \n \n \n XX Congress of the CPSU \n February 14\xe2\x80\x9325, 1956 \n 1355 + 81 \n Many delegates hear so-called "Secret Speech" of N.S.

More specifically, it is the view that revolution is necessary to achieve a transition from capitalism to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the working class so that the state is directly controlled by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests [ 1 ] as a precondition for establishing socialism. \n Revolutionary socialism encompasses multiple social and political movements that in some cases define "revolution" differently from one another. These include movements based on Orthodox Marxist theory, such as Luxemburgism , Impossibilism and DeLeonism ; as well as movements based on Leninism and the theory of Vanguardist -led revolution, such as Marxism-Leninism , Trotskyism and Maoism . Revolutionary socialism also includes non-Marxist movements like anarchism , revolutionary syndicalism and some forms of democratic socialism . \n It is used in contrast to the reformism of social democracy , which is not anti-capitalist in form. Revolutionary socialism is opposed to social movements that seek to gradually ameliorate the economic and social problems of capitalism through political reform. \n Revolutionary socialism also exists in contrast to the concept of small revolutionary groups seizing power without first achieving mass support, termed Blanquism . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Origins \n 2 The First World War and Zimmerwald \n 3 The Russian revolution of 1917 and after \n 4 See also \n 5 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Origins \n \n \n \n  \n Karl Marx , 1875. \n \n \n In the Communist Manifesto , Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote: [ 2 ] \n \n All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air.\n Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie. \nIn depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat. \n \xe2\x80\x94 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels \n \n Scholars have pointed out that the term "revolution" as used by Marx, Engels and their followers tends to refer to complete change of a social and economic nature by a mass movement of the "immense majority" (as shown by the quote above). In addition, if this revolutionary change was not opposed by the existing ruling elite, Marx and Engels contended, it could be carried out peacefully. [ 3 ]  [ 4 ] By contrast, the Blanquist view emphasised the overthrow by force of the ruling elite in government by an active minority of revolutionaries, who then proceed to implement socialist change, disregarding the state of readiness of society as a whole and the mass of the population in particular for revolutionary change. \n The reformist viewpoint was introduced into Marxist thought by Eduard Bernstein , one of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). From 1896 to 1898, Bernstein published a series of articles entitled "Probleme des Sozialismus" ("Problems of Socialism"). These articles led to a debate on revisionism in the SPD, and can be seen as the origins of a reformist trend within Marxism. \n In 1900, Rosa Luxemburg wrote Social Reform or Revolution , a polemic against Bernstein\'s position. The work of reforms, Luxemburg argued, could only be carried on, "in the framework of the social form created by the last revolution". In order to advance society to socialism from the capitalist \'social form\', a social revolution will be necessary: [ 5 ] \n \n Bernstein, thundering against the conquest of political power as a theory of Blanquist violence, has the misfortune of labeling as a Blanquist error that which has always been the pivot and the motive force of human history. From the first appearance of class societies, having class struggle as the essential content of their history, the conquest of political power has been the aim of all rising classes. Here is the starting point and end of every historic period\xe2\x80\xa6In modern times, we see it in the struggle of the bourgeoisie against feudalism. \n \xe2\x80\x94Rosa Luxemburg, Social Reform or Revolution \n \n Vladimir Lenin attacked Bernstein\xe2\x80\x99s position in his What is to be Done . When Bernstein first put forward his ideas the majority of the SPD rejected them. The 1899 Congress of the SPD reaffirmed the Erfurt programme, as did the 1901 congress. The 1903 congress denounced "revisionist efforts". \n [ edit ] The First World War and Zimmerwald \n However on 4 August 1914 the SPD members of the Reichstag voted for the government\xe2\x80\x99s war budget, while the French and Belgium socialists publicly supported their governments. Vladimir Lenin , Leon Trotsky , Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg , together with a small number of other Marxists opposed to the war, came together in the Zimmerwald Conference in September 1915. This conference saw the beginning of the end of the uneasy coexistence of revolutionary socialists and reformist socialists in the Second International . The conference adopted a proposal by Trotsky to avoid an immediate split with the Second International. At first opposed to it, in the end Lenin voted [ 6 ] for Trotsky\'s resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists. \n In December, 1915 and March, 1916, eighteen Social Democratic representatives, the Haase-Ledebour Group, voted against war credits, and were expelled from the Social Democratic Party. Liebknecht wrote Revolutionary Socialism in Germany in 1916, arguing that this group was not a revolutionary socialist group, despite their refusal to vote for war credits, further defining, in his view, what was meant by a revolutionary socialist.

By contrast, the October revolution is popularly [ citation needed ] portrayed as a putsch or coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat along the lines of Blanquism. \n Revolutionary socialists, particularly Trotskyists , argue that the Bolsheviks only seized power as the expression of the mass of workers and peasants, whose desires are brought into being by an organised force - the revolutionary party. Marxists such as Trotskyists argue that Lenin did not advocate seizing of power until he felt that the majority of the population, represented in the soviets , demanded revolutionary change and no longer supported the reformist government of Alexander Kerensky established in the earlier revolution of February 1917: \n \n "Lenin, after the experience of the reconnoiter, withdrew the slogan of the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government. But he did not withdraw it for any set period of time, for so many weeks or months, but strictly in dependence upon how quickly the revolt of the masses against the conciliationists would grow." \n \xe2\x80\x94Leon Trotsky, Lessons of October, Chapter Four, The April Conference \n \n For these Marxists, the fact that the Bolsheviks won a majority (in alliance with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries ) in the second all-Russian congress of Soviets - democratically elected bodies - which convened at the time of the October revolution, shows that they had popular support of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers, the vast majority of Russian society. \n In his pamphlet, The Lessons of October, published in 1923, [ 8 ] Trotsky argued that military power lay in the hands of the Bolsheviks before the October revolution was carried out but this power was not used against the government until the Bolsheviks gained mass support. \n The mass of the soldiers began to be led by the Bolshevik party after the \'July days\' of 1917, and followed only the orders of the Military Revolutionary Committee under the leadership of Trotsky in October (also termed the \'Revolutionary Military Committee\' in Lenin\'s collected works). [ 9 ] Yet Trotsky only mobilised the Military Revolutionary Committee to seize power on the advent of the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers\' and Soldiers\' Deputies, which began on 25 October 1917. \n Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Third International was founded. This International became widely identified with Communism , but also defined itself in terms of revolutionary socialism. However, in 1938, Trotskyists formed the Fourth International because they thought that the Third International was lost to Stalinism ; this latter International became identified with revolutionary socialism. \n Emerging from the Communist International , but critical of the post-1924 Soviet Union, the Trotskyist tradition in Western Europe and elsewhere uses the term \'revolutionary socialism\'. For instance, in 1932, the first issue of the first Canadian Trotskyist newspaper, The Vanguard , published an editorial, "Revolutionary Socialism vs Reformism". [ 10 ] Today, many Trotskyist groups advocate "revolutionary socialism" as opposed to reformism, and are considered, and consider themselves, "revolutionary socialists". [ 11 ]  Luxemburgism is another revolutionary socialist tradition. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Anarchism \n Anarcho-Syndicalism \n Impossibilism \n Leninism \n Luxemburgism \n Political revolution \n Social revolution \n Socialism from below \n Vanguardism \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  What Revolutionary Socialism Means by Carl D.

[ 1 ]  [ 2 ] \n The term socialist economics may also be applied to analysis of former and existing economic systems that call themselves "socialist", such as the works of Hungarian economist J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai . [ 3 ] \n Socialist economics has been associated with different schools of economic thought, most notably Marxian economics , institutional economics , evolutionary economics and neoclassical economics . Early socialism, like Ricardian socialism , was based on classical economics . During the 20th century, proposals and models for planned economies and market socialism were based heavily on neoclassical economics or a synthesis of neoclassical economics with Marxian or institutional economics. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Description \n \n 1.1 Socialist economic planning \n 1.2 Normative aspects \n 1.3 Economic value in socialism \n 1.4 Socialist economies in theory \n \n \n 2 Socialist economies in practice \n \n 2.1 Centrally planned economies \n \n 2.1.1 Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n 2.1.2 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n 2.1.3 Post-Soviet reforms \n \n \n 2.2 People\'s Republic of China \n 2.3 Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n 2.4 State capitalism \n \n 2.4.1 Singapore \n 2.4.2 India \n \n \n 2.5 Paris Commune \n 2.6 Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n \n 2.6.1 Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n 2.6.2 Self-managed enterprises \n \n \n 2.7 Anarchist Spain \n \n \n 3 History of socialist economic thought \n \n 3.1 Utopian socialism \n 3.2 Socialism and classical political economy \n 3.3 Socialist political economy before Marx \n 3.4 Das Kapital \n 3.5 Anarchist economics \n 3.6 After Marx \n \n \n 4 Criticisms \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n 7 Further reading \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Description \n See also: Socialist mode of production \n \n "I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society." \n \xe2\x80\x94 Albert Einstein , Why Socialism? , 1949 [ 4 ]  \n \n A socialist economy is a system of production where goods and services are produced directly for use , in contrast to a capitalist economic system, where goods and services are produced to generate profit (and therefore indirectly for use). [ 5 ] Goods and services would be produced for their usefulness, or for their use-value, eliminating the need for market-induced needs to ensure a sufficient amount of demand for products to be sold at a profit. Production in a socialist economy is therefore "planned" or "coordinated", and does not suffer from the business cycle inherent to capitalism. In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the factors of production and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market. Karl Marx stated that "lower-stage communism" would consist of compensation based on the amount of labor one contributes to the social product. [ 6 ] \n The ownership of the means of production varies in different socialist theories. It can either be based on public ownership by a state apparatus; direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative ; or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production. \n Management and control over the activities of enterprises is based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximize occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals. [ 7 ] \n However, the economies of the former Socialist states , excluding SFR Yugoslavia, were based on bureaucratic, top-down administration of economic directives and micromanagement of the worker in the workplace inspired by capitalist models of scientific management . As a result, socialists have argued that they were not socialist due to the lack of equal power-relations in the workplace, the presence of a new "elite", and because of the commodity production that took place in these economies. These economic and social systems have been classified as being either Bureaucratic collectivist , State capitalist or Deformed workers\' states , the exact nature of the USSR et al remains unresolved within the socialist movement [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economic planning \n Main article: Economic planning \n Economic planning is a mechanism for the allocation of economic inputs and decision-making based on direct allocation, in contrast to the market mechanism , which is based on indirect allocation. [ 9 ] An economy based on economic planning appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers rather than market transactions involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level. \n Economic planning is not synonymous with the concept of a command economy , which existed in the Soviet Union , and was based on a highly bureaucratic administration of the entire economy in accordance to a comprehensive plan formulated by a central planning agency, which specified output requirements for productive units and tried to micromanage the decisions and policies of enterprises. The command economy is based on the organizational model of a capitalist firm, but applies it to the entire economy. [ 10 ] \n Various advocates of economic planning have been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand the local conditions and rapid changes in the economy. Therefore, central planners would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity because they lacked this informal information. [ 11 ] \n Economic planning in socialism takes a different form than economic planning in capitalist mixed economies (such as Dirigisme , Central banking and Indicative planning ); in the former case planning refers to production of use-value directly (planning of production), while in the latter case planning refers to the planning of capital accumulation in order to stabilize or increase the efficiency of this process. \n [ edit ] Normative aspects \n See also: Socialist critique of capitalism \n The goal of socialist economics is to neutralize capital (or, in the case of market socialism , to subject investment and capital to social planning [ 12 ] ), to coordinate the production of goods and services to directly satisfy demand (as opposed to market-induced needs), and to eliminate the business cycle and crisis of overproduction that occur as a result of an economy based on capital accumulation and private property in the means of production. \n Socialists generally aim to achieve greater equality in decision-making and economic affairs, grant workers greater control of the means of production and their workplace, and to eliminate exploitation by directing the surplus value to employees. Free access to the means of subsistence is a requisite for liberty, because it ensures that all work is voluntary and no class or individual has the power to coerce others into performing alienating work. \n The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labor from alienating work, and therefore freedom from having to perform such labor to receive access to the material necessities for life. It is argued that freedom from necessity would maximize individual liberty, as individuals would be able to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labor for others (the power-elite or ruling class in this case) via mechanisms of social control, such as the labor market and the state. The stage of economic development in which this is possible is contingent upon advances in the productive capabilities of society. This advanced stage of social relations and economic organization is called pure communism . \n [ edit ] Economic value in socialism \n Socialist economic theories base the value of a good or service on its use value , rather than its cost of production ( labor theory of value ) or its exchange value ( Marginal Utility ). [ 13 ] \n Other socialist theories, such as mutualism and market socialism , attempt to apply the labor theory of value to socialism, so that the price of a good or service is adjusted to equal the amount of labor time expended in its production. The labor-time expended by each worker would correspond to labor credits, which would be used as a currency to acquire goods and services. \n Market socialists that base their models on neoclassical economics , and thus marginal utility , such as Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner , have proposed that publicly owned enterprises set their price to equal marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency . \n Anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value and exchange value itself, advocated a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in theory \n Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert identify five economic models within the rubric of socialist economics: [ 15 ] \n \n Public Enterprise Centrally Planned Economy in which all property is owned by the State and all key economic decisions are made centrally by the State, e.g. the former Soviet Union. \n Public Enterprise State-Managed Market Economy , one form of market socialism which attempts to use the price mechanism to increase economic efficiency , while all decisive productive assets remain in the ownership of the state, e.g. socialist market economy in China after reform. \n A mixed economy , where public and private ownership are mixed, and where industrial planning is ultimately subordinate to market allocation, the model generally adopted by social democrats e.g. in twentieth century Sweden. \n Public Enterprise Employee Managed Market Economies , another form of market socialism in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free market exchange of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid twentieth century Yugoslavia, Two more theoretical models are Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar \'s Progressive Utilization Theory and Economic democracy . \n Public Enterprise Participatory Planning , an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. stateless communism , libertarian socialism . An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the Spanish revolution . More developed theoretical models include those of Karl Polanyi , Participatory Economics and the negotiated coordination model of Pat Devine , as well as in Cornelius Castoriadis \'s pamphlet "Workers\' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society". [ 16 ] \n \n Additionally, J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai identifies five distinct classifications for socialism: \n \n Classical / Marxist conception, where socialism is a stage of economic development in which wage labour, private property in the means of production and monetary relations have been made redundant through the development of the productive forces, so that capital accumulation has been superseded by economic planning . Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the "anarchy of production" of capitalism. \n Walrasian / Market Socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative-enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises. \n Leninist conception, which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class, and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning (a "command economy"). \n Social Democratic concept, based on the capitalist mode of production , which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism, and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property; instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state, which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise. \n East Asian model, or socialist market economy , based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader. [ 17 ] \n \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in practice \n Although a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as wage labor , the accumulation of capital , and commodity production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history. \n Various forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 examples of this include cooperative enterprises in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free-software movement based on social peer-to-peer production . \n [ edit ] Centrally planned economies \n A centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with centralised state planning . This model is usually associated with the Soviet-style command economy . In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. The planning process was based around material balances &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the USSR and Eastern bloc economies, this economic model was also utilized by the People\'s Republic of China , Socialist Republic of Vietnam , Republic of Cuba and North Korea . \n [ edit ] Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n Various scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy, and specifically, the Soviet model of economic development, constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the accumulation of capital and the extraction of surplus value from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union (and other Soviet-style economies) were state capitalist economies. [ 18 ] More fundamentally, these economies are still structured around the dynamic of capitalism: the accumulation of capital and production for profit (as opposed to being based on production for use &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the defining criterion for socialism), and have not yet transcended the system of capitalism but are in fact a variation of capitalism based on a process of state-directed accumulation. [ 19 ] \n Other socialist critics point to the lack of socialist social relations in these economies&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 specifically the lack of self-management , a bureaucratic elite based on hierarchical and centralized powers of authority, and the lack of genuine worker control over the means of production&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 leading them to conclude that they were not socialist but either bureaucratic collectivism or state capitalism . [ 20 ]  Trotskyists argue they are neither socialist nor capitalist&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 but are deformed workers\' states . \n This analysis is consistent with Lenin\'s April Theses , which stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism, which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers\' Deputies. Furthermore, these "Communist states" often do not claim to have achieved socialism in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \'s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976, [ 21 ] and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism". [ 22 ] \n This view is challenged by Stalinists and their followers, who claim that socialism was established in the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin came to power and instituted the system of five year plans. Joseph Stalin introduced the theory of Socialism in one country , which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. \n [ edit ] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n Main article: Economy of the Soviet Union \n See also: Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union) , Gosplan ,&#160;and Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union \n The Soviet Union and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally planned economy . They dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production. Workers were still, however, effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers\' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx\'s views of historical materialism , and his views of the process of socialization. \n The characteristics of this model of economy were: \n \n Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers. Critics [ who? ] of both left and right persuasions have argued that the economy was plagued by incentive-related problems; [ citation needed ] claiming, for instance, that the system incentivized enterprise managers to underreport their unit\'s productive capacities so that their quotas would be easier to achieve, especially since the manager\'s bonuses were linked to the fulfillment of quotas. \n \n \n Allocation through political control . In contrast with systems where prices determined allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so after the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place. \n Full employment . Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan. \n Clearing goods by planning : if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use. \n Five Year Plans for the long-term development of key industries. \n \n [ edit ] Post-Soviet reforms \n After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, many of the remaining socialist states presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. \n The Republic of Cuba , under the leadership of Raul Castro , has begun to encourage co-operatives and self-employment in a move to reduce the central role of state enterprise and state management over the economy, with the goal of building a co-operative form of socialism. [ 23 ] \n Vietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the socialist-oriented market economy . This economic system is a form of mixed-economy consisting of state, private, co-operative and individual enterprises coordinated by the market mechanism . This system is intended to be transitional stage in the development of socialism. \n [ edit ] People\'s Republic of China \n Main article: Economy of the People\'s Republic of China \n China embraced a socialist planned economy after the Communist victory in its Civil War. Private property and private ownership of capital were abolished, and various forms of wealth made subject to state control or to workers\' councils. \n The Chinese economy broadly adopted a similar system of production quotas and full employment by fiat to the Russian model. The Great Leap Forward saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture, and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected, (e.g., there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after three years. \n In recent decades China has opened its economy to foreign investment and to market-based trade, and has continued to experience strong economic growth. It has carefully managed the transition from a planned socialist economy to a market economy, officially referred to as the socialist commodity market economy , which has been likened to capitalism by some outside observers. [ 24 ] As a result, centralized economic planning has little relevance in China today. \n The current Chinese economic system is characterized by state ownership combined with a strong private sector that privately owned enterprises that generate about 33% [ 25 ] (People\'s Daily Online 2005) to over 50% of GDP in 2005, [ 26 ] with a BusinessWeek article estimating 70% [ 27 ] of GDP, a figure that might be even greater considering the Chengbao system . Some western observers note that the private sector is likely underestimated by state officials in calculation of GDP due to its propensity to ignore small private enterprises that are not registered. [ 28 ] Most of the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, which is left to the management of both state and private firms. A significant amount of privately owned firms exist, especially in the consumer service sector. [ 29 ] \n The state sector is concentrated in the \'commanding heights\' of the economy with a growing private sector engaged primarily in commodity production and light industry. Centralized directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and production quotas has been superseded by the free-market mechanism for most of the economy and directive planning is utilized in some large state industries. [ 29 ] A major difference from the old planned economy is the privatization of state institutions. 150 state-owned enterprises remain and report directly to the central government, most having a number of subsidiaries. [ 30 ] By 2008, these state-owned corporations have became increasingly dynamic largely contributing to the increase in revenue for the state. [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] The state-sector led the economic recovery process and increased economic growth in 2009 after the financial crises. [ 33 ] \n This type of economic system is defended from a Marxist perspective which states that a socialist planned economy can only be possible after first establishing the necessary comprehensive commodity market economy, letting it fully develop until it exhausts its historical stage and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy. [ 34 ] Proponents of this model distinguish themselves from market socialists who believe that economic planning is unattainable, undesirable or ineffective at distributing goods, viewing the market as the solution rather than a temporary phase in development of a socialist planned economy. \n The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has pursued similar economic reforms, though less extensive, which have resulted in what is officially called a Socialist-oriented market economy , a mixed economy where the state plays a dominant role intended to be a transitional phase in establishment of a socialist economy. [ 35 ] \n [ edit ] Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n Main article: Social democracy \n Many of the industrialized, open countries of Western Europe experimented with one form of social democratic mixed economies or another during the 20th century. These include Britain (mixed economy and welfare state) from 1945 to 1979, France (state capitalism and indicative planning) from 1945 to 1982 under dirigisme, Sweden (social democratic welfare state) and Norway (state capitalist mixed economy) to the present. They can be regarded as social democratic experiments, because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production. \n Nevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a purely private capitalist model. Variations range from social democratic welfare states , such as in Sweden, to mixed economies where a major percentage of GDP comes from the state sector, such as in Norway, which ranks among the highest countries in quality of life and equality of opportunity for its citizens. [ 36 ] Elements of these efforts persist throughout Europe, even if they have repealed some aspects of public control and ownership. They are typically characterized by: \n \n Nationalization of key industries, such as mining, oil, steel, energy and transportation. A common model is for a sector to be taken over by the state and then one or more publicly owned corporations set up for its day-to-day running. Advantages of nationalization include: the ability of the state to direct investment in key industries, the distribution of state profits from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals, greater control of the industries by and for the workers, and the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace. \n Redistribution of wealth , through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of progressive taxation regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common. \n Social security schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and parental leave. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities. \n Minimum wages , employment protection and trade union recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce full employment . There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged strikes rather than negotiation. \n National planning for industrial development. \n Demand management in a Keynesian fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment. \n \n [ edit ] State capitalism \n Various state capitalist economies, which consist of large commercial state enterprises that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, have evolved in countries that have been influenced by various elected socialist political parties and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism, and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology. \n [ edit ] Singapore \n Main article: Economy of Singapore \n Singapore pursued a state-led model of economic development under the People\'s Action Party , which initially adopted a Leninist approach to politics and a broad socialist model of economic development. [ 37 ] The PAP was initially a member of the Socialist International . Singapore\'s economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises and government-linked companies through Temasek Holdings , which generate 60% of Singapore\'s GDP. [ 38 ] \n The state also provides substantial public housing, free education, health and recreational services, as well as comprehensive public transportation. [ 39 ] Today Singapore is often characterized as having a state capitalist economy that combines economic planning with the free-market. [ 40 ] While government-linked companies generate a majority of Singapore\'s GDP, moderate state planning in the economy has been reduced in recent decades. \n [ edit ] India \n Main article: Economy of India \n After gaining independence from Britain, India adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a mixed economy , it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the USSR or China. Today India is often characterized as having a free-market economy that combines economic planning with the free-market . It did however adopt a very firm focus on national planning with a series of broad Five-Year Plans . \n [ edit ] Paris Commune \n Main article: Paris Commune \n The Paris Commune was considered to be a prototype mode of economic and political organization for a future socialist society by Karl Marx. Private property in the means of production was abolished so that individuals and co-operative associations of producers owned productive property and introduced democratic measures where elected officials received no more in compensation than the average worker and could be recalled at any time. [ 41 ] \n [ edit ] Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n Various forms of socialist organization based on co-operative decision making, workplace democracy and in some cases, production directly for use , have existed within the broader context of the capitalist mode of production since the Paris Commune. New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making. \n Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. [ 42 ] \n Commons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 software is produced solely for their use-value . \n Wikipedia , being based on collaboration and cooperation and a freely associated individuals , has been cited as a template for how socialism might operate. [ 43 ] This is a modern example of what the Paris Commune&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 a template for possible future organization&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 was to Marx in his time. \n [ edit ] Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n Main article: Economy of SFR Yugoslavia \n Yugoslavia pursued a socialist economy based on autogestion or worker-self management. Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were socially owned rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to Edvard Kardelj \'s theory of associated labor. \n [ edit ] Self-managed enterprises \n See also: Cooperative \n The Mondragon Corporation , a federation of cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management, which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures, have been adopted by various private corporations such as Cisco Systems , inc. [ 44 ] But unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership. More fundamentally, employee-owned, self-managed enterprises still operate within the broader context of capitalism and are subject to the accumulation of capital and profit-loss mechanism. \n [ edit ] Anarchist Spain \n Main article: Spanish revolution \n See also: Anarcho-syndicalism \n The Spanish Revolution was a workers\' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain\'s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers. Sam Dolgoff estimated that over 10 million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." \n [ edit ] History of socialist economic thought \n Main article: History of socialism \n Values of socialism have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations, and communal charity of Mediaeval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations. [ 45 ] As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in Enlightenment doctrine such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau \'s Discourse on Inequality , Wilhelm von Humboldt \'s Limits of State Action , or Immanuel Kant \'s insistent defense of the French Revolution . [ 46 ] \n Capitalism appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 land, elaborate machinery, and labour&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 and these imperatives led to the commodification of these elements. [ 47 ] \n According to influential socialist economic historian Karl Polanyi \'s classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre-existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of "primitive accumulation" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter-movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society. These counter-movements, that included, for example, the Luddite rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory. \n As Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market\'s worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively "exploitative", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity. \n Within this context socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s-1850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and Communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830\xe2\x80\x931916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the Soviet Union , and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916\xe2\x80\x931989); and the response of socialism in the neo-liberal era (1990- ). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics. \n [ edit ] Utopian socialism \n Main article: Utopian socialism \n The first theories which came to hold the term "socialism" began to be formulated in the late 18th century, and were termed "socialism" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters, or "capitalists" as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages. (See Iron law of wages ). \n Socialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the Shakers in America. \n Utopian socialism had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems. \n [ edit ] Socialism and classical political economy \n The first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in Adam Smith , Robert Malthus and David Ricardo . In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a class analysis , a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being unproductive . Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a " general glut ", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war. \n [ edit ] Socialist political economy before Marx \n \n \n \n  \n Charles Fourier , influential early French socialist thinker \n \n \n A key early socialist theorist of political economy was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . He was the most well-known of nineteenth century mutualist theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: Technocrats like Henri de Saint Simon, agrarian radicals like Thomas Spence , William Ogilvie and William Cobbett ; anti-capitalists like Thomas Hodgskin ; communitarian and utopian socialists like Robert Owen , William Thompson and Charles Fourier ; anti-market socialists like John Gray and John Francis Bray ; the Christian mutualist William Batchelder Greene ; as well as the theorists of the Chartist movement and early proponents of syndicalism . [ 48 ] \n The first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon was the first individual to coin the term "socialism". [ 49 ] Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology, which led him to advocate a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and which would be based upon equal opportunities. [ 50 ] Simon advocated a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. [ 49 ] This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organized economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, which embodied a desire for a semi- planned economy . [ 49 ] \n Other early socialist thinkers were influenced by the classical economists. The Ricardian socialists , such as Thomas Hodgskin and Charles Hall, were based on the work of David Ricardo and reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. [ 51 ] \n [ edit ] Das Kapital \n Main article: Das Kapital \n Karl Marx employed systematic analysis in an ambitious attempt to elucidate capitalism\'s contradictory laws of motion, as well as to expose the specific mechanisms by which it exploits and alienates. He radically modified classical political economic theories. Notably, the labor theory of value that had been worked upon by Adam Smith and David Ricardo , was transformed into his characteristic " law of value " and used for the purpose of revealing how commodity fetishism obscures the reality of capitalist society. \n His approach, which Engels would call " scientific socialism ", would stand as the branching point in economic theory: in one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.". [ 52 ] \n Das Kapital is one of the many famous incomplete works of economic theory: Marx had planned four volumes, completed two, and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways the work is modelled on Adam Smith\'s Wealth of Nations , seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption and finance in relation to morality and the state. \n It is a work of philosophy, anthropology and sociology as much as one of economics. However, it has several important statements: \n \n The Law of Value Capitalist production is the production of \xe2\x80\x9can immense multitude of commodities\xe2\x80\x9d or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \xe2\x80\x9cis independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] But rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker\'s wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments. \n \n \n Historical Property Relations Historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the means of production by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban proletariat based on the institution of wage-labour . Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the metabolic rift between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas. [ 54 ] \n Commodity Fetishism Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. "Commodity fetishism" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation. \n Economic Exploitation Workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the surplus value created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists. \n Accumulation Inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist\'s social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money--&gt;Commodity--&gt;Money\', where the capitalist receives an increment or "surplus value" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale. \n Crises Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism\'s inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few. \n Centralization The interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital. \n Material Development As a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the productivity of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure. \n Socialization, and the pre-conditions for Revolution By socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program. [ 55 ] \n \n [ edit ] Anarchist economics \n Main article: Anarchist economics \n Anarchist economics is the set of theories and practices of economics and economic activity within the political philosophy of anarchism . \n Pierre Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings . [ 56 ]  Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought that originates in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production , either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market . [ 57 ] Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. [ 58 ] Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". [ 59 ] Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or usury . \n \n \n \n  \n The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin , influential work which presents the economic vision of anarcho-communism \n \n \n Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary [ 60 ] doctrine that advocates the abolition of the state and private ownership of the means of production . Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. Once collectivization takes place, workers \' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market. [ 61 ] Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin , the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International , and the early Spanish anarchist movement . \n Anarchist communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state , private property , and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production , [ 62 ]  [ 63 ]  direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to ability, to each according to need". [ 64 ]  [ 65 ] Unlike mutualism, collectivist anarchism and marxism, anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value altogether, instead advocating a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Carlo Cafiero , Emilio Covelli , Errico Malatesta , Andrea Costa and other ex- Mazzinian Republicans. [ 66 ] Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin , they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin\'s death. [ 67 ] By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism . \n [ edit ] After Marx \n Marx\'s work sharpened the existing differences between the revolutionary and non-revolutionary socialists. [ citation needed ] \n Non-revolutionary socialists took inspiration from the work of John Stuart Mill , and later John Maynard Keynes and the Keynesians , who provided theoretical justification for (potentially very extensive) state involvement in an existing market economy. [ citation needed ] According to the Keynesians, if the business cycle could be solved by national ownership of key industries and state direction of their investment, class antagonism would be effectively tamed; a compact would be formed between labour and the capitalists. There would be no need for revolution; instead Keynes looked to the eventual "euthanasia of the rentier" sometime in the far future. [ citation needed ] Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki employed Keynesian insights to form the basis of a critical post-Keynesian economics that at times went well beyond liberal reformism. Many original socialist economic ideas would also emerge out of the trade union movement [ citation needed ] (see Guild Socialism ). \n In the wake of Marx, "Marxist" economists developed many different, sometimes contradictory tendencies. [ citation needed ] Some of these tendencies were based on internal disputes about the meaning of some of Marx\'s ideas, including the \'Law of Value\' and his crisis theory. [ citation needed ] Other variations were elaborations that subsequent theorists made in light of real world developments. [ citation needed ] For example the monopoly capitalist school saw Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy attempt to modify Marx\'s theory of capitalist development, which was based upon the assumption of price competition, to reflect the evolution to a stage where both economy and state were subject to the dominating influence of giant corporations. World-systems analysis , would restate Marx\'s ideas about the worldwide division of labour and the drive to accumulate from the holistic perspective of capitalism\'s historical development as a global system. [ citation needed ] \n Accordingly, Immanuel Wallerstein , writing in 1979, maintained that "There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world-system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form. Socialism involves the creation of a new kind of world-system, neither a redistributive world-empire nor a capitalist world-economy but a socialist world-government. I don\'t see this projection as being in the least utopian but I also don\'t feel its institution is imminent. It will be the outcome of a long social struggle in forms that may be familiar and perhaps in very few forms, that will take place in all the areas of the world-economy." [ 68 ] \n Meanwhile other notable strands of reformist and revolutionary socialist economics sprung up that were either only loosely associated with Marxism or wholly independent. Thorsten Veblen is widely credited as the founder of critical institutionalism . His idiosyncratic theorizing included acidic critiques of the inefficiency of capitalism, monopolies, advertising, and the utility of conspicuous consumption . Some institutionalists have addressed the incentive problems experienced by the Soviet Union. Critical institutionalists have worked on the specification of incentive-compatible institutions, usually based on forms of participatory democracy, as a resolution superior to allocation by an autonomous market mechanism. [ citation needed ] \n Another key socialist, closely related to Marx, Keynes, and Gramsci , was Piero Sraffa . [ citation needed ] He mined classical political economy, particularly Ricardo, in an attempt to erect a value theory that was at the same time an explanation of the normal distribution of prices in an economy, as well that of income and economic growth. A key finding was that the net product or surplus in the sphere of production was determined by the balance of bargaining power between workers and capitalists, which was in turn subject to the influence of non-economic, presumably social and political factors. The mutualist tradition associated with Proudhon also continued, influencing the development of libertarian socialism , anarchist communism , syndicalism and distributivism . [ citation needed ] \n In the real world, revolutionary socialists were confronted by the necessity of running an economy, and generally a war economy , and developed ideas and practice in response to the situations they found themselves in. [ citation needed ] \n [ edit ] Criticisms \n Main article: Criticism of socialism \n Criticism of socialist economics comes from market economists, including the classicals, neoclassicals and Austrians, as well as from some anarchist economists. Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist, and market socialist economists, for example, criticize centralized economic planning and propose participatory economics and decentralized socialism. \n Market economists generally criticise socialism for eliminating the free market and its price signals, which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes lack of incentive. They believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP. \n Austrian school economists, such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises , have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the means of production would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market, it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the economic calculation problem . Polish economist Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner rebutted Mises\' argument by developing the Lange Model during the Economic calculation debate . The Lange model states that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition, in that it achieves Pareto efficiency. \n The neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian school argued, as it is the motivation to act on information.

From "The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism" (P.61-63): "More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs...Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology...It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality." \n ^  Socialism and Calculation , on worldsocialism.org. Retrieved February 15, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/overview/calculation.pdf : "Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations...Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness. It is for this that they will be appreciated, evaluated, wanted. . . and produced." \n ^  Kornai, J\xc3\xa1nos: The Socialist System. The Political Economy of Communism .

Part 1: "Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form." \n ^  The Political Economy of Socialism , by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (P.197): "The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organization; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labor. Such an organization involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy." \n ^  "What was the USSR" in depth look at various ideas as to what the economy of the Soviet Union was in relation to socialism http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 \n ^  In Defense of Socialist Planning , by Mandel, Ernest. 1986.

The worker is developing excellent communist work in his workplace along with a group of workers. "We youth are excited and that\'s why we started several months ago to plan this great May Day celebration," said a young comrade enthusiastically. "The young farmworkers and others less young \xe2\x80\x93as the comrades always say\xe2\x80\x94are willing to go to the capital to march for the workers and to distribute our newspaper Red Flag ," announced an excited comrade from the fields. \n  As the International Communist Workers\' Party, we salute May Day 2013, this immense international workers\' day, an unforgettable day for the worldwide working class here in El Salvador and around the world.  Farmworkers, students, housewives, unemployed, we see ourselves represented and we say "present" from the four corners of the country. Every time we celebrate this day of the working class, we put another nail in the coffin of capitalism. Every time we show ourselves to be so strong in the streets we assume a leading role for our working class. There was a group of men and women workers looking at the news. Someone said, "Today is Earth Day, and blah blah blah." Suddenly a worker said, "Why fight only to change the climate if we can change the capitalist system for a communist one and thereby we could save the plant once and for all." This profound idea was immensely appreciated by all the others present. \nFor several months now, the clubs of the International Communist Workers\' Party were visited throughout the whole country, from the mountains to the cities. Communist work was at its peak level. It has been a very encouraging effort, since on all sides everyone breathed an atmosphere of joy and camaraderie. The comrades have put all of their experience and spirit into preparing articles for Red Flag, making banners and shirts and producing all the communist literature needed for May Day. \nThe ideal of building ICWP in the vital and strategic areas of the factories and the army is being strengthened with the commemoration of this International Workers\' Day. On this day, thousands of men and women workers will receive the communist newspaper Red Flag. Thousands of pamphlets with our ideological-political line, MMC (Mobilize the Masses for Communism) will be distributed among the workers hungry and thirsty for good news. \nWe know that on this May Day, 2013, we will see faces we know of people who are always waiting for the communist news from our party.We\'ll also see other, new faces of those who we hope will receive this news through Red Flag and will appreciate that it is their class brothers and sisters who are developing and building the approach of a communist  society. \n We will bring them news of a system  that benefits  the workers  and won\'t see them die only for the capitalist bosses\' profits. We will say that we need workers to join our International Communist Workers\' Party and develop their revolutionary potential organizing for communist revolution. \n \n Fight to Victory: Workers to power. \n\n\n  \n  SEATTLE MAY DAY DINNER: "YOU CAN\'T STOP THE INTERNATIONAL WORKING CLASS" \n  SEATTLE, WA, April 19 \xe2\x80\x94 "You can\'t take May Day away from the working class!" declared a comrade at the ICWP dinner to prepare for the May Day march. Younger comrades perked up when she told how she first came around the communist movement and her first May Day marches. As a young worker at the telephone company, she was attracted to multiracial groups the communists had built: "Kind of like this dinner." "I was very na\xc3\xafve. I thought all we had to do to make a revolution was fight racism, be militant and not make the same mistakes the old communist party did." She and her family struggled against capitalism for years. She gradually learned that communist ideas were indispensable. "May Day is the only holiday that represents and acknowledges our struggles  throughout  history  and throughout the world. It is especially critical that we continue to expose the reform movements. Capitalism will never be fair. It\'s more corrupt than ever." The comrade described life under communism: no borders, no money, no cops, no bosses. She asked everyone to join us and bring their families and friends on May Day to fight for communism, for a world without chains. \n \n Overcoming Obstacles \n Then the real struggle began among these two dozen or so comrades and friends, to get students to skip school and their parents to encourage this. After all, our aim is communist education for our class, not more capitalist educational competition for individual advancement. Some teachers plan to bring students to the march. Young workers face a particularly hard time getting off work. The capitalist crisis of overproduction has forced them into super-exploitive jobs where time off is an almost-impossible luxury. A new Boeing worker complained that he is forced to work 70-hour weeks, while the company laid off hundreds. \n All vowed to make it to at least part of our activities. \n A neighbor thought she could drop out of the struggle for ten years and come back to exactly the same situation. "Here and in Mexico, we\'re always fighting to reform this system. Things will never change as long as there\'s money," she complained. "Aha!" answered a comrade. "Then let\'s eliminate money and change the material basis of our lives." The neighbor was skeptical because past revolutions kept money. We acknowledged that was a fatal mistake. Socialism kept capitalist relations, enshrined in monetary exchange. We fight directly for communism, where we\'ll produce for our collective needs, not for profits and sale. \n Last year we overcame many obstacles like these. Four thousand people marched last May Day. Our group distributed Red Flag and Mobilize the Masses for Communism to thousands among them. We saw the potential to build a new kind of communist movement. \n \n Bosses\' Media, Cops Declare War on May Day \n We weren\'t the only ones who saw that potential. Seattle newspapers have been running frontpage articles and blistering editorials demanding the cops crack down on May Day demonstrations. The TV and other media are goose-stepping right in line. The old police chief resigned. The new chief vows he won\'t let the May Day "mayhem" happen on his watch. The media aren\'t talking about the epidemic of racist beatings and murders of Seattle workers by cops, or the false assault charges the cops had to drop last May Day after it was determined that they did the assaulting. The cops wanted to crush May Day last year. But they were surrounded by thousands of marchers and had to beat a hasty retreat. This year they are trying to scare people away from participating. \n Reformist leaders are using this fascism as an excuse to take the revolutionary heart out of May Day. One tactic of these treacherous pro-capitalist liberals was waiting until the last minute to publicize the rally and march route. In contrast, our dinner speaker declared: "I wasn\'t sure there would be a mass May Day this year. I was ready to gather my friends together and go downtown and celebrate it anyway." \n Where did this confidence come from? Our conviction that "you can\'t take May Day away from the working class and you can\'t stop the working class from mobilizing the masses for communism."'

It was organised from elements of the Hungarian Working People\'s Party during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution , with J\xc3\xa1nos K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r as general secretary. \n The party initially supported the revolution, but turned against Imre Nagy \'s government after he denounced the Warsaw Pact . The party supported the \' Revolutionary Workers\'-Peasants\' Government of Hungary \' that took over the country, with Soviet support, on 4 November 1956. Gradually, however, the K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r regime instituted goulash Communism , a somewhat more humane way of governing than had prevailed under M\xc3\xa1ty\xc3\xa1s R\xc3\xa1kosi . Under K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r\'s mantra of "he who is not against us is with us," Hungarians generally had more freedom than their Eastern Bloc counterparts to go about their daily lives. The government also gave limited freedom to the workings of the market. While the MSzMP regime was not nearly as repressive as its Warsaw Pact counterparts, at bottom it was still authoritarian. It retained a monopoly of political power, and subjected the media to censorship that was fairly onerous by Western standards. The National Assembly , like its counterparts in the rest of the Soviet bloc, did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the MSzMP. \n K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r retired on 22 May 1988 and was succeeded by Prime Minister K\xc3\xa1roly Gr\xc3\xb3sz . However, Gr\xc3\xb3sz soon found himself eclipsed by a group of radical reformers who favored establishing a market economy. On 28 January 1989, young Politburo member and minister of state Imre Pozsgay announced during an interview with the radio program 168 Hours that the Poliburo`s historical sub-committee regarded the events of 1956 as a \'people\'s uprising\'. This announcement, not approved in advance by the Politburo, provoked and catalyzed various developments within the party, and brought about sudden and ever-escalating changes that led to the ending of Communism in Hungary and the dissolution of the MSzMP. [ 1 ] \n By the summer of 1989, the party\'s radical reformers, led by Prime Minister Miklos Nemeth , Foreign Minister Gyula Horn , Rezs\xc5\x91 Nyers and Pozsgay, had gained control of the party. On 26 June 1989, the Politburo was replaced by a four-man collective presidency chaired by Nyers. Although Gr\xc3\xb3sz remained general secretary, Nyers now outranked him. On 7 October 1989 the MSzMP was dissolved and refounded as the Hungarian Socialist Party , a Western-style social democratic party. A small group of MSzMP members led by Gr\xc3\xb3sz opposed this move, and went on to form the Hungarian Communist Workers\' Party on 17 December 1989. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers\' Party \n \n 1.1 General Secretaries \n 1.2 Chairman of the Presidency of the Political Executive Committee \n \n \n 2 See also \n 3 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Workers\' Party \n [ edit ] General Secretaries \n \n J\xc3\xa1nos K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r 25 October 1956 \xe2\x80\x93 22 May 1988 \n K\xc3\xa1roly Gr\xc3\xb3sz 22 May 1988 \xe2\x80\x93 26 June 1989 (Continued as general secretary until 7 October 1989 but outranked by Rezs\xc5\x91 Nyers the Chairman of the 4-man Presidency of the newly created Political Executive Committee which replaced the Politburo after 26 June 1989) \n \n [ edit ] Chairman of the Presidency of the Political Executive Committee \n \n Rezs\xc5\x91 Nyers 26 June 1989 \xe2\x80\x93 7 October 1989 \n \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Gyula Horn \n Imre Pozsgay \n List of political parties in Hungary \n Mikl\xc3\xb3s N\xc3\xa9meth \n Politics of Hungary \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  http://www.coldwar.hu/html/en/publications/roundtable_kalmar.html \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n Ruling Communist parties in the Eastern Bloc \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Eastern Bloc politics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n &#160;&#160;&#160; \n \n \n \n People\'s Republic of Albania \n \n Party of Labour of Albania \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People\'s Republic of Bulgaria \n \n Bulgarian Communist Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Czechoslovak Socialist Republic \n \n Communist Party of Czechoslovakia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n German Democratic Republic \n \n Socialist Unity Party of Germany \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People\'s Republic of Hungary \n \n Hungarian Socialist Workers\' Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mongolian People\'s Republic \n \n Mongolian People\'s Revolutionary Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People\'s Republic of Poland \n \n Polish United Workers\' Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People\'s Republic of Romania \n \n Romanian Communist Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n \n Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n \n League of Communists of Yugoslavia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n Leaders of the Ruling Parties of Communist Eastern Europe \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n \n \n Vladimir Lenin \n Joseph Stalin \n Nikita Khrushchev \n Leonid Brezhnev \n Yuri Andropov \n Konstantin Chernenko \n Mikhail Gorbachev \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Party of Labour of Albania \n \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Ramiz Alia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Bulgarian Communist Party \n \n \n \n Georgi Dimitrov \n Valko Chervenkov \n Todor Zhivkov \n Petar Mladenov \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communist Party of Czechoslovakia \n \n \n \n Klement Gottwald \n Anton\xc3\xadn Novotny \n Alexander Dub\xc4\x8dek \n Gust\xc3\xa1v Hus\xc3\xa1k \n Milo\xc5\xa1 Jake\xc5\xa1 \n Karel Urb\xc3\xa1nek \n Ladislav Adamec \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Socialist Unity Party of Germany \n \n \n \n Walter Ulbricht \n Erich Honecker \n Egon Krenz \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hungarian Socialist Workers\' Party \n \n \n \n M\xc3\xa1ty\xc3\xa1s R\xc3\xa1kosi \n Ern\xc5\x91 Ger\xc5\x91 \n J\xc3\xa1nos K\xc3\xa1d\xc3\xa1r \n K\xc3\xa1roly Gr\xc3\xb3sz \n Rezs\xc5\x91 Nyers \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Polish United Workers\' Party \n \n \n \n Boles\xc5\x82aw Bierut \n Edward Ochab \n W\xc5\x82adys\xc5\x82aw Gomu\xc5\x82ka \n Edward Gierek \n Stanis\xc5\x82aw Kania \n Wojciech Jaruzelski \n Mieczys\xc5\x82aw Rakowski \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Romanian Communist Party \n \n \n \n Gheorghe Cristescu \n Elek K\xc3\xb6bl\xc3\xb6s \n Vitali Holostenco \n Alexander Danieliuk-Stefanski \n Boris Stefanov \n \xc5\x9etefan Fori\xc5\x9f \n Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej \n Nicolae Ceau\xc8\x99escu \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n League of Communists of Yugoslavia \n \n \n \n Milan Gorki\xc4\x87 \n Josip Broz Tito \n (1980-1990, Rotating Leadership) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n This article about a Hungarian political party is a stub .

[ 1 ]  [ 2 ] \n The term socialist economics may also be applied to analysis of former and existing economic systems that call themselves "socialist", such as the works of Hungarian economist J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai . [ 3 ] \n Socialist economics has been associated with different schools of economic thought, most notably Marxian economics , institutional economics , evolutionary economics and neoclassical economics . Early socialism, like Ricardian socialism , was based on classical economics . During the 20th century, proposals and models for planned economies and market socialism were based heavily on neoclassical economics or a synthesis of neoclassical economics with Marxian or institutional economics. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Description \n \n 1.1 Socialist economic planning \n 1.2 Normative aspects \n 1.3 Economic value in socialism \n 1.4 Socialist economies in theory \n \n \n 2 Socialist economies in practice \n \n 2.1 Centrally planned economies \n \n 2.1.1 Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n 2.1.2 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n 2.1.3 Post-Soviet reforms \n \n \n 2.2 People\'s Republic of China \n 2.3 Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n 2.4 State capitalism \n \n 2.4.1 Singapore \n 2.4.2 India \n \n \n 2.5 Paris Commune \n 2.6 Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n \n 2.6.1 Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n 2.6.2 Self-managed enterprises \n \n \n 2.7 Anarchist Spain \n \n \n 3 History of socialist economic thought \n \n 3.1 Utopian socialism \n 3.2 Socialism and classical political economy \n 3.3 Socialist political economy before Marx \n 3.4 Das Kapital \n 3.5 Anarchist economics \n 3.6 After Marx \n \n \n 4 Criticisms \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n 7 Further reading \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Description \n See also: Socialist mode of production \n \n "I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society." \n \xe2\x80\x94 Albert Einstein , Why Socialism? , 1949 [ 4 ]  \n \n A socialist economy is a system of production where goods and services are produced directly for use , in contrast to a capitalist economic system, where goods and services are produced to generate profit (and therefore indirectly for use). [ 5 ] Goods and services would be produced for their usefulness, or for their use-value, eliminating the need for market-induced needs to ensure a sufficient amount of demand for products to be sold at a profit. Production in a socialist economy is therefore "planned" or "coordinated", and does not suffer from the business cycle inherent to capitalism. In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the factors of production and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market. Karl Marx stated that "lower-stage communism" would consist of compensation based on the amount of labor one contributes to the social product. [ 6 ] \n The ownership of the means of production varies in different socialist theories. It can either be based on public ownership by a state apparatus; direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative ; or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production. \n Management and control over the activities of enterprises is based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximize occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals. [ 7 ] \n However, the economies of the former Socialist states , excluding SFR Yugoslavia, were based on bureaucratic, top-down administration of economic directives and micromanagement of the worker in the workplace inspired by capitalist models of scientific management . As a result, socialists have argued that they were not socialist due to the lack of equal power-relations in the workplace, the presence of a new "elite", and because of the commodity production that took place in these economies. These economic and social systems have been classified as being either Bureaucratic collectivist , State capitalist or Deformed workers\' states , the exact nature of the USSR et al remains unresolved within the socialist movement [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economic planning \n Main article: Economic planning \n Economic planning is a mechanism for the allocation of economic inputs and decision-making based on direct allocation, in contrast to the market mechanism , which is based on indirect allocation. [ 9 ] An economy based on economic planning appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers rather than market transactions involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level. \n Economic planning is not synonymous with the concept of a command economy , which existed in the Soviet Union , and was based on a highly bureaucratic administration of the entire economy in accordance to a comprehensive plan formulated by a central planning agency, which specified output requirements for productive units and tried to micromanage the decisions and policies of enterprises. The command economy is based on the organizational model of a capitalist firm, but applies it to the entire economy. [ 10 ] \n Various advocates of economic planning have been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand the local conditions and rapid changes in the economy. Therefore, central planners would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity because they lacked this informal information. [ 11 ] \n Economic planning in socialism takes a different form than economic planning in capitalist mixed economies (such as Dirigisme , Central banking and Indicative planning ); in the former case planning refers to production of use-value directly (planning of production), while in the latter case planning refers to the planning of capital accumulation in order to stabilize or increase the efficiency of this process. \n [ edit ] Normative aspects \n See also: Socialist critique of capitalism \n The goal of socialist economics is to neutralize capital (or, in the case of market socialism , to subject investment and capital to social planning [ 12 ] ), to coordinate the production of goods and services to directly satisfy demand (as opposed to market-induced needs), and to eliminate the business cycle and crisis of overproduction that occur as a result of an economy based on capital accumulation and private property in the means of production. \n Socialists generally aim to achieve greater equality in decision-making and economic affairs, grant workers greater control of the means of production and their workplace, and to eliminate exploitation by directing the surplus value to employees. Free access to the means of subsistence is a requisite for liberty, because it ensures that all work is voluntary and no class or individual has the power to coerce others into performing alienating work. \n The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labor from alienating work, and therefore freedom from having to perform such labor to receive access to the material necessities for life. It is argued that freedom from necessity would maximize individual liberty, as individuals would be able to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labor for others (the power-elite or ruling class in this case) via mechanisms of social control, such as the labor market and the state. The stage of economic development in which this is possible is contingent upon advances in the productive capabilities of society. This advanced stage of social relations and economic organization is called pure communism . \n [ edit ] Economic value in socialism \n Socialist economic theories base the value of a good or service on its use value , rather than its cost of production ( labor theory of value ) or its exchange value ( Marginal Utility ). [ 13 ] \n Other socialist theories, such as mutualism and market socialism , attempt to apply the labor theory of value to socialism, so that the price of a good or service is adjusted to equal the amount of labor time expended in its production. The labor-time expended by each worker would correspond to labor credits, which would be used as a currency to acquire goods and services. \n Market socialists that base their models on neoclassical economics , and thus marginal utility , such as Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner , have proposed that publicly owned enterprises set their price to equal marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency . \n Anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value and exchange value itself, advocated a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in theory \n Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert identify five economic models within the rubric of socialist economics: [ 15 ] \n \n Public Enterprise Centrally Planned Economy in which all property is owned by the State and all key economic decisions are made centrally by the State, e.g. the former Soviet Union. \n Public Enterprise State-Managed Market Economy , one form of market socialism which attempts to use the price mechanism to increase economic efficiency , while all decisive productive assets remain in the ownership of the state, e.g. socialist market economy in China after reform. \n A mixed economy , where public and private ownership are mixed, and where industrial planning is ultimately subordinate to market allocation, the model generally adopted by social democrats e.g. in twentieth century Sweden. \n Public Enterprise Employee Managed Market Economies , another form of market socialism in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free market exchange of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid twentieth century Yugoslavia, Two more theoretical models are Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar \'s Progressive Utilization Theory and Economic democracy . \n Public Enterprise Participatory Planning , an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. stateless communism , libertarian socialism . An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the Spanish revolution . More developed theoretical models include those of Karl Polanyi , Participatory Economics and the negotiated coordination model of Pat Devine , as well as in Cornelius Castoriadis \'s pamphlet "Workers\' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society". [ 16 ] \n \n Additionally, J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai identifies five distinct classifications for socialism: \n \n Classical / Marxist conception, where socialism is a stage of economic development in which wage labour, private property in the means of production and monetary relations have been made redundant through the development of the productive forces, so that capital accumulation has been superseded by economic planning . Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the "anarchy of production" of capitalism. \n Walrasian / Market Socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative-enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises. \n Leninist conception, which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class, and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning (a "command economy"). \n Social Democratic concept, based on the capitalist mode of production , which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism, and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property; instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state, which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise. \n East Asian model, or socialist market economy , based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader. [ 17 ] \n \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in practice \n Although a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as wage labor , the accumulation of capital , and commodity production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history. \n Various forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 examples of this include cooperative enterprises in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free-software movement based on social peer-to-peer production . \n [ edit ] Centrally planned economies \n A centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with centralised state planning . This model is usually associated with the Soviet-style command economy . In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. The planning process was based around material balances &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the USSR and Eastern bloc economies, this economic model was also utilized by the People\'s Republic of China , Socialist Republic of Vietnam , Republic of Cuba and North Korea . \n [ edit ] Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n Various scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy, and specifically, the Soviet model of economic development, constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the accumulation of capital and the extraction of surplus value from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union (and other Soviet-style economies) were state capitalist economies. [ 18 ] More fundamentally, these economies are still structured around the dynamic of capitalism: the accumulation of capital and production for profit (as opposed to being based on production for use &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the defining criterion for socialism), and have not yet transcended the system of capitalism but are in fact a variation of capitalism based on a process of state-directed accumulation. [ 19 ] \n Other socialist critics point to the lack of socialist social relations in these economies&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 specifically the lack of self-management , a bureaucratic elite based on hierarchical and centralized powers of authority, and the lack of genuine worker control over the means of production&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 leading them to conclude that they were not socialist but either bureaucratic collectivism or state capitalism . [ 20 ]  Trotskyists argue they are neither socialist nor capitalist&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 but are deformed workers\' states . \n This analysis is consistent with Lenin\'s April Theses , which stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism, which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers\' Deputies. Furthermore, these "Communist states" often do not claim to have achieved socialism in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \'s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976, [ 21 ] and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism". [ 22 ] \n This view is challenged by Stalinists and their followers, who claim that socialism was established in the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin came to power and instituted the system of five year plans. Joseph Stalin introduced the theory of Socialism in one country , which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. \n [ edit ] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n Main article: Economy of the Soviet Union \n See also: Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union) , Gosplan ,&#160;and Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union \n The Soviet Union and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally planned economy . They dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production. Workers were still, however, effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers\' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx\'s views of historical materialism , and his views of the process of socialization. \n The characteristics of this model of economy were: \n \n Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers. Critics [ who? ] of both left and right persuasions have argued that the economy was plagued by incentive-related problems; [ citation needed ] claiming, for instance, that the system incentivized enterprise managers to underreport their unit\'s productive capacities so that their quotas would be easier to achieve, especially since the manager\'s bonuses were linked to the fulfillment of quotas. \n \n \n Allocation through political control . In contrast with systems where prices determined allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so after the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place. \n Full employment . Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan. \n Clearing goods by planning : if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use. \n Five Year Plans for the long-term development of key industries. \n \n [ edit ] Post-Soviet reforms \n After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, many of the remaining socialist states presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. \n The Republic of Cuba , under the leadership of Raul Castro , has begun to encourage co-operatives and self-employment in a move to reduce the central role of state enterprise and state management over the economy, with the goal of building a co-operative form of socialism. [ 23 ] \n Vietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the socialist-oriented market economy . This economic system is a form of mixed-economy consisting of state, private, co-operative and individual enterprises coordinated by the market mechanism . This system is intended to be transitional stage in the development of socialism. \n [ edit ] People\'s Republic of China \n Main article: Economy of the People\'s Republic of China \n China embraced a socialist planned economy after the Communist victory in its Civil War. Private property and private ownership of capital were abolished, and various forms of wealth made subject to state control or to workers\' councils. \n The Chinese economy broadly adopted a similar system of production quotas and full employment by fiat to the Russian model. The Great Leap Forward saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture, and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected, (e.g., there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after three years. \n In recent decades China has opened its economy to foreign investment and to market-based trade, and has continued to experience strong economic growth. It has carefully managed the transition from a planned socialist economy to a market economy, officially referred to as the socialist commodity market economy , which has been likened to capitalism by some outside observers. [ 24 ] As a result, centralized economic planning has little relevance in China today. \n The current Chinese economic system is characterized by state ownership combined with a strong private sector that privately owned enterprises that generate about 33% [ 25 ] (People\'s Daily Online 2005) to over 50% of GDP in 2005, [ 26 ] with a BusinessWeek article estimating 70% [ 27 ] of GDP, a figure that might be even greater considering the Chengbao system . Some western observers note that the private sector is likely underestimated by state officials in calculation of GDP due to its propensity to ignore small private enterprises that are not registered. [ 28 ] Most of the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, which is left to the management of both state and private firms. A significant amount of privately owned firms exist, especially in the consumer service sector. [ 29 ] \n The state sector is concentrated in the \'commanding heights\' of the economy with a growing private sector engaged primarily in commodity production and light industry. Centralized directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and production quotas has been superseded by the free-market mechanism for most of the economy and directive planning is utilized in some large state industries. [ 29 ] A major difference from the old planned economy is the privatization of state institutions. 150 state-owned enterprises remain and report directly to the central government, most having a number of subsidiaries. [ 30 ] By 2008, these state-owned corporations have became increasingly dynamic largely contributing to the increase in revenue for the state. [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] The state-sector led the economic recovery process and increased economic growth in 2009 after the financial crises. [ 33 ] \n This type of economic system is defended from a Marxist perspective which states that a socialist planned economy can only be possible after first establishing the necessary comprehensive commodity market economy, letting it fully develop until it exhausts its historical stage and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy. [ 34 ] Proponents of this model distinguish themselves from market socialists who believe that economic planning is unattainable, undesirable or ineffective at distributing goods, viewing the market as the solution rather than a temporary phase in development of a socialist planned economy. \n The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has pursued similar economic reforms, though less extensive, which have resulted in what is officially called a Socialist-oriented market economy , a mixed economy where the state plays a dominant role intended to be a transitional phase in establishment of a socialist economy. [ 35 ] \n [ edit ] Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n Main article: Social democracy \n Many of the industrialized, open countries of Western Europe experimented with one form of social democratic mixed economies or another during the 20th century. These include Britain (mixed economy and welfare state) from 1945 to 1979, France (state capitalism and indicative planning) from 1945 to 1982 under dirigisme, Sweden (social democratic welfare state) and Norway (state capitalist mixed economy) to the present. They can be regarded as social democratic experiments, because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production. \n Nevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a purely private capitalist model. Variations range from social democratic welfare states , such as in Sweden, to mixed economies where a major percentage of GDP comes from the state sector, such as in Norway, which ranks among the highest countries in quality of life and equality of opportunity for its citizens. [ 36 ] Elements of these efforts persist throughout Europe, even if they have repealed some aspects of public control and ownership. They are typically characterized by: \n \n Nationalization of key industries, such as mining, oil, steel, energy and transportation. A common model is for a sector to be taken over by the state and then one or more publicly owned corporations set up for its day-to-day running. Advantages of nationalization include: the ability of the state to direct investment in key industries, the distribution of state profits from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals, greater control of the industries by and for the workers, and the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace. \n Redistribution of wealth , through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of progressive taxation regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common. \n Social security schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and parental leave. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities. \n Minimum wages , employment protection and trade union recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce full employment . There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged strikes rather than negotiation. \n National planning for industrial development. \n Demand management in a Keynesian fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment. \n \n [ edit ] State capitalism \n Various state capitalist economies, which consist of large commercial state enterprises that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, have evolved in countries that have been influenced by various elected socialist political parties and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism, and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology. \n [ edit ] Singapore \n Main article: Economy of Singapore \n Singapore pursued a state-led model of economic development under the People\'s Action Party , which initially adopted a Leninist approach to politics and a broad socialist model of economic development. [ 37 ] The PAP was initially a member of the Socialist International . Singapore\'s economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises and government-linked companies through Temasek Holdings , which generate 60% of Singapore\'s GDP. [ 38 ] \n The state also provides substantial public housing, free education, health and recreational services, as well as comprehensive public transportation. [ 39 ] Today Singapore is often characterized as having a state capitalist economy that combines economic planning with the free-market. [ 40 ] While government-linked companies generate a majority of Singapore\'s GDP, moderate state planning in the economy has been reduced in recent decades. \n [ edit ] India \n Main article: Economy of India \n After gaining independence from Britain, India adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a mixed economy , it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the USSR or China. Today India is often characterized as having a free-market economy that combines economic planning with the free-market . It did however adopt a very firm focus on national planning with a series of broad Five-Year Plans . \n [ edit ] Paris Commune \n Main article: Paris Commune \n The Paris Commune was considered to be a prototype mode of economic and political organization for a future socialist society by Karl Marx. Private property in the means of production was abolished so that individuals and co-operative associations of producers owned productive property and introduced democratic measures where elected officials received no more in compensation than the average worker and could be recalled at any time. [ 41 ] \n [ edit ] Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n Various forms of socialist organization based on co-operative decision making, workplace democracy and in some cases, production directly for use , have existed within the broader context of the capitalist mode of production since the Paris Commune. New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making. \n Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. [ 42 ] \n Commons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 software is produced solely for their use-value . \n Wikipedia , being based on collaboration and cooperation and a freely associated individuals , has been cited as a template for how socialism might operate. [ 43 ] This is a modern example of what the Paris Commune&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 a template for possible future organization&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 was to Marx in his time. \n [ edit ] Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n Main article: Economy of SFR Yugoslavia \n Yugoslavia pursued a socialist economy based on autogestion or worker-self management. Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were socially owned rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to Edvard Kardelj \'s theory of associated labor. \n [ edit ] Self-managed enterprises \n See also: Cooperative \n The Mondragon Corporation , a federation of cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management, which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures, have been adopted by various private corporations such as Cisco Systems , inc. [ 44 ] But unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership. More fundamentally, employee-owned, self-managed enterprises still operate within the broader context of capitalism and are subject to the accumulation of capital and profit-loss mechanism. \n [ edit ] Anarchist Spain \n Main article: Spanish revolution \n See also: Anarcho-syndicalism \n The Spanish Revolution was a workers\' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain\'s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers. Sam Dolgoff estimated that over 10 million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." \n [ edit ] History of socialist economic thought \n Main article: History of socialism \n Values of socialism have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations, and communal charity of Mediaeval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations. [ 45 ] As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in Enlightenment doctrine such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau \'s Discourse on Inequality , Wilhelm von Humboldt \'s Limits of State Action , or Immanuel Kant \'s insistent defense of the French Revolution . [ 46 ] \n Capitalism appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 land, elaborate machinery, and labour&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 and these imperatives led to the commodification of these elements. [ 47 ] \n According to influential socialist economic historian Karl Polanyi \'s classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre-existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of "primitive accumulation" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter-movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society. These counter-movements, that included, for example, the Luddite rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory. \n As Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market\'s worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively "exploitative", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity. \n Within this context socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s-1850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and Communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830\xe2\x80\x931916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the Soviet Union , and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916\xe2\x80\x931989); and the response of socialism in the neo-liberal era (1990- ). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics. \n [ edit ] Utopian socialism \n Main article: Utopian socialism \n The first theories which came to hold the term "socialism" began to be formulated in the late 18th century, and were termed "socialism" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters, or "capitalists" as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages. (See Iron law of wages ). \n Socialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the Shakers in America. \n Utopian socialism had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems. \n [ edit ] Socialism and classical political economy \n The first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in Adam Smith , Robert Malthus and David Ricardo . In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a class analysis , a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being unproductive . Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a " general glut ", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war. \n [ edit ] Socialist political economy before Marx \n \n \n \n  \n Charles Fourier , influential early French socialist thinker \n \n \n A key early socialist theorist of political economy was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . He was the most well-known of nineteenth century mutualist theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: Technocrats like Henri de Saint Simon, agrarian radicals like Thomas Spence , William Ogilvie and William Cobbett ; anti-capitalists like Thomas Hodgskin ; communitarian and utopian socialists like Robert Owen , William Thompson and Charles Fourier ; anti-market socialists like John Gray and John Francis Bray ; the Christian mutualist William Batchelder Greene ; as well as the theorists of the Chartist movement and early proponents of syndicalism . [ 48 ] \n The first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon was the first individual to coin the term "socialism". [ 49 ] Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology, which led him to advocate a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and which would be based upon equal opportunities. [ 50 ] Simon advocated a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. [ 49 ] This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organized economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, which embodied a desire for a semi- planned economy . [ 49 ] \n Other early socialist thinkers were influenced by the classical economists. The Ricardian socialists , such as Thomas Hodgskin and Charles Hall, were based on the work of David Ricardo and reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. [ 51 ] \n [ edit ] Das Kapital \n Main article: Das Kapital \n Karl Marx employed systematic analysis in an ambitious attempt to elucidate capitalism\'s contradictory laws of motion, as well as to expose the specific mechanisms by which it exploits and alienates. He radically modified classical political economic theories. Notably, the labor theory of value that had been worked upon by Adam Smith and David Ricardo , was transformed into his characteristic " law of value " and used for the purpose of revealing how commodity fetishism obscures the reality of capitalist society. \n His approach, which Engels would call " scientific socialism ", would stand as the branching point in economic theory: in one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.". [ 52 ] \n Das Kapital is one of the many famous incomplete works of economic theory: Marx had planned four volumes, completed two, and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways the work is modelled on Adam Smith\'s Wealth of Nations , seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption and finance in relation to morality and the state. \n It is a work of philosophy, anthropology and sociology as much as one of economics. However, it has several important statements: \n \n The Law of Value Capitalist production is the production of \xe2\x80\x9can immense multitude of commodities\xe2\x80\x9d or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \xe2\x80\x9cis independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] But rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker\'s wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments. \n \n \n Historical Property Relations Historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the means of production by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban proletariat based on the institution of wage-labour . Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the metabolic rift between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas. [ 54 ] \n Commodity Fetishism Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. "Commodity fetishism" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation. \n Economic Exploitation Workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the surplus value created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists. \n Accumulation Inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist\'s social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money--&gt;Commodity--&gt;Money\', where the capitalist receives an increment or "surplus value" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale. \n Crises Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism\'s inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few. \n Centralization The interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital. \n Material Development As a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the productivity of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure. \n Socialization, and the pre-conditions for Revolution By socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program. [ 55 ] \n \n [ edit ] Anarchist economics \n Main article: Anarchist economics \n Anarchist economics is the set of theories and practices of economics and economic activity within the political philosophy of anarchism . \n Pierre Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings . [ 56 ]  Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought that originates in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production , either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market . [ 57 ] Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. [ 58 ] Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". [ 59 ] Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or usury . \n \n \n \n  \n The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin , influential work which presents the economic vision of anarcho-communism \n \n \n Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary [ 60 ] doctrine that advocates the abolition of the state and private ownership of the means of production . Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. Once collectivization takes place, workers \' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market. [ 61 ] Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin , the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International , and the early Spanish anarchist movement . \n Anarchist communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state , private property , and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production , [ 62 ]  [ 63 ]  direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to ability, to each according to need". [ 64 ]  [ 65 ] Unlike mutualism, collectivist anarchism and marxism, anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value altogether, instead advocating a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Carlo Cafiero , Emilio Covelli , Errico Malatesta , Andrea Costa and other ex- Mazzinian Republicans. [ 66 ] Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin , they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin\'s death. [ 67 ] By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism . \n [ edit ] After Marx \n Marx\'s work sharpened the existing differences between the revolutionary and non-revolutionary socialists. [ citation needed ] \n Non-revolutionary socialists took inspiration from the work of John Stuart Mill , and later John Maynard Keynes and the Keynesians , who provided theoretical justification for (potentially very extensive) state involvement in an existing market economy. [ citation needed ] According to the Keynesians, if the business cycle could be solved by national ownership of key industries and state direction of their investment, class antagonism would be effectively tamed; a compact would be formed between labour and the capitalists. There would be no need for revolution; instead Keynes looked to the eventual "euthanasia of the rentier" sometime in the far future. [ citation needed ] Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki employed Keynesian insights to form the basis of a critical post-Keynesian economics that at times went well beyond liberal reformism. Many original socialist economic ideas would also emerge out of the trade union movement [ citation needed ] (see Guild Socialism ). \n In the wake of Marx, "Marxist" economists developed many different, sometimes contradictory tendencies. [ citation needed ] Some of these tendencies were based on internal disputes about the meaning of some of Marx\'s ideas, including the \'Law of Value\' and his crisis theory. [ citation needed ] Other variations were elaborations that subsequent theorists made in light of real world developments. [ citation needed ] For example the monopoly capitalist school saw Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy attempt to modify Marx\'s theory of capitalist development, which was based upon the assumption of price competition, to reflect the evolution to a stage where both economy and state were subject to the dominating influence of giant corporations. World-systems analysis , would restate Marx\'s ideas about the worldwide division of labour and the drive to accumulate from the holistic perspective of capitalism\'s historical development as a global system. [ citation needed ] \n Accordingly, Immanuel Wallerstein , writing in 1979, maintained that "There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world-system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form. Socialism involves the creation of a new kind of world-system, neither a redistributive world-empire nor a capitalist world-economy but a socialist world-government. I don\'t see this projection as being in the least utopian but I also don\'t feel its institution is imminent. It will be the outcome of a long social struggle in forms that may be familiar and perhaps in very few forms, that will take place in all the areas of the world-economy." [ 68 ] \n Meanwhile other notable strands of reformist and revolutionary socialist economics sprung up that were either only loosely associated with Marxism or wholly independent. Thorsten Veblen is widely credited as the founder of critical institutionalism . His idiosyncratic theorizing included acidic critiques of the inefficiency of capitalism, monopolies, advertising, and the utility of conspicuous consumption . Some institutionalists have addressed the incentive problems experienced by the Soviet Union. Critical institutionalists have worked on the specification of incentive-compatible institutions, usually based on forms of participatory democracy, as a resolution superior to allocation by an autonomous market mechanism. [ citation needed ] \n Another key socialist, closely related to Marx, Keynes, and Gramsci , was Piero Sraffa . [ citation needed ] He mined classical political economy, particularly Ricardo, in an attempt to erect a value theory that was at the same time an explanation of the normal distribution of prices in an economy, as well that of income and economic growth. A key finding was that the net product or surplus in the sphere of production was determined by the balance of bargaining power between workers and capitalists, which was in turn subject to the influence of non-economic, presumably social and political factors. The mutualist tradition associated with Proudhon also continued, influencing the development of libertarian socialism , anarchist communism , syndicalism and distributivism . [ citation needed ] \n In the real world, revolutionary socialists were confronted by the necessity of running an economy, and generally a war economy , and developed ideas and practice in response to the situations they found themselves in. [ citation needed ] \n [ edit ] Criticisms \n Main article: Criticism of socialism \n Criticism of socialist economics comes from market economists, including the classicals, neoclassicals and Austrians, as well as from some anarchist economists. Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist, and market socialist economists, for example, criticize centralized economic planning and propose participatory economics and decentralized socialism. \n Market economists generally criticise socialism for eliminating the free market and its price signals, which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes lack of incentive. They believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP. \n Austrian school economists, such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises , have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the means of production would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market, it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the economic calculation problem . Polish economist Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner rebutted Mises\' argument by developing the Lange Model during the Economic calculation debate . The Lange model states that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition, in that it achieves Pareto efficiency. \n The neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian school argued, as it is the motivation to act on information.

There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology...It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality." \n ^  Socialism and Calculation , on worldsocialism.org.

Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness.

The International intended to fight "by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State." [ 1 ] \n The Comintern was founded after the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference [ clarification needed ] in which Vladimir Lenin had organized the " Zimmerwald Left " against those who refused to approve any statement explicitly endorsing socialist revolutionary action, and after the 1916 dissolution of the Second International . \n The Comintern had seven World Congresses between 1919 and 1935. It also had thirteen "Enlarged Plenums" of its governing Executive Committee , which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses. The Comintern was officially dissolved by Joseph Stalin during 1943. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Organizational history \n \n 1.1 Failure of the Second International \n 1.2 Impact of the Russian Revolution \n 1.3 Founding Congress \n 1.4 Second World Congress \n 1.5 Third World Congress \n 1.6 Fifth to Seventh World Congresses \n \n 1.6.1 The Second Period \n 1.6.2 The Third Period \n \n \n 1.7 Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front \n 1.8 Dissolution \n 1.9 Successor organisations \n \n \n 2 Comintern and Communist Party of China \n \n 2.1 1921 to 1927 \n 2.2 1927 to 1935 \n 2.3 1935 to 1942 \n \n \n 3 Comintern-sponsored international organisations \n 4 World congresses and plenums of Comintern \n 5 See also \n 6 Footnotes \n 7 Further reading \n \n 7.1 Primary sources \n \n \n 8 External links \n \n \n \n \n Organizational history \n Failure of the Second International \n \n \n \n  \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources .

(March 2011)  \n \n \n While the differences had been evident for decades, World War I proved the issue that finally divided the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers\' movement . The socialist movement had been historically antimilitarist and internationalist , and therefore opposed workers serving as "cannon fodder" for the "bourgeois" governments at war. This especially since the Triple Alliance (1882) comprised two empires, while the Triple Entente gathered the French Third Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland into an alliance with the Russian Empire . The Communist Manifesto had stated that "the working class has no country " and exclaimed " Proletarians of all countries, unite! " Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it was declared. \n Nevertheless, within hours of the declarations of war, almost all the socialist parties of the combatant states announced their support for their own respective countries. The only exceptions were the socialist parties of the Balkans , Russia , and tiny minorities in other countries. To Lenin\'s surprise, even the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) voted in favor of war credits. The assassination of French socialist Jean Jaur\xc3\xa8s on July 31, 1914 killed the last hope of peace by removing one of the few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international socialist movement to prevent it from segmenting itself along national lines and supporting governments of National Unity . \n Socialist parties of neutral countries for the most part continued to argue for neutrality rather than for total opposition to the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference , Lenin organized opposition to the " imperialist war" into a movement that became known as the "Zimmerwald Left" and published the pamphlet Socialism and War , in which he called all socialists who collaborated with their national governments " social-chauvinists ", that is, socialists in word but chauvinists in deed. \n The International was dividing into a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a center group wavering between those poles. Lenin condemned much of the center as social-pacifists for several reasons, but partly because while they opposed the war they refused to break party discipline and voted for war credits. The term "social-pacifist" aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald , leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain , who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism but did not actively resist it. \n Discredited by its passivity towards world events, the Second International dissolved in the middle of the war in 1916. In 1917 Lenin published the April Theses , which openly supported a " revolutionary defeatism ": the Bolsheviks pronounced themselves in favor of the defeat of Russia which would permit them to move directly to the stage of a revolutionary insurrection . \n Impact of the Russian Revolution \n The victory of the Russian Communist Party in the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was felt throughout the world. An alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of the Great War, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin , believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism, just as the Paris Commune had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. To this end, the organization of a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world became to the Bolsheviks a necessity. \n Founding Congress \n Main article: Founding Congress of the Comintern \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Core tenets \n \n \n \n Communism \n Vanguard party \n Democratic centralism \n Central planning \n Proletarian internationalism \n Marxist\xe2\x80\x92Leninist atheism \n Single-party state \n Socialist patriotism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Topics \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n Stalinism \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Khrushchevism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Vladimir Lenin \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n Ernst Th\xc3\xa4lmann \n \n \n Earl Browder \n \n \n Gonchigiin Bumtsend \n \n \n Josip Broz Tito \n Fidel Castro \n \n \n Che Guevara \n Mao Zedong \n \n \n Deng Xiaoping \n Ho Chi Minh \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Mathieu K\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9kou \n \n \n Agostinho Neto \n Samora Machel \n \n \n Thomas Sankara \n Alfonso Cano \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Literature \n \n \n \n Wage Labour and Capital \n Materialism and Empirio-criticism \n Imperialism &#160;&#160; (Lenin) \n What Is to Be Done? \n The State and Revolution \n \n Dialectical and \nHistorical Materialism \n \n On Contradiction \n Guerrilla Warfare \n \n Fundamentals of \nMarxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History \n \n \n \n Great October Socialist Revolution \n \n \n Soviet Union \n Comintern \n \n \n Hungarian Soviet Republic \n \n \n Spanish Civil War \n World War II \n \n \n Warsaw Pact \n Greek Civil War \n \n \n Chinese Revolution \n \n \n Korean War \n Cuban Revolution \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n \n \n Non-Aligned Movement \n \n \n Sino-Soviet split \n Vietnam War \n \n \n Portuguese Colonial War \n \n \n Nicaraguan Revolution \n \n \n Nepalese Civil War \n \n \n Naxalite-Maoist insurgency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Bolshevism \n Leninism \n \n \n Maoism \n Marxism \n \n \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Titoism \n Trotskyism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communism portal \n Politics portal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n The Comintern was founded in these conditions at a Congress held in Moscow March 2\xe2\x80\x936, 1919, [ 2 ] against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War . There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties. [ 3 ] They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, Trotsky and Christian Rakovsky later delegated the task of managing the International to Grigory Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff , acting as the secretary of the International, Victor L. Kibaltchitch [ 4 ] and Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin . [ 5 ] Lenin, Trotsky and Alexandra Kollontai presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between " bourgeois democracy " and the " dictatorship of the proletariat ". [ 6 ] \n The following parties and movements were invited to the Founding Congress: \n \n  Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) \n  Spartacus League ( Germany ) \n  Communist Party of German Austria \n  Hungarian Communist Workers\' Party , in power during B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s  Hungarian Soviet Republic \n  Communist Party of Finland \n  Communist Party of Poland \n  Communist Party of Estonia \n  Communist Party of Latvia \n  Lithuanian CP \n  Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Byelorussia \n  Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (Ukrainian section of Russian CP, same party basically) \n  The revolutionary elements of the Czech social democracy \n  Social Democratic and Labour Party of Bulgaria ( Tesnyatsi ) \n  Romanian Social Democratic Party \n  Left-wing of the Serbian SDP \n  Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden \n  The Norwegian Labour Party \n  For Denmark , the Klassekampen group \n  Communist Party of the Netherlands \n  Revolutionary elements of the Belgian Labour Party (who would create the Communist Party of Belgium in 1921) \n  Groups and organisations within the French socialist and syndicalist movements \n  Left wing within the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland \n  Italian Socialist Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Spanish Socialist Workers\' Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Portuguese Socialist Party \n  British socialist parties (particularly the current represented by John Maclean ) \n  Socialist Labour Party (Great Britain) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (Great Britain) \n  Revolutionary elements of the workers\' organisations of Ireland \n  Revolutionary elements among the Shop stewards (Great Britain) \n  Socialist Labor Party of the United States \n  Left elements of the Socialist Party of America (the tendency represented by Eugene Debs and the Socialist Propaganda League of America ) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (United States) \n  Industrial Workers of the World ( Australia ) \n  Workers\' International Industrial Union (United States) \n  The Socialist groups of Tokyo and Yokohama ( Japan , represented by Sen Katayama ) \n Socialist Youth International (represented by Willi M\xc3\xbcnzenberg ) [ 7 ] \n \n Of these, the following attended: the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, the Volga German region; the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (the opposition), Balkan Revolutionary People\'s of Russia; Zimmerwald Left Wing of France; the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French and Swiss Communist Groups; the Dutch Social-Democratic Group; Socialist Propaganda League and the Socialist Labor Party of America; Socialist Workers\' Party of China; Korean Workers\' Union, Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijanian and Persian Sections of the Central Bureau of the Eastern People\'s, and the Zimmerwald Commission. [ 3 ]  [ 8 ] \n Grigory Zinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern\'s Executive Committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in What Is to Be Done? (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin\'s leadership was that Communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international proletarian revolution . The parties also shared his principle of democratic centralism , "freedom of discussion, unity of action", that is, that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made. [ 9 ] In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the " General Staff of the World Revolution ." [ 10 ] \n Second World Congress \n \n Main article: 2nd World Congress of the Comintern . \n \n \n \n \n  \nSecond Congress of the Communist International. 1920. \n \n \n Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. The Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between Communist parties and other socialist groups, [ 11 ] and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organisations along democratic centralist lines, in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership. \n Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the second congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M.N. Roy , who attended as a delegate of the Communist Party of Mexico . The congress removed the term \xe2\x80\x98bourgeois-democratic\' in what became the 8th condition. [ 12 ] \n Many European socialist parties went through splits on the basis of the adhesion or not to the new International. The French Section of the Workers International (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 Tours Congress , leading to the creation of the new French Communist Party (initially called "French Section of the Communist International" - SFIC); the Communist Party of Spain was created in 1920, the Communist Party of Italy was created in 1921, the Belgian Communist Party in September 1921, etc. \n Third World Congress \n Writings from the Third Congress, held in June\xe2\x80\x93July 1921, talked about how the struggle could be transformed into "civil war" when the circumstances were favorable and "openly revolutionary uprisings". [ 13 ] The Fourth Congress, November 1922, at which Leon Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein. [ 14 ] \n The Dungan commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, Magaza Masanchi , attended the Third Congress. [ 15 ] \n During this early period, known as the "First Period" in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik revolution under attack in the Russian Civil War and a wave of revolutions across Europe , the Comintern\'s priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some Communist Parties had secret military wings. On example is the M-Apparat of the Communist Party of Germany . Its purpose was to prepare for the civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany, and to liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party. There was also a paramilitary organization, the Rotfrontk\xc3\xa4mpferbund . [ 16 ] \n The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader, B\xc3\xa9la Kun . Soon an official "Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government" was formed, unofficially known as " Lenin Boys ". [ 17 ] The next attempt was the " March Action " in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former Chairman, Paul Levi , from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet, [ 18 ] which was ratified by the ECCI prior to the 3rd congress. [ 19 ] A new attempt was made at the time of the Ruhr Crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200-300 Communists attacked police stations but were quickly defeated. [ 20 ] In 1924 there was a failed coup in Estonia by the Estonian Communist Party . [ 21 ] \n In 1924, the Mongolian People\'s Revolutionary Party joined Comintern. [ 22 ] At first, in China both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were supported. After the definite break with Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Stalin sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed. [ 23 ] \n Fifth to Seventh World Congresses \n The Second Period \n \n \n \n  \nThe Comintern membership card of Karl Kilbom \n \n \n Lenin died in 1924. 1925 signalled a shift from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that year, Joseph Stalin upheld the thesis of " socialism in one country ", detailed by Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat? (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin\'s January 1926 article On the Issues of Leninism . The perspective of a world revolution was dismissed after the failures of the Spartacist uprising in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the reflux of all revolutionary movements in Europe, such as in Italy , where the fascist squadristi broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following the 1922 March on Rome ). This period, up to 1928, was known as the "Second Period", mirroring the shift in the USSR from war communism to the New Economic Policy . [ 24 ] \n At the 5th World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned Marxist philosopher Georg Luk\xc3\xa1cs \'s History and Class Consciousness , published in 1923 after his involvement in B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s Hungarian Soviet Republic , and Karl Korsch \'s Marxism and Philosophy . [ citation needed ] Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin, who already held considerable power by this time. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years, until 1928 when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution. \n Geoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: \n \n By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924... the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of "Bolshevization" was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of "internal rectification" began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928. [ 25 ] \n \n The Third Period \n In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee began the so-called " Third Period ", which was to last until 1935. [ 26 ] The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse, and that as such, the correct stance for all Communist parties was that of a highly aggressive, militant, ultra-left line. In particular, the Comintern described all moderate left-wing parties as " social fascists ", and urged the Communists devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. With the rise of the Nazi movement in Germany after 1930, this stance became somewhat controversial with many, such as the Polish Communist historian Isaac Deutscher , criticizing the tactics of the Communist Party of Germany of treating the Social Democratic Party of Germany as the principal enemy. [ citation needed ] \n The 6th World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The congress did however make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally but not a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian Communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists. [ 27 ] \n Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front \n The seventh and last congress of the Comintern was held between July 25 and August 20, 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti , Wilhelm Pieck and Dmitry Manuilsky . [ 28 ] The congress officially endorsed the Popular Front against fascism. This policy argued that Communist Parties should seek to form a Popular Front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a United Front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern; in France and Spain in particular, it would have momentous consequences with L\xc3\xa9on Blum \'s 1936 election, which led to the Popular Front government . \n Stalin\'s purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the USSR and overseas. At Stalin\'s direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser , using the pseudonym \'Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin\', was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later, the NKVD ). At Stalin\'s orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge . Several hundred German Communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated, and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany. [ 29 ]  Fritz Platten died in a labor camp; the leaders of the Indian ( Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish Communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. A great number of German Communists were handed over to Adolf Hitler . Leopold Trepper recalled these days: "In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o\'clock in the morning.... Exactly 3 o\'clock the car lights began to be seen... we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped." [ 30 ] \n Dissolution \n At the start of World War II , the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention , arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, much like World War I had been. But when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the Allies . On May 15, 1943, a declaration of the Executive Committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of Comintern. The declaration read: \n \n The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers\' parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.... But long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles. \n \n Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: \n \n To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International. \n \n After endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved. [ 31 ] Messages between Tito and Dimitrov the Secretary-General in Moscow were intercepted and decrypted by the British GC&amp;CS ( Bletchley Park ) from 1943, though the volume of messages was not great (the first message from "Walter" [Tito] was intercepted on 21 April, though not decrypted until many months later). They showed the level of control exercised over him (Tito) by Moscow and continued with Dimitrov after June 1943, when the Comintern itself was dissolved. [ 32 ] \n Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill ) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries. [ 33 ] \n Successor organisations \n The International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown. [ 34 ] \n In September 1947, following the June 1947 Paris Conference on Marshall Aid , Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties and set up the Cominform , or Communist Information Bureau , often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the Communist parties of Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , France , Hungary , Italy , Poland , Romania , the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia (led by Josip Broz Tito , it was expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956, following Stalin\'s 1953 death and the XXth Congress of the CPSU . \n While the Communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after dissolution of Comintern, periodical meetings of Communist parties were held in Moscow . Moreover World Marxist Review , a joint periodical of the Communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Socialist Bloc in 1989-1991. \n Comintern and Communist Party of China \n The complicated relationship between the Comintern and the Communist Party of China (CPC) is an important chapter in the history of Comintern. \n 1921 to 1927 \n The CPC was established in 1921 with the help of the Comintern. The CPC declared itself to be a branch of the Comintern. At that time, China had a large revolutionary party called the Chinese Nationalist Party ( Kuomintang ). Its leader, Dr. Sun Yatsen , frustrated by the refusal of aid for China from the democratic Western countries, quickly turned to the Soviet Union and the Comintern. Under the instruction of the Comintern, [ citation needed ] the CPC joined the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang also applied for membership in the Comintern, but was not accepted since it was essentially considered to be an anti-colonialist bourgeois political party and not a true Marxist vehicle. Sun Yatsen\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Chiang Kai-shek , was once elected as an honorary member of the standing committee of the Comintern. [ citation needed ] \n The Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Joseph Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin followed a practical policy, ignoring communist ideology. He told the Chinese Communist Party to stop whining about the lower classes and follow the Kuomintang \'s orders. Stalin, like Vladimir Lenin , believed that the KMT bourgeoisie would defeat the western imperialists in China and complete the revolution. Trotsky wanted the Communist party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and opposed the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. [ 35 ] Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang\'s right wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 1927 by massacring the Communist party in Shanghai midway in the Northern Expedition. [ 36 ]  [ 37 ] \n 1927 to 1935 \n After the success of the joint revolution of the Kuomintang and CPC in reuniting China under a single government, they split over their ideological differences. The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek ultimately became an anti-Communist force. The Comintern instructed the Communists to initiate urban riots, but all failed. [ citation needed ] A group of \xe2\x80\x9cnative Communists\xe2\x80\x9d, such as Mao Zedong , used peasant riots to establish the Soviet Republic of China in remote mountain villages. The Comintern sent a German Communist, Otto Braun , as the CPC\'s military adviser, who became the CPC\'s de facto military commander later. [ citation needed ] Zhou Enlai , once the Comintern\'s favorite, [ citation needed ] was the chairman of the Military Committee of the CPC. After being besieged by Chiang Kai-shek\xe2\x80\x99s Nationalist army, the Chinese Red Army had to escape to try to find a new base - this came to be known as the Long March (1934\xe2\x80\x931935). \n 1935 to 1942 \n During the Long March, the CPC party leadership re-examined its policy in Zunyi (January 1935). Mao Zedong blamed the CPC\'s failure to ignite a revolution on their decision to blindly follow the Comintern\'s instructions, which did not take into account the reality of Chinese conditions. During the heated debate, Zhou Enlai unexpectedly accepted the criticism and sided with Mao. Otto Braun was dismissed from his position as the CPC\'s military commander. \n After they resettled in Yanan , the native Chinese Communists, such as Mao and Zhu De , became the real powers in the CPC rather than the foreign Communists supplied by the Comintern. Those Chinese Communists who were loyal to the Comintern, such as a group called the 28 Bolsheviks , fell from all of the most important positions within the CPC. Zhou Enlai became an assistant to Mao in political affairs, such as the pursuit of the United Front and diplomacy. By this time, the Comintern and the Soviet Union could no longer control the CPC. The Comintern continued to give advice, but much of it was simply ignored. The CPC was now a truly Chinese entity, much as the Bolshevik Party had been a truly Russian one. \n An exception to this rule was the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army , organized by the Manchuria branch of the CPC in 1932. Geographically separated from the CPC headquarters in Yenan , this guerrilla army did not report directly to the CPC center, but was still led and supported by the Soviet Union under the guise of the Comintern until it was defeated by a Japanese occupation force and fled to the Soviet Union in 1942. \n Comintern-sponsored international organisations \n Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period: \n \n Communist Youth International (1919\xe2\x80\x931943) \n Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern - formed 1920) \n Communist Women\'s International (formed 1920) \n International Red Aid (MOPR - formed 1922) \n Red Peasant International (Krestintern - formed 1923) \n Red Sports International (Sportintern) \n International of the Proletarian Freethinkers (1925\xe2\x80\x931933) \n League against Imperialism (formed 1927) \n \n World congresses and plenums of Comintern \n Delegate figures are voting plus consultative.

The term "purge" has taken on very negative connotations, because of the Great Purge of the 1930s. In the early 1920s, however, the term was more ambiguous. See J. Arch Getty Origins of the Great Purges: The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered, 1933-1938 p.41 for discussion of the ambiguities in the term, including its use in the 1920 Comintern resolution. \n ^  M.V.S.

[ 1 ] "Social ownership" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership , state ownership , or citizen ownership of equity. [ 2 ] There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. [ 3 ] They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning , how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism. [ 4 ] \n A socialist economic system would consist of a system of production and distribution organized to directly satisfy economic demands and human needs, so that goods and services would be produced directly for use instead of for private profit [ 5 ] driven by the accumulation of capital . Accounting would be based on physical quantities , a common physical magnitude, or a direct measure of labour-time in place of financial calculation. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] Distribution would be based on the principle to each according to his contribution . \n As a political movement , socialism includes a diverse array of political philosophies, ranging from reformism to revolutionary socialism . Proponents of state socialism advocate the nationalisation of the means of production, distribution and exchange as a strategy for implementing socialism. In contrast, libertarian socialism proposes the traditional view of direct worker\'s control of the means of production and opposes the use of state power to achieve such an arrangement, opposing both parliamentary politics and state ownership. [ citation needed ] Democratic socialism seeks to establish socialism through democratic processes and propagate its ideals within the context of a democratic political system . \n Modern socialism originated from an 18th-century intellectual and working class political movement that criticised the effects of industrialisation and private property on society. In the early 19th-century, "socialism" referred to any concern for the social problems of capitalism irrespective of the solutions to those problems. However, by the late 19th-century, "socialism" had come to signify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for an alternative system based on some form of social ownership. [ 8 ]  Marxists expanded further on this, attributing scientific assessment and democratic planning as critical elements of socialism.

Marxian socialism is philosophically materialist as well as having at its centre a commitment to historical materialism . Many forms of socialist theory hold that human behaviour is largely shaped by the social environment. In particular, Marxism and socialists inspired by Marxist theory, holds that social mores , values, cultural traits and economic practices are social creations, and are not the result of an immutable natural law . [ 10 ] The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labour from alienating work . Marxists argue that freeing the individual from the necessity of performing alienating work in order to receive goods would allow people to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labour for others. For Marxists, the stage of economic development in which this is possible, sometimes called full communism, is contingent upon advances in the productive capabilities of society. \n Socialists generally argue that capitalism concentrates power and wealth within a small segment of society that controls the means of production and derives its wealth through a system of exploitation . This creates a stratified society based on unequal social relations that fails to provide equal opportunities for every individual to maximise their potential, [ 11 ] and does not utilise available technology and resources to their maximum potential in the interests of the public. [ 12 ] \n Economics \n See also: Socialist economics &#160;and Production for use \n The original conception of socialism was an economic system whereby production was organised in a way to directly produce goods and services for their utility (or use-value in classical and Marxian economics): the direct allocation of resources in terms of physical units as opposed to financial calculation and the economic laws of capitalism (see: Law of value ), often entailing the end of capitalistic economic categories such as rent , interest , profit and money . [ 13 ] In a fully developed socialist economy, production and balancing factor inputs with outputs becomes a technical process to be undertaken by engineers. [ 14 ] \n Market socialism refers to an array of different economic theories and systems that utilise the market mechanism to organise production and to allocate factor inputs among socially owned enterprises, with the economic surplus (profits) accruing to society in a social dividend as opposed to private capital owners. [ 15 ] Variations of market socialism include Libertarian proposals such as mutualism , based on classical economics, and neoclassical economic models such as the Lange Model . \n The ownership of the means of production can be based on direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative ; or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production; or public ownership by a state apparatus. Public ownership may refer to the creation of state-owned enterprises , nationalisation , municipalisation or autonomous collective institutions. The fundamental feature of a socialist economy is that publicly owned, worker-run institutions produce goods and services in at least the commanding heights of the economy. [ 16 ] \n Management and control over the activities of enterprises are based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximise occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals. [ 17 ] \n The role and use of money in a hypothetical socialist economy is a contested issue. Socialists including Karl Marx , Robert Owen , Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and John Stuart Mill advocated various forms of labour vouchers or labour-credits, which like money would be used to acquire articles of consumption, but unlike money, they are unable to become capital and would not be used to allocate resources within the production process. Bolshevik revolutionary Leon Trotsky argued that, following a socialist revolution, money could not be arbitrarily abolished. Money had to exhaust its "historic mission" (continue to be used until it became redundant), and then would be transformed into bookkeeping receipts for statisticians, and only in the more distant future would it might not be required even for that role. [ 18 ] \n \n "I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society." \n \xe2\x80\x94 Albert Einstein , Why Socialism? , 1949 [ 19 ]  \n \n Planned economy \n Main article: Planned economy \n A planned economy is a type of economy consisting of a mixture of public ownership of the means of production and the coordination of production and distribution through economic planning . There are two major types of planning: decentralized-planning and centralized-planning. Enrico Barone provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand. [ 20 ] \n The most prominent example of a planned economy was the economic system of the Soviet Union , and as such, the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the Communist states of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. (See also: Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning ). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc are further classified as command economies , which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets. [ 21 ] Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localized agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an "administered" or "managed" economy. [ 22 ] \n Although central planning was largely supported by Marxist Leninists , some factions within the Soviet Union before the rise of Stalinism held positions contrary to central planning. Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favor of decentralized planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people who in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions. [ 23 ] \n Various economists and political theorists , including Richard D. Wolff and Stephen Resnick , have criticised the notion that the Soviet-style planned economies represented a type of socialist economy. This analysis highlights the fact that the Soviet economy was structured upon the accumulation of capital and the extraction of surplus value from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest the surplus in new production in a perpetual cycle \xe2\x80\x93 or to distribute to managers and senior officials in the form of bonuses, indicating the Soviet Union (and other Soviet-type economies) were in reality state capitalist economies. [ 24 ] Other socialists have focused their analyses on the lack of self-management , the continued existence of financial calculation and the existence of a bureaucratic elite based on hierarchical and centralised powers of authority in the Soviet model, leading them to conclude that the Soviet system was not socialist, instead categorising it as bureaucratic collectivism , state capitalism or deformed workers\' states . \n Self-managed economy \n See also: Decentralized planning &#160;and Workers\' self-management \n A self-managed, decentralised economy is based upon autonomous self-regulating economic units and a decentralised mechanism of resource allocation and decision-making. This model has found support in notable classical and neoclassical economists including Alfred Marshall , John Stuart Mill and Jaroslav Vanek . There are numerous variations of self-management, including labour-managed firms and worker-managed firms. The goals of self-management are to eliminate exploitation and reduce alienation . [ 25 ] \n One such system is the cooperative economy, a largely free market economy in which workers manage the firms and democratically determine remuneration levels and labour divisions. Productive resources would be legally owned by the cooperative and rented to the workers, who would enjoy usufruct rights. [ 26 ] Another form of decentralised planning is the use of cybernetics , or the use of computers to manage the allocation of economic inputs. The socialist-run government of Salvador Allende in Chile experimented with Project Cybersyn , a real-time information bridge between the government, state enterprises and consumers. [ 27 ] Another, more recent, variant is participatory economics , wherein the economy is planned by decentralised councils of workers and consumers. Workers would be remunerated solely according to effort and sacrifice, so that those engaged in dangerous, uncomfortable, and strenuous work would receive the highest incomes and could thereby work less. [ 28 ] A contemporary model for a self-managed, non-market socialism is Pat Devine \'s model of negotiated coordination. Negotiated coordination is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production. [ 29 ] \n Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as a new, alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy and centrally planned economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. [ 30 ] \n Anarchist communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state , private property , and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production . [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] \n The economy of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia established a system based on market-based allocation, social ownership of the means of production and self-management within firms. This system substituted Yugoslavia\'s Soviet-type central planning with a decentralized, self-managed system after reforms in 1953. [ 33 ] Another practical example of worker\'s self-management was syndicalism as practiced in Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War. \n State-directed economy \n See also: State socialism \n State socialism can be used to classify any variety of socialist philosophies that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the state apparatus , either as a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism, or as an end-goal in itself. Typically it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society (and the public interest) instead of workers\' councils or workplace democracy. \n A state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various Social democratic political parties during the 20th century. This ideology influenced the policies of the British Labour Party during Clement Attlee\'s administration. In the biography of the 1945 UK Labour Party Prime Minister Clement Attlee , Francis Beckett states: "the government... wanted what would become known as a mixed economy". [ 34 ] \n Nationalisation in the UK was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry (i.e. with compensation). British Aerospace was a combination of major aircraft companies British Aircraft Corporation , Hawker Siddeley and others. British Shipbuilders was a combination of the major shipbuilding companies including Cammell Laird , Govan Shipbuilders , Swan Hunter , and Yarrow Shipbuilders ; the nationalisation of the coal mines in 1947 created a coal board charged with running the coal industry commercially so as to be able to meet the interest payable on the bonds which the former mine owners\' shares had been converted into. [ 35 ]  [ 36 ] \n Market socialism \n Main article: Market socialism \n Market socialism consists of publicly owned or cooperatively owned enterprises operating in a market economy . It is a system that utilises the market and monetary prices for the allocation and accounting of the means of production , thereby retaining the process of capital accumulation . The profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees or finance public institutions. [ 37 ] In state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a social dividend , eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. The neoclassical economist L\xc3\xa9on Walras believed that a socialist economy based on state ownership of land and natural resources would provide a means of public finance to make income taxes unnecessary. [ 38 ] Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management. \n The current economic system in China is formally referred to as a Socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics . It combines a large state sector that comprises the \'commanding heights\' of the economy, which are guaranteed their public ownership status by law, [ 39 ] with a private sector mainly engaged in commodity production and light industry responsible from anywhere between 33% [ 40 ] (People\'s Daily Online 2005) to over 70% of GDP generated in 2005. [ 41 ] Although there has been a rapid expansion of private-sector activity since the 1980s, privatisation of state assets was virtually halted and were partially reversed in 2005. [ 42 ] The current Chinese economy consists of 150 corporatised state-owned enterprises that report directly to China\'s central government. [ 43 ] By 2008, these state-owned corporations had become increasingly dynamic and generated large increases in revenue for the state, [ 44 ]  [ 45 ] resulting in a state-sector led recovery during the 2009 financial crises while accounting for most of China\'s economic growth. [ 46 ] However, the Chinese economic model is widely cited as a contemporary form of state capitalism, the major difference between Western capitalism and the Chinese model being the degree of state-ownership of shares in publicly listed corporations. \n The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has adopted a similar model after the Doi Moi economic renovation, but slightly differs from the Chinese model in that the Vietnamese government retains firm control over the state sector and strategic industries, but allows for private-sector activity in commodity production. [ 47 ] \n Social and Political theory \n In this context, socialism has been used to refer to a political movement , a political philosophy and a hypothetical form of society these movements aim to achieve. As a result, in a political context socialism has come to refer to the strategy (for achieving a socialist society) or policies promoted by socialist organisations and socialist political parties; all of which have no connection to socialism as a socioeconomic system. \n Marxism \n Main articles: Marxism and Socialism (Marxism) \n \n "At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or \xe2\x80\x93 this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. Then begins an era of social revolution.

It was these advances in the productive forces combined with the old social relations of production of capitalism that would generate contradictions, leading to working-class consciousness. [ 49 ] \n Marx and Engels held the view that the consciousness of those who earn a wage or salary (the working class in the broadest Marxist sense) would be moulded by their conditions of wage slavery , leading to a tendency to seek their freedom or emancipation by overthrowing ownership of the means of production by capitalists, and consequently, overthrowing the state that upheld this economic order. For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a classless society in which the state would wither away . \n The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that will displace capitalism and precede communism . The major characteristics of socialism (particularly as conceived by Marx and Engels after the Paris Commune of 1871) are that the proletariat will control the means of production through a workers\' state erected by the workers in their interests. Economic activity would still be organised through the use of incentive systems and social classes would still exist, but to a lesser and diminishing extent than under capitalism. \n For orthodox Marxists, socialism is the lower stage of communism based on the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution " while upper stage communism is based on the principle of " from each according to his ability, to each according to his need "; the upper stage becoming possible only after the socialist stage further develops economic efficiency and the automation of production has led to a superabundance of goods and services. [ 50 ]  [ 51 ] \n Marx argued that the material productive forces (in industry and commerce) brought into existence by capitalism predicated a cooperative society since production had become a mass social, collective activity of the working class to create commodities but with private ownership (the relations of production or property relations). This conflict between collective effort in large factories and private ownership would bring about a conscious desire in the working class to establish collective ownership commensurate with the collective efforts their daily experience. [ 48 ] \n Che Guevara and Mao Zedong sought socialism based on the rural peasantry rather than the urban working class. Che Guevara attempted to inspire the peasants of Bolivia by his own example into a change of consciousness. Guevara said in 1965: \n \n Socialism cannot exist without a change in consciousness resulting in a new fraternal attitude toward humanity, both at an individual level, within the societies where socialism is being built or has been built, and on a world scale, with regard to all peoples suffering from imperialist oppression. [ 52 ] \n \n Evolutionary and Institutional economics \n Thorstein Veblen , a leading American institutionalist and evolutionary economist , argued that a subset of the working-class, the technical specialists and engineers, would become the driving force behind socioeconomic change within capitalism. There is an antagonism between industry and business, where industry refers to the process of producing goods and services and business is defined as the process of "making money". Thorstein Veblen saw socialism as an immediate stage in an ongoing evolutionary process in economics that would result from the natural decay of the system of business enterprise. In contrast to Marx, he did not believe socialism would be the result of political struggle or political revolution by the working class as a whole and did not believe it to be the ultimate goal of humanity. [ 53 ] But like Marx, Veblen saw technology as the underlying force driving social change. \n Joseph Schumpeter viewed intellectuals and the intelligentsia as the group within society that would gradually move society toward socialism. Socialism would be partially a result of socio-economic evolution, the growth of workers\' self-management, industrial democracy and social planning, and partially from political pressure on the part of intellectuals in Western society. [ 54 ] \n Role of the state \n Socialists have different perspectives on the state and its role in revolutionary struggles, constructing socialism, and within an established socialist economy. \n Preceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists, including reformists , orthodox Marxist currents such as council communism and the Mensheviks, and Anarchists / Libertarian socialists criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. [ 55 ] \n Joseph Schumpeter rejected the association of socialism and social ownership with state ownership over the means of production, because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted into a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that, just as there were different institutions within feudalism , there will be different institutions with different functions within socialism. The state, along with the concept of property and taxation , are concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism); placing them within the context of a future socialist society amounts to a distortion of these concepts. [ 56 ] \n Utopian versus scientific \n Main articles: Utopian socialism and Scientific socialism \n Utopian socialism is a label ascribed to earlier socialists whose emphasis was on designing or imagining ideal forms of society. A utopian socialist is based on an idealist philosophy, where an ideal is envisioned and then worked towards, in contrast to Marxisms materialist methodology. \n For Marxists, the development of capitalism in western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because, according to the Communist Manifesto , "What the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers", [ 57 ] namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society. \n Reform versus revolution \n Main articles: Revolutionary socialism and Reformism \n Revolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socio-economic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of "revolution". Orthodox Maxists and Left Communists take an Impossibilist stance, believing revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society resulting from technological changes in the productive forces. In contrast, Marxist-Leninists and most Trotskyists advocate Vanguardism : the creation of a democratic centralist revolutionary Vanguard party led by a cadre of professional revolutionaries to overthrow the capitalist state and, eventually, the institution of the state altogether. "Revolution" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection, [ 58 ] but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class. \n Reformism is generally associated with social democracy and gradualist democratic socialism. Reformism is the belief that socialists should stand in parliamentary elections within capitalist society, and if elected, utilize the machinery of government to pass political and social reforms for the purposes of ameliorating the instabilities and inequities of capitalism. \n Politics \n \n \n \n  \nSocialists in Union Square, N.Y.C. on May Day 1912 \n \n \n The major socialist political movements are described below. Independent socialist theorists, [utopian socialist] authors, and academic supporters of socialism may not be represented in these movements. Some political groups have called themselves socialist while holding views that some consider antithetical to socialism. The term socialist has also been used by some politicians on the political right as an epithet against certain individuals who do not consider themselves to be socialists, and against policies that are not considered socialist by their proponents. \n There are many variations of socialism and as such there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism. However there have been common elements identified by scholars. [ 59 ] Angelo S. Rappoport in his Dictionary of Socialism (1924) analysed forty definitions of socialism to conclude that common elements of socialism include: general criticisms of the social effects of private ownership and control of capital - as being the cause of poverty, low wages, unemployment, economic and social inequality, and a lack of economic security; a general view that the solution to these problems is a form of collective control over the means of production , distribution and exchange (the degree and means of control vary amongst socialist movements); agreement that the outcome of this collective control should be a society based upon social justice , including social equality, economic protection of people, and should provide a more satisfying life for most people. [ 60 ]  Bhikhu Parekh in The Concepts of Socialism (1975) identifies four core principles of socialism and particularly socialist society: sociality, social responsibility, cooperation, and planning. [ 61 ]  Michael Freeden in his study Ideologies and Political Theory (1996) states that all socialists share five themes: the first is that socialism posits that society is more than a mere collection of individuals; second, that it considers human welfare a desirable objective; third, that it considers humans by nature to be active and productive; fourth, it holds the belief of human equality; and fifth, that history is progressive and will create positive change on the condition that humans work to achieve such change. [ 61 ] \n Anarchism \n Main article: Anarchism \n Anarchism is often defined as a political philosophy which holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. [ 62 ]  [ 63 ] However, others argue that while anti-statism is central, it is inadequate to define anarchism. [ 64 ] Therefore they argue, alternatively, that anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of human relations, including, but not only, the state system. [ 65 ]  [ 66 ]  [ 67 ]  [ 68 ]  [ 69 ]  [ 70 ]  [ 71 ] Proponents of anarchism, known as "anarchists", advocate stateless societies based on non- hierarchical [ 66 ]  [ 72 ]  [ 73 ]  voluntary associations . [ 74 ]  [ 75 ]  Mutualists advocate market socialism, collectivist anarchists workers cooperatives and salaries based on the amount of time contributed to production, anarcho-communists advocate a direct transition from capitalism to libertarian communism and a gift economy and anarcho-syndicalists worker\'s direct action and the general strike . \n Libertarian socialism \n Main article: Libertarian socialism \n Libertarian socialism is a group of political philosophies that promote a non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic society without private property in the means of production . Libertarian socialists believe in converting present-day private productive property into common or public goods , while retaining respect for personal property . [ 76 ] Libertarian socialism is opposed to coercive forms of social organization. It promotes free association in place of government and opposes the social relations of capitalism, such as wage labor . [ 77 ] The term libertarian socialism is used by some socialists to differentiate their philosophy from state socialism , [ 78 ]  [ 79 ] and by some as a synonym for left anarchism . [ 80 ]  [ 81 ]  [ 82 ] Currents within libertarian socialism include Marxist tendencies such as left communism , council communism and autonomism , as well as non-Marxist movements such as social anarchism , Communalism , Participism , and Inclusive Democracy . \n Democratic socialism \n Main article: Democratic socialism \n Modern democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a temporary measure to reform the current system, but others support more revolutionary tactics to establish socialism. Conversely, modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative reform of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences. \n The major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a welfare state and unemployment insurance as a means to "humanize" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to "humanize" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions. [ 83 ] \n Democratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on economic democracy by and for the working class. Democratic socialists oppose democratic centralism and the revolutionary vanguard party of Leninism . Democratic socialism is difficult to define, and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, reformist or evolutionary path to socialism, rather than a revolutionary one. [ 84 ] \n Religious socialism \n Main articles: Socialism and Islam and Christian socialism \n Christian socialism is a broad concept involving an intertwining of the Christian religion with the politics and economic theories of socialism. \n Islamic socialism is a term coined by various Muslim leaders to describe a more spiritual form of socialism. Muslim socialists believe that the teachings of the Qur\'an and Muhammad are compatible with principles of equality and public ownership drawing inspiration from the early Medina welfare state established by the Prophet Muhammad . Muslim Socialists are more conservative than their western contemporaries and find their roots in Anti-imperialism , anti-colonialism and Arab nationalism . Islamic Socialist leaders believe in Democracy and deriving legitimacy from public mandate as opposed to religious texts. \n Buddhist Socialism is another concept that seeks to reduce unnecessary consumption and create harmony while ensuring everyone\'s basic needs are met. [ citation needed ] \n Social democracy \n Main article: Social democracy \n Social democracy is not itself a socialist system. Rather, traditional social democrats advocated the creation of socialism through political reforms by operating within the existing political system of capitalism. The social democratic movement sought to elect socialists to political office to implement reforms. The modern social democratic movement has abandoned [ citation needed ] the goal of moving toward a socialist economy and instead advocates for social reforms to improve capitalism, such as a welfare state and unemployment benefits. It is best demonstrated by the economic format which has been used in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland in the past few decades. [ 85 ] This approach has been called the Nordic model . \n In the late 20th century, the term "socialist" became used by Third Way social democrats to refer to a set of ethical ideals and values as opposed to a form of socio-economic system. It is used in this way by Anthony Giddens , who rejects conventional definitions and implementations of socialism. [ 9 ] Giddens states: "The only common characteristic of socialist doctrines is their ethical content." and says that "Socialism is the pursuit of ideas of social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality - ideas brought together by a condemnation of the evils and injustices of capitalism". [ 9 ] However Gidden\'s Third Way has faced condemnation by left-wing opponents, including anti-Third Way social democrats who denounce Giddens\' Third Way for being anti-socialist and pro-capitalist in practice. [ 86 ] \n Syndicalism \n Main article: Syndicalism \n Syndicalism is a social movement that operates through industrial trade unions and rejects state socialism and the use of establishment politics to establish or promote socialism. They reject using state power to construct a socialist society, favoring strategies such as the General strike . Syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production. \n Some Marxist currents advocate Syndicalism, such as DeLeonism . \n History \n Main article: History of socialism \n The term socialism is attributed to Pierre Leroux , [ 87 ] and to Marie Roch Louis Reybaud ; and in Britain to Robert Owen in 1827, father of the cooperative movement . [ 88 ]  [ 89 ] Socialist models and ideas espousing common or public ownership have existed since antiquity. Mazdak , a Persian communal proto-socialist, [ 90 ] instituted communal possessions and advocated the public good. And it has been claimed, though controversially, that there were elements of socialist thought in the politics of classical Greek philosophers Plato [ 91 ] and Aristotle . [ 92 ] \n The first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon is regarded as the first individual to coin the term socialism . [ 93 ] Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and would be based upon equal opportunities. [ 94 ] [ unreliable source? ] He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. [ 93 ] The key focus of Saint-Simon\'s socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism, and a belief that science was the key to progress. [ 95 ] \n \n \n \n  \n Charles Fourier , influential early French socialist thinker \n \n \n This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, [ 93 ] and thus embodied a desire for a more directed or planned economy . Other early socialist thinkers, such as Thomas Hodgkin and Charles Hall, based their ideas on David Ricardo \'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labour \xe2\x80\x93 the cost of the labour (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. [ 96 ] \n West European social critics, including Robert Owen , Charles Fourier , Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , Louis Blanc , Charles Hall and Saint-Simon , were the first modern socialists who criticised the excessive poverty and inequality of the Industrial Revolution . They advocated reform, with some such as Robert Owen advocating the transformation of society to small communities without private property. Robert Owen\'s contribution to modern socialism was his understanding that actions and characteristics of individuals were largely determined by the social environment they were raised in and exposed to. [ 95 ] On the other hand Charles Fourier advocated phalansteres which were communities that respected individual desires (including sexual preferences), affinities and creativity and saw that work has to be made enjoyable for people. [ 97 ] The ideas of Owen and Fourier were tried in practice in numerous intentional communities around Europe and the American continent in the mid-19th century. \n Linguistically, the contemporary connotation of the words socialism and communism accorded with the adherents\' and opponents\' cultural attitude towards religion. In Christian Europe, of the two, communism was believed the atheist way of life. In Protestant England, the word communism was too culturally and aurally close to the Roman Catholic communion rite , hence English atheists denoted themselves socialists. [ 98 ] \n Friedrich Engels argued that in 1848, at the time when the Communist Manifesto was published, "socialism was respectable on the continent, while communism was not." The Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France were considered "respectable" socialists, while working-class movements that "proclaimed the necessity of total social change" denoted themselves communists. This latter branch of socialism produced the communist work of \xc3\x89tienne Cabet in France and Wilhelm Weitling in Germany. [ 99 ] \n Etymology \n The term "socialism" was created by Henri de Saint-Simon , a founder of utopian socialism. The term "socialism" was created to contrast against the liberal doctrine of " individualism ". [ 100 ] The original socialists condemned liberal individualism as failing to address social concerns of poverty, social oppression, and gross inequality of wealth. [ 100 ] They viewed liberal individualism as degenerating society into supporting selfish egoism and that harmed community life through promoting a society based on competition. [ 100 ] They presented socialism as an alternative to liberal individualism, that advocated a society based on cooperation. [ 100 ] \n First International and Second International \n \n \n \n  \n Mikhail Bakunin speaking to members of the IWA at the Basel Congress in 1869 \n \n \n The International Workingmen\'s Association (IWA), also known as the First International, was founded in London in 1864. The IWA held a preliminary conference in 1865, and had its first congress at Geneva in 1866. Due to the wide variety of philosophies present in the First International, there was conflict from the start. The first objections to Marx\'s came from the Mutualists who opposed communism and statism . However, shortly after Mikhail Bakunin and his followers (called Collectivists while in the International) joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. [ 101 ] The clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The First International became the first major international forum for the promulgation of socialist ideas. \n As the ideas of Marx and Engels took on flesh, particularly in central Europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. In 1889, on the centennial of the French Revolution of 1789, the Second International was founded, with 384 delegates from 20 countries representing about 300 labour and socialist organisations. [ 102 ] It was termed the "Socialist International" and Engels was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. Anarchists were ejected and not allowed in mainly because of the pressure from marxists. [ 103 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJean Jaures \n \n \n Revolutions of 1917\xe2\x80\x931936 \n \n \n \n  \n Leon Trotsky , Vladimir Lenin , and Lev Kamenev at the Second Communist Party Congress, 1919. \n \n \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n If Socialism can only be realized when the intellectual development of all the people permits it, then we shall not see Socialism for at least five hundred years. \n \xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x94 Vladimir Lenin , November 1917 [ 104 ] \n \n \n \n By 1917, the patriotism of World War I changed into political radicalism in most of Europe, the United States , and Australia. In February 1917, revolution exploded in Russia . Workers, soldiers and peasants established soviets (councils), the monarchy fell, and a provisional government convoked pending the election of a constituent assembly . \n In April of that year, Vladimir Lenin arrived in Russia from Switzerland, calling for "All power to the soviets." In October, after his party, the Bolsheviks , had seized power in an October Revolution it won support of most soviets at the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets . As a matter of political pragmatism, Lenin reversed Marx\'s order of economics over politics, allowing for a political revolution led by a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries rather than a spontaneous establishment of socialist institutions led by a spontaneous uprising of the working class as predicted by Karl Marx . [ 105 ] On 25 January 1918, at the Petrograd Soviet , Lenin declared "Long live the world socialist revolution!" [ 106 ] He proposed an immediate armistice on all fronts, and transferred the land of the landed proprietors, the crown and the monasteries to the peasant committees without compensation. [ 107 ] \n On 26 January 1918, the day after assuming executive power, Lenin wrote Draft Regulations on Workers\' Control , which granted workers control of businesses with more than five workers and office employees, and access to all books, documents and stocks, and whose decisions were to be "binding upon the owners of the enterprises". [ 108 ] Governing through the elected soviets, and in alliance with the peasant-based Left Socialist-Revolutionaries , the Bolshevik government began nationalising banks, industry, and disavowed the national debts of the deposed Romanov royal r\xc3\xa9gime. It sued for peace , withdrawing from World War I, and convoked a Constituent Assembly in which the peasant Socialist-Revolutionary Party (SR) won a majority. [ 109 ] \n The Constituent Assembly elected Socialist-Revolutionary leader Victor Chernov President of a Russian republic, but rejected the Bolshevik proposal that it endorse the Soviet decrees on land, peace and workers\' control, and acknowledge the power of the Soviets of Workers\', Soldiers\' and Peasants\' Deputies. The next day, the Bolsheviks declared that the assembly was elected on outdated party lists, [ 110 ] and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviets dissolved it. [ 111 ]  [ 112 ] \n Left wing groups which did not agree with the centralization and abandonment of the soviets by the Bolshevik Party led Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks which were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks led or supported by left wing groups including Socialist Revolutionaries , [ 113 ]  Left Socialist Revolutionaries , Mensheviks , and anarchists . [ 114 ] Within this left wing discontent the most large scale events were the worker\xc2\xb4s Kronstadt rebellion [ 115 ]  [ 116 ]  [ 117 ] and the anarchist led Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine uprising which controoled an area known as the Free Territory . [ 118 ]  [ 119 ]  [ 120 ] \n The Bolshevik Russian Revolution of January 1918 engendered Communist parties worldwide, and their concomitant revolutions of 1917-23 . Few Communists doubted that the Russian success of socialism depended upon successful, working-class socialist revolutions in developed capitalist countries. [ 121 ]  [ 122 ] In 1919, Lenin and Trotsky organised the world\'s Communist parties into a new international association of workers&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 the Communist International , (Comintern), also called the Third International. \n The Russian Revolution also influenced uprisings in other countries around this time. The German Revolution of 1918\xe2\x80\x931919 resulted in the replacement of Germany\'s imperial government with a republic . The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the formal establishment of the Weimar Republic in August 1919 and included an episode known as the Bavarian Soviet Republic [ 123 ]  [ 124 ]  [ 125 ]  [ 126 ] and the Spartacist uprising . In Italy the events known as the Biennio Rosso  [ 127 ]  [ 128 ] was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as self-management experiments through land and factories occupations. In Turin and Milan , workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists organized around the Unione Sindacale Italiana . [ 129 ] \n \n \n \n  \n Rosa Luxemburg , prominent Marxist revolutionary, martyr and leader of the German Spartacist uprising , 1919. \n \n \n By 1920, the Red Army , under its commander Trotsky, had largely defeated the royalist White Armies. In 1921, War Communism was ended and, under the New Economic Policy (NEP), private ownership was allowed for small and medium peasant enterprises. While industry remained largely state-controlled, Lenin acknowledged that the NEP was a necessary capitalist measure for a country unripe for socialism. Profiteering returned in the form of "NEP men" and rich peasants ( Kulaks ) gained power in the countryside. [ 130 ] \n In 1922, the fourth congress of the Communist International took up the policy of the United Front , urging Communists to work with rank and file Social Democrats while remaining critical of their leaders, whom they criticised for betraying the working class by supporting the war efforts of their respective capitalist classes. For their part, the social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution, and later, the growing authoritarianism of the Communist Parties. When the Communist Party of Great Britain applied to affiliate to the Labour Party in 1920 it was turned down. \n In 1923, on seeing the Soviet State\'s growing coercive power, the dying Lenin said Russia had reverted to "a bourgeois tsarist machine... barely varnished with socialism." [ 131 ] After Lenin\'s death in January 1924, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union \xe2\x80\x93 then increasingly under the control of Joseph Stalin \xe2\x80\x93 rejected the theory that socialism could not be built solely in the Soviet Union, in favour of the concept of Socialism in One Country . Despite the marginalised Left Opposition \'s demand for the restoration of Soviet democracy, Stalin developed a bureaucratic, authoritarian government, that was condemned by democratic socialists, anarchists and Trotskyists for undermining the initial socialist ideals of the Bolshevik Russian Revolution. [ 132 ]  [ 133 ] [ self-published source? ] [ unreliable source? ] \n The Russian Revolution of October 1917 brought about the definitive ideological division between Communists as denoted with a capital "\xd0\xa1" on the one hand and other communist and socialist trends such as anarcho-communists and social democrats, on the other. The Left Opposition in the Soviet Union gave rise to Trotskyism which was to remain isolated and insignificant for another fifty years, except in Sri Lanka, where Trotskyism gained the majority and the pro-Moscow wing was expelled from the Communist Party. \n In Spain in 1936, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederaci\xc3\xb3n Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the Spanish Civil War (1936\xe2\x80\x931939). [ 134 ] In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they collectivised the land. [ 135 ]  [ 136 ] The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers\' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia , Aragon , Andalusia , and parts of the Levante . Much of Spain\'s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia , the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party of Spain influence, as the Soviet -allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes . Anarchist historian Sam Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution , [ 137 ] which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." [ 138 ] \n After World War II \n \n \n \n  \n Joseph Stalin , leader of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1953. \n \n \n In 1951, British Health Minister Aneurin Bevan expressed the view that, "It is probably true that Western Europe would have gone socialist after the war if Soviet behaviour had not given it too grim a visage. Soviet Communism and Socialism are not yet sufficiently distinguished in many minds." [ 139 ] \n In 1951, the Socialist International was re-founded by the European social democratic parties. It declared: "Communism has split the International Labour Movement and has set back the realisation of Socialism in many countries for decades... Communism falsely claims a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition. It has built up a rigid theology which is incompatible with the critical spirit of Marxism." [ 140 ] \n In the postwar years, socialism became increasingly influential throughout the so-called Third World . Countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America frequently nationalised industries held by foreign owners. The Soviet Union had become a superpower through its adoption of a planned economy, albeit at enormous human cost. This achievement seemed hugely impressive from the outside, and convinced many nationalists in the former colonies, not necessarily communists or even socialists, of the virtues of state planning and state-guided models of social development. \n Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n Prior to its dissolution in 1991, the USSR had the second largest economy in the world after the United States. [ 141 ] The economy of the Soviet Union was the modern world\'s first centrally planned economy. It was based on a system of state ownership of industry managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and the Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Economic planning was conducted through a series of Five-Year Plans . The emphasis was put on a very fast development of heavy industry and the nation became one of the world\'s top manufacturers of a large number of basic and heavy industrial products, but it lagged behind in the output of light industrial production and consumer durables. \n As the Soviet economy grew more complex, it required more and more complex disaggregation of control figures (plan targets) and factory inputs. As it required more communication between the enterprises and the planning ministries, and as the number of enterprises, trusts, and ministries multiplied, the Soviet economy started stagnating. The Soviet economy was increasingly sluggish when it came to responding to change, adapting cost\xe2\x88\x92saving technologies, and providing incentives at all levels to improve growth, productivity and efficiency. \n Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down and economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be under-produced, leading to shortages, while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts, while consumers developed a black market for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly under-produced. \n Conceding the weaknesses of their past approaches in solving new problems, the leaders of the late 1980s, headed by Mikhail Gorbachev , were seeking to mould a program of economic reform to galvanise the economy. However, by 1990 the Soviet government had lost control over economic conditions. Government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of unprofitable enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue operations. \n The industrial production system in the Soviet Union suffered a political and economic collapse in 1991, after which two transitions occurred: first from centrally planned to market-based economies, and secondly, from state-ownership to private-ownership of economic enterprises. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic integration of the Soviet republics was dissolved, and overall industrial activity declined substantially. [ 142 ] A lasting legacy remains in the physical infrastructure created during decades of combined industrial production practices. \n Social democrats in power \n Main articles: Social democracy , Welfare state , and Nordic model \n The Australian Labor Party , the first social democratic labour party in the world, was formed in 1891. In 1904, Australians elected the first Labor Party prime minister in the world: Chris Watson. In 1945, the British Labour Party , led by Clement Attlee , was elected to office based upon a radical socialist programme. Social Democratic parties dominated post-war politics in countries such as France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium and Norway. In Sweden, the Social Democratic Party held power from 1936 to 1976, 1982 to 1991, and 1994 to 2006. At one point, France claimed to be the world\'s most state-controlled capitalist country. The nationalised public utilities included Charbonnages de France (CDF), Electricit\xc3\xa9 de France (EDF), Gaz de France (GDF), Air France, Banque de France, and R\xc3\xa9gie Nationale des Usines Renault. [ 143 ] Post-World War II social democratic governments introduced social reform and wealth redistribution via state welfare and taxation. \n United Kingdom \n \n \n \n  \n Clement Attlee , U.K. Prime Minister, Labour Party government, 1945\xe2\x80\x9351. \n \n \n In the UK, the Labour Party was influenced by the British social reformer William Beveridge , who had identified five "Giant Evils" afflicting the working class of the pre-war period: "want" (poverty), disease, "ignorance" (lack of access to education), "squalor" ( poor housing ), and "idleness" (unemployment). [ 144 ]  Unemployment benefits , national insurance and state pensions were introduced by the 1945 Labour government. Aneurin Bevan , who had introduced the Labour Party\'s National Health Service in 1948, criticised the Attlee government for not progressing further, demanding economic planning and criticising the implementation of nationalisation for not empowering the workers with democratic control of operations. \n The UK Labour Government nationalised major public utilities such as mines, gas, coal, electricity, rail, iron, steel, and the Bank of England. British Petroleum, privatised in 1987, was officially nationalised in 1951, [ 145 ] and there was further government intervention during the 1974\xe2\x80\x9379 Labour Government [ 146 ]  Anthony Crosland said that in 1956, 25 per cent of British industry was nationalised, and that public employees, including those in nationalised industries, constituted a similar percentage of the country\'s total employed population. [ 147 ] The Labour government, however, did not seek to end capitalism, and the "government had not the smallest intention of bringing in the \'common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange\'", [ 148 ] Labour re-nationalised steel (1967, British Steel) after the Conservatives denationalised it, and nationalised car production (1976, British Leyland). [ 149 ] In 1977, major aircraft companies and shipbuilding were nationalised. \n The National Health Service provided taxpayer-funded health care to everyone, free at the point of service. [ 150 ] Working-class housing was provided in council housing estates, and university education became available via a school grant system. Ellen Wilkinson , Minister for Education, introduced taxpayer-funded milk in schools, saying, in a 1946 Labour Party conference: "Free milk will be provided in Hoxton and Shoreditch , in Eton and Harrow . What more social equality can you have than that?" Clement Attlee\'s biographer argued that this policy "contributed enormously to the defeat of childhood illnesses resulting from bad diet. Generations of poor children grew up stronger and healthier, because of this one, small, and inexpensive act of generosity, by the Attlee government". [ 151 ] \n The "Nordic model" \n Main article: Nordic model \n The Nordic model refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries ( Denmark , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Finland ). This particular adaptation of the mixed market economy is characterised by more generous welfare states (relative to other developed countries), which are aimed specifically at enhancing individual autonomy, ensuring the universal provision of basic human rights and stabilising the economy. It is distinguished from other welfare states with similar goals by its emphasis on maximising labour force participation, promoting gender equality, egalitarian and extensive benefit levels, large magnitude of redistribution, and liberal use of expansionary fiscal policy. [ 152 ] This has included high degrees of labour union membership. In 2008, labour union density was 67.5% in Finland, 67.6% in Denmark, and 68.3% in Sweden. In comparison, union membership was 11.9% in the United States and 7.7% in France. [ 153 ] The Nordic Model, however, is not a single model with specific components or rules; each of the Nordic countries has its own economic and social models, sometimes with large differences from its neighbours. \n Social democrats adopt free market policies \n Main article: Third Way (centrism) \n Many social democratic parties, particularly after the Cold war, adopted neoliberal -based market policies that include privatisation , liberalisation , deregulation and financialisation ; resulting in the abandonment of pursuing the development of moderate socialism in favour of market liberalism . Despite the name, these pro-capitalist policies are radically different from the many non-capitalist free-market socialist theories that have existed throughout history. \n In 1959, the German Social Democratic Party had adopted the Godesberg Program , rejecting class struggle and Marxism. By 1980, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as Ronald Reagan in the U.S., Margaret Thatcher in Britain, and Brian Mulroney in Canada, the Western welfare state was attacked from within. Monetarists and neoliberasls attacked social welfare systems as impediments to private entrepreneurship at public expense. \n In the UK, the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock made a public attack against the entryist group Militant at the 1985 Labour Party conference; the group had been found ineligible for affiliation to Labour, and its supporters were gradually being expelled. The Kinnock leadership had refusal to support the 1984\xe2\x80\x931985 miner\'s strike over pit closures, a decision the party\'s left-wing and the National Union of Mineworkers blamed for its eventual defeat. In 1989, at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles , saying: \n \n Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity. Its goal is to achieve a peaceful world where these basic values can be enhanced and where each individual can live a meaningful life with the full development of his or her personality and talents, and with the guarantee of human and civil rights in a democratic framework of society . [ 154 ]  \n \n In the 1990s, the British Labour Party, under Tony Blair , posited policies based upon the free market economy to deliver public services via the Private finance initiative . In 1995, the Labour Party re-defined its stance on socialism by re-wording Clause IV of its constitution, effectively rejecting socialism by removing any and all references to public, direct worker or municipal ownership of the means of production. The Labour Party stated: "The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party. It believes that, by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone, so as to create, for each of us, the means to realise our true potential, and, for all of us, a community in which power, wealth, and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few." [ 155 ] \n The objectives of the Party of European Socialists , the European Parliament\'s socialist bloc, are now "to pursue international aims in respect of the principles on which the European Union is based, namely principles of freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy, respect of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and respect for the Rule of Law." As a result, today, the rallying cry of the French Revolution \xe2\x80\x93 "Egalit\xc3\xa9, Libert\xc3\xa9, Fraternit\xc3\xa9" \xe2\x80\x93 which overthrew absolutism and ushered industrialisation into French society, are promoted as essential socialist values. [ 156 ] \n Early 2000s \n Those who championed socialism in its various Marxist and class struggle forms sought out other arenas than the parties of social democracy at the turn of the 21st century. Anti-capitalism and anti-globalization movements rose to prominence particularly through events such as the opposition to the WTO meeting of 1999 in Seattle. Socialist-inspired groups played an important role in these new movements, which nevertheless embraced much broader layers of the population, and were championed by figures such as Noam Chomsky . The 2003 invasion of Iraq led to a significant anti-war movement in which socialists argued their case. \n The Financial crisis of 2007\xe2\x80\x932010 led to mainstream discussions as to whether "Marx was right". [ 157 ]  [ 158 ]  Time magazine ran an article \'Rethinking Marx\' and put Karl Marx on the cover of its European edition in a special for the 28 January 2009 Davos meeting . [ 159 ]  [ 160 ] A Globescan BBC poll on the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall (2009) found that 23% of respondents believe capitalism is "fatally flawed and a different economic system is needed", with that figure rising to over 40% of the population in France; while a majority of respondents including over 50% of Americans believe capitalism "has problems that can be addressed through regulation and reform". Of the 27 countries polled, majorities in 22 of them expressed support for governments to distribute wealth more evenly. [ 161 ] \n Africa \n Main article: African socialism \n \n \n \n  \n Kwame Nkrumah , the first President of Ghana and theorist of African socialism on a soviet postage stamp \n \n \n African socialism has been and continues to be a major ideology around the continent. Julius Nyerere was inspired by Fabian socialist ideals. [ 162 ] He was a firm believer in rural Africans and their traditions and ujamaa , a system of collectivisation that according to Nyerere was present before European imperialism. Essentially he believed Africans were already socialists. Other African socialists include Jomo Kenyatta , Kenneth Kaunda , Nelson Mandela and Kwame Nkrumah . Fela Kuti was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the African National Congress (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power, and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities. One of these gave rise to a mass movement of shack dwellers, Abahlali baseMjondolo that, despite major police suppression, continues to work for popular people\'s planning and against the creation of a market economy in land and housing. Today many African countries have been accused of being exploited under neoliberal economics. \n In his classic, "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" Walter Rodney says that Africa`s development can only be possible through its delinking with international capitalism and embracing a socialist template. \n [ 163 ] \n Asia \n The People\'s Republic of China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam are Asian countries remaining from the wave of Marxism-Leninist implemented socialism in the 20th century. States with socialist economies have largely moved away from centralised economic planning in the 21st century, placing a greater emphasis on markets. Forms include the Chinese socialist market economy and the Vietnamese socialist-oriented market economy . They utilise state-owned corporate management models as opposed to modelling socialist enterprise on traditional management styles employed by government agencies. \n In the People\'s Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party has led a transition from the command economy of the Mao period to an economic program they term the socialist market economy or " socialism with Chinese characteristics ". Under Deng Xiaoping , the leadership of China embarked upon a programme of market-based reform that was more sweeping than had been Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\'s perestroika program of the late 1980s. Deng\'s programme, however, maintained state ownership rights over land, state or cooperative ownership of much of the heavy industrial and manufacturing sectors and state influence in the banking and financial sectors. \n Elsewhere in Asia, some elected socialist parties and communist parties remain prominent, particularly in India and Nepal. The Communist Party of Nepal in particular calls for multi-party democracy, social equality, and economic prosperity. [ 164 ] In Singapore, a majority of the GDP is still generated from the state sector comprising government-linked companies. [ 165 ] In Japan, there has been a resurgent interest in the Japanese Communist Party among workers and youth. [ 166 ]  [ 167 ] In Malaysia, the Socialist Party of Malaysia got its first Member of Parliament, Dr. Jeyakumar Devaraj , after the 2008 general election . \n Europe \n In Europe, the socialist Left Party in Germany grew in popularity [ 168 ] due to dissatisfaction with the increasingly neoliberal policies of the SPD, becoming the fourth biggest party in parliament in the general election on 27 September 2009. [ 169 ] Communist candidate Dimitris Christofias won a crucial presidential runoff in Cyprus, defeating his conservative rival with a majority of 53%. [ 170 ] In Greece, in the general election on 17 June 2012, Coalition of the Radical Left (Syriza) won 26.89% of the votes and became the second largest party in parliament. \n In Ireland, in the 2009 European election , Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party took one of three seats in the capital Dublin European constituency . In Denmark, the Socialist People\'s Party (SF or Socialist Party for short) more than doubled its parliamentary representation to 23 seats from 11, making it the fourth largest party. [ 171 ] In 2011, the socialist parties of Social Democrats , Socialist People\'s Party and the Danish Social Liberal Party formed government, after a slight victory over the liberal parties. They were led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and had the Red-Green Alliance as a supporting party. \n In the UK, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers put forward a slate of candidates in the 2009 European Parliament elections under the banner of No to EU \xe2\x80\x93 Yes to Democracy , a broad left-wing alter-globalisation coalition involving socialist groups such as the Socialist Party , aiming to offer an alternative to the "anti-foreigner" and pro-business policies of the UK Independence Party . [ 172 ]  [ 173 ]  [ 174 ] In the following May 2010 UK general election, the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition , launched in January 2010 [ 175 ] and backed by Bob Crow, the leader of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT), other union leaders and the Socialist Party among other socialist groups, stood against Labour in 40 constituencies. [ 176 ]  [ 177 ] The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition plans to contest the 2011 elections, having gained the endorsement of the RMT June 2010 conference.

[ 188 ] \n Criticism of socialism \n Main article: Criticisms of socialism \n Economic liberals and pro-capitalist libertarians see private ownership of the means of production and the market exchange as natural entities or moral rights, which are central to their conceptions of freedom and liberty; they therefore perceive public ownership of the means of production, cooperatives and economic planning as infringements upon liberty. Some of the primary criticisms of socialism are claims that it creates distorted or absent price signals , [ 189 ]  [ 190 ] results in reduced incentives, [ 191 ]  [ 192 ]  [ 193 ] causes reduced prosperity, [ 194 ]  [ 195 ] has low feasibility, [ 189 ]  [ 190 ]  [ 196 ] and that it has negative social and political effects. [ 197 ]  [ 198 ]  [ 199 ]  [ 200 ]  [ 201 ] \n Critics from the neoclassical school of economics criticise state-ownership and centralisation of capital on the grounds that there is a lack of incentive in state institutions to act on information as efficiently as capitalist firms do because they lack hard budget constraints , resulting in reduced overall economic welfare for society. [ 202 ] Economists of the Austrian school argue that socialist systems based on economic planning are unfeasible because they lack the information to perform economic calculation in the first place, due to a lack of price signals and a free price system , which they argue are required for rational economic calculation.

There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology ... It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist.

Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm : "Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state--pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you\'ll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down; etc.)" \n ^  This definition is captured in this statement: Anthony Crosland "argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the Marxists , but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant."

It was almost impossible to get hold of copies of the IB in which I had written (I was only given one copy, for a branch of six members), whereas with the next IB, in which Ged Peck (I think his name was) rebutted my points, miraculously we received numerous copies. \n In the circumstances of the 1920s, given the same &#039;comrades&#039;, I&#039;d have received a bullet in the back of the head. This statement is not hyperbole: I seriously believe it. \n There&#039;s one good thing about the tens of thousands of workers who&#039;ve erroneously joined the SWP over the years because it was the most visible of the &#039;revolutionary&#039; (sic) parties, they&#039;ve all been inoculated against &#039;democratic centralism&#039;. \n And that joker Bambery thought I was a troublemaker or a busy!

The economy was characterised by state control of investment, public ownership of industrial assets, and during the last 20 years of its existence, pervasive corruption and socioeconomic stagnation. \n After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, continuing economic liberalisation moved the economy towards a market-oriented socialist economy . All of these factors contributed to the final dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The stagnation that would consume the last years of the Soviet Union was caused by poor governance under Leonid Brezhnev and inefficiencies within the planned economy . When the stagnation began is a matter of debate, but is normally placed either in the 1960s or early 1970s. \n Beginning in 1928, the entire course of the economy was guided by a series of Five-Year Plans . By the 1950s, the Soviet Union had, during the preceding few decades, evolved from a mainly agrarian society into a major industrial power. [ 14 ] Its transformative capacity\xe2\x80\x94what the United States National Security Council described as a "proven ability to carry backward countries speedily through the crisis of modernization and industrialization"\xe2\x80\x94meant communism consistently appealed to the intellectuals of developing countries in Asia. [ 15 ] Impressive growth rates during the first three Five-Year Plans (1928\xe2\x80\x9340) are particularly notable given that this period is nearly congruent with the Great Depression. [ 16 ] Nevertheless, the impoverished base upon which the Five-Year Plans sought to build meant that, at the commencement of Operation Barbarossa , the country was still poor. [ 17 ] While legitimate strictly in terms of growth and industrialisation, the death toll attributable to Stalinist economic development has been estimated at 10 million, much of which comprises famine victims . [ 18 ] \n The complex demands of the modern economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central planners. Corruption and data fiddling became common practice among the bureaucracy by reporting fulfilled targets and quotas, thus entrenching the crisis. Nonetheless, from the Stalin-era to the early Brezhnev-era, the Soviet economy grew much slower than Japan and slightly faster than the U.S. GDP levels in 1950 (in billion 1990 dollars) were 510 (100%) in the USSR, 161 (100%) in Japan and 1456 (100%) in the US. By 1965 the corresponding values were 1011 (198%), 587 (365%), and 2607 (179%). [ 19 ] \n The USSR\'s relatively small service sector accounted for just under 60% of the country\'s GDP in 1990, while the industrial and agricultural sectors contributed 21.9% and 20% respectively in 1991. Agriculture was the predominant occupation in the USSR before the massive industrialization under Joseph Stalin . The service sector was of low importance in the USSR, with the majority of the labor force employed in the industrial sector . The labor force totaled 152.3 million people. Major industrial products included petroleum, steel, motor vehicles, aerospace, telecommunications, chemicals, electronics, food processing, lumber, mining, and defense industry. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Planning \n \n 1.1 Drafting the five-year plans \n \n 1.1.1 Time frame \n 1.1.2 Guidelines for the plan \n 1.1.3 Gosplan \n 1.1.4 Planning ministries \n 1.1.5 Enterprises \n 1.1.6 Redrafting the plan \n 1.1.7 Approval of the plan \n 1.1.8 State budget \n \n \n \n \n 2 Agriculture \n 3 Foreign trade and currency \n 4 Forms of property \n \n 4.1 Individual property \n 4.2 Collective property \n \n \n 5 History \n \n 5.1 Early development \n 5.2 New Economic Policy (1921\xe2\x80\x939) \n 5.3 Stalinism \n 5.4 1930\xe2\x80\x931970 \n 5.5 1970\xe2\x80\x931990 \n \n \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n 8 Further reading \n \n 8.1 in Russian \n \n \n 9 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Planning \n Based on a system of state ownership, the Soviet economy was managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and the Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Beginning in 1928, the economy was directed by a series of five-year plans , with a brief attempt at seven-year planning. For every enterprise, planning ministries (also known as the "fund holders" or fondoderzhateli ) defined the mix of economic inputs (e.g., labor and raw materials), a schedule for completion, all wholesale prices and almost all retail prices . The planning process was based around material balances - balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally-planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process [ citation needed ] . \n Industry was long concentrated after 1928 on the production of capital goods through metallurgy , machine manufacture, and chemical industry. In Soviet terminology, the capital goods were known as group A goods , or means of production . This emphasis was based on the perceived necessity for a very fast industrialization and modernization of the Soviet Union. After the death of Stalin in 1953, consumer goods ( group B goods ) received more emphasis [ citation needed ] . For further details see consumer goods in the Soviet Union . \n Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down. There were several mechanisms in place for producers and consumers to provide input and information that would help in the drafting of economic plans (as detailed below), but the political climate was such that few people ever provided negative input or criticism of the plan [ citation needed ] . Thus, Soviet planners had very little reliable feedback that they could use to determine the success of their plans. This meant that economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages ( defitsit , \xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd1\x84\xd0\xb8\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82), while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Low-level managers often did not report such problems to their superiors, relying instead on each other for support. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts without the knowledge of the authorities and outside the parameters of the economic plan [ citation needed ] . \n Heavy industry was always the focus of the Soviet economy, even in its later years. The fact that it received special attention from the planners, combined with the fact that industrial production was relatively easy to plan even without minute feedback, led to significant growth in that sector. The Soviet Union became one of the leading industrial nations of the world. Industrial production was disproportionately high in the Soviet Union compared to Western economies. However, the production of consumer goods was disproportionately low. Economic planners made little effort to determine the wishes of household consumers, resulting in severe shortages of many consumer goods. Whenever these consumer goods would become available on the market, consumers routinely had to stand in long lines (queues) to buy them. [ citation needed ] A black market developed for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced (such as cigarettes ). \n \n See also : Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning . \n \n [ edit ] Drafting the five-year plans \n Under Stalin \'s tutelage, a complex system of planning arrangements had developed since the introduction of the first five-year plan in 1928. Until the late-1980s and early-1990s, when economic reforms backed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced significant changes in the traditional system ( see Perestroika ), the allocation of resources was directed by a planning apparatus rather than through the interplay of market forces. \n [ edit ] Time frame \n From the Joseph Stalin era through the late 1980s, the five-year plan integrated short-range planning into a longer time frame. It delineated the chief thrust of the country\'s economic development and specified the way the economy could meet the desired goals of the Communist Party . Although the five-year plan was enacted into law, it contained a series of guidelines rather than a set of direct orders. \n Periods covered by the five-year plans coincided with those covered by the gatherings of the CPSU Party Congress . At each CPSU Congress, the party leadership presented the targets for the next five-year plan. Thus, each plan had the approval of the most authoritative body of the country\'s leading political institution. \n [ edit ] Guidelines for the plan \n The Central Committee of the CPSU and, more specifically, its Politburo , set basic guidelines for planning. The Politburo determined the general direction of the economy via control figures (preliminary plan targets), major investment projects (capacity creation), and general economic policies. These guidelines were submitted as a report of the Central Committee to the Congress of the CPSU to be approved there. \n After the approval at the congress, the list of priorities for the five-year plan was processed by the Council of Ministers , which constituted the government of the USSR. The Council of Ministers was composed of industrial ministers, chairmen of various state committees, and chairmen of agencies with ministerial status. This committee stood at the apex of the vast economic administration, including the state planning apparatus, the industrial ministries, the trusts (the intermediate level between the ministries and the enterprises), and finally, the state enterprises. The Council of Ministers elaborated on Politburo plan targets and sent them to Gosplan, which gathered data on plan fulfillment. \n [ edit ] Gosplan \n Main article: Gosplan \n Combining the broad goals laid out by the Council of Ministers with data supplied by lower administrative levels regarding the current state of the economy, Gosplan worked out, through trial and error, a set of preliminary plan targets. Among more than twenty state committees, Gosplan headed the government\'s planning apparatus and was by far the most important agency in the economic administration. The task of planners was to balance resources and requirements to ensure that the necessary inputs were provided for the planned output. The planning apparatus alone was a vast organizational arrangement consisting of councils, commissions, governmental officials, specialists, etc. charged with executing and monitoring economic policy. \n The state planning agency was subdivided into its own industrial departments, such as coal , iron , and machine building. It also had summary departments such as finance , dealing with issues that crossed functional boundaries. With the exception of a brief experiment with regional planning during the Khrushchev era in the 1950s, Soviet planning was done on a sectoral basis rather than on a regional basis. The departments of the state planning agency aided the agency\'s development of a full set of plan targets along with input requirements, a process involving bargaining between the ministries and their superiors. \n [ edit ] Planning ministries \n Economic ministries performed key roles in the Soviet organizational structure. When the planning goals had been established by Gosplan , economic ministries drafted plans within their jurisdictions and disseminated planning data to the subordinate enterprises. The planning data were sent downward through the planning hierarchy for progressively more detailed elaboration. The ministry received its control targets, which were then disaggregated by branches within the ministry, then by lower units, eventually until each enterprise received its own control figures (production targets). \n [ edit ] Enterprises \n Enterprises were called upon to develop in the final period of state planning in the late-1980s and early-1990s (even though such participation was mostly limited to a rubber-stamping of prepared statements during huge pre-staged meetings). The enterprises\' draft plans were then sent back up through the planning ministries for review. This process entailed intensive bargaining, with all parties seeking the target levels and input figures that best suited their interests. \n [ edit ] Redrafting the plan \n After this bargaining process, Gosplan received the revised estimates and re-aggregated them as it saw fit. Then, the redrafted plan was sent to the Council of Ministers and the Party\'s Politburo and Central Committee Secretariat for approval. The Council of Ministers submitted the Plan to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee submitted the plan to the Party Congress, both for rubber stamp approval. By this time, the process had been completed and the plan became law. \n [ edit ] Approval of the plan \n The review, revision, and approval of the five-year plan were followed by another downward flow of information, this time with the amended and final plans containing the specific targets for each sector of the economy. Implementation began at this point, and was largely the responsibility of enterprise managers. \n [ edit ] State budget \n The national state budget was prepared by the Ministry of Finance of the USSR by negotiating with its all-Union local organizations. If the state budget was accepted by the Soviet Union , to then get adopted. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Agriculture \n Main article: Agriculture in the Soviet Union \n Agriculture was organized into a system of collective farms ( kolkhozes ) and state farms ( sovkhozes ). Organized on a large scale and highly mechanized, the Soviet Union was one of the world\'s leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a record harvest followed by another drop in overall production in 1979 and 1980 back to levels attained in 1975. Cotton , sugar beets , potatoes , and flax were also major crops. \n However, despite immense land resources, extensive machinery and chemical industries, and a large rural work force, Soviet agriculture was relatively unproductive, [ original research? ] hampered in many areas by the climate (only 10 percent of the Soviet Union\'s land was arable), and poor worker productivity since the collectivization in the 1930s. [ citation needed ] Lack of transport infrastructure also caused much waste. \n A view of poor performance of Soviet collective farms is provided by two historians, M. Heller and A. Nekich ("Utopia in Power, History of the Soviet Union from 1917 to Present," Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1986). The authors report that in 1979, 28% of the Soviet agricultural production was from small plots of private citizens, which represented less than 1% of the cultivated land. So according to them, collective farms operated very inefficiently. \n [ edit ] Foreign trade and currency \n Main article: Foreign trade of the Soviet Union \n Largely self-sufficient, the Soviet Union traded little in comparison to its economic strength. However, trade with noncommunist countries increased in the 1970s as the government sought to compensate gaps in domestic production with imports. \n In general, fuels , metals , and timber were exported. Machinery , consumer goods , and sometimes grain were imported. In the 1980s trade with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) member states accounted for about half the country\'s volume of trade. Although often associated with alcohol production, such as that of vodka , none of these were leading Soviet exports. \n The Soviet currency (ruble) was non-convertible after 1932 (when trade in gold-convertible " chervonets ", introduced by Lenin in NEP years, was suspended) until the late eighties. It was impossible (both for citizens and state-owned businesses) to freely buy or sell foreign currency even though the "exchange rate" was set and published regularly. Buying or selling foreign currency on a black market was a serious crime until the late eighties. Individuals who were paid from abroad (for example writers whose books were published abroad) normally had to spend their currency in a foreign-currency-only chain of state-owned " Beryozka " ("Birch-tree") stores. Once a free conversion of currency was allowed, the exchange rate plummeted from its official values by almost a factor of 10. \n Overall, the banking system was highly centralized and fully controlled by a single state-owned Gosbank , responsive to the fulfillment of the government\'s economic plans. Soviet banks furnished short-term credit to state-owned enterprises. \n [ edit ] Forms of property \n There were two basic forms of property in the Soviet Union: individual property and collective property. These differed greatly in their content and legal status. According to communist theory, capital ( means of production ) should not be individually owned, with certain negligible exceptions. In particular, after the end of a short period of the New Economic Policy and with collectivization completed, all industrial property and virtually all land were collective. \n Land in rural areas was allotted for housing and some sustenance farming, and persons had certain rights to it, but it was not their property in full. In particular, in kolkhozes and sovkhozes there was a practice to rotate individual farming lots with collective lots. This resulted in situations where people would ameliorate , till and cultivate their lots carefully, adapting them to small-scale farming, and in 5\xe2\x80\x937 years those lots would be swapped for kolkhoz ones, typically with exhausted soil due to intensive, large-scale agriculture. There was an extremely small number of remaining individual farmsteads ( khutors \xd1\x85\xd1\x83\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd1\x80), located in isolated rural areas in the Baltic states , Ukraine , Siberia and cossack lands. \n [ edit ] Individual property \n To distinguish "capitalist" and "socialist" types of property ownership further, two different forms of individual property were recognized: private property ( \xd1\x87\xd0\xb0\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , chastnaya sobstvennost) and personal property ( \xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x87\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , lichnaya sobstvennost). The former encompassed capital (means of production), while the latter described everything else in a person\'s possession. This distinction has been a source of confusion when interpreting phrases such as "socialism (communism) abolished private property" ; one might conclude that all individual property was abolished, when this was in fact not the case [ citation needed ] . \n [ edit ] Collective property \n There were several forms of collective ownership, the most significant being state property , kolkhoz property , and cooperative property . The most common forms of cooperative property were housing cooperatives (\xd0\xb6\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x89\xd0\xbd\xd1\x8b\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb2\xd1\x8b) in urban areas, consumer cooperatives (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f, \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f), and rural consumer societies (\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb0, \xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe). \n [ edit ] History \n [ edit ] Early development \n Both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later, the Soviet Union , were countries in the process of industrialization . For both, this development occurred slowly and from a low initial starting point. Because of World War I , the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Russian Civil War industrial production had only managed to barely recover its 1913 level by 1926. [ 21 ] By this time about 18% of the population lived in non-rural areas, although only about 7.5% were employed in the non-agricultural sector. The remainder were stuck in the low productivity agriculture. [ 22 ] \n According to David A. Dyker , the Soviet Union of the 1930s can be regarded as a typical developing country, characterized by low capital investment and most of its population resident in the countryside. Part of the reason for low investment rates lay in the inability to acquire capital from abroad. This in turn, was the result of the repudiation of the debts of the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks , as well as the world wide financial troubles. Consequently, any kind of economic growth had to be financed by domestic savings. [ 22 ] \n The economic problems in agriculture were further acerbated by natural conditions, such as long cold winters across the country, droughts in the south and acidic soils in the north. However, according to Dyker, the Soviet economy did have "extremely good" potential in the area of raw materials and mineral extraction, for example in the oil fields in Transcaucasia , and this, along with a small but growing manufacturing base, helped the USSR avoid any kind of balance of payments problems. [ 22 ] \n [ edit ] New Economic Policy (1921\xe2\x80\x939) \n Main article: New Economic Policy \n \n \n \n  \nThe two major economic policy makers of the USSR, Lenin (left) created the NEP while Stalin (right) created the planned economy \n \n \n By early 1921 it became apparent to the Bolsheviks that forced requisitioning of grain had resulted in low agricultural production and widespread opposition. As a result, the decision was made by Lenin and the Politburo to try an alternative approach. [ 23 ] The so-called New Economic Policy (NEP) was approved at the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) [ 24 ] \n Everything except "the commanding heights", as Lenin put it, of the economy would be privatized . "The commanding heights" included foreign trade , heavy industry , communication and transport among others. [ 23 ] In practice this limited the private sector to artisan and agricultural production/trade. [ 25 ] The NEP encountered strong resistance within the Bolshevik party. Lenin had to persuade communist skeptics that " state capitalism " was a necessary step in achieving communism , while he himself harbored suspicions that the policy could be abused by private businessmen (" NEPmen "). [ 26 ] \n As novelist Andrei Platonov , among others, noted, the improvements were immediate. Rationing cards and queues, which had become hallmarks of war communism , had disappeared. However, due to prolonged war, low harvests, and several natural disasters the Soviet economy was still in trouble, particularly its agricultural sector. In 1921 widespread famine broke out in the Volga-Ural region . The Soviet government changed its previous course and allowed international relief to come in from abroad, and established a special committee chaired by prominent communists and non-communists alike. Despite this, an estimated five million people died in the famine. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Stalinism \n Starting in 1928, the five-year plans began building a heavy industrial base at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. The country now became industrialized at a hitherto unprecedented pace, surpassing Germany \'s pace of industrialization in the 19th century and Japan \'s earlier in the 20th century. \n After the reconstruction of the economy (in the wake of the destruction caused by the Russian Civil War ) was completed, and after the initial plans of further industrialisation were fulfilled, the explosive growth slowed down, but still generally surpassed most of the other countries in terms of total material production ( GNP ) [ citation needed ] until the period of Brezhnev stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s. \n Led by the creation of NAMI , and by the GAZ copy of the Ford Model A in 1929, [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] industrialization came with the extension of medical services, which improved labor productivity . Campaigns were carried out against typhus , cholera , and malaria ; the number of physicians increased as rapidly as facilities and training would permit; and death and infant mortality rates steadily decreased. \n [ edit ] 1930\xe2\x80\x931970 \n \n \n \n  \nThe State Quality Mark of the USSR , introduced in 1967, was used to certify that goods met quality standards, and to improve the efficiency of production \n \n \n As weighed growth rates, economic planning performed very well during the early and mid-1930s, World War II -era mobilization, and for the first two decades of the postwar era. The Soviet Union became the world\'s leading producer of oil , coal , iron ore , and cement ; manganese , gold , natural gas and other minerals were also of major importance. However, information about the Soviet famine of 1932\xe2\x80\x931933 was suppressed by the Soviet authorities until perestroika . In 1933 workers\' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level. [ 30 ] Common and political prisoners in labor camps were forced to do unpaid labor, and communists and Komsomol members were frequently "mobilized" for various construction projects. \n The German invasion of World War II inflicted punishing blows to the economy of the USSR, with Soviet GDP falling 34% between 1940 and 1942. [ 31 ] Industrial output did not recover to its 1940 level for almost a decade. [ 18 ] \n In 1961, a new redenominated Soviet ruble was issued. It maintained exchange parity with the Pound Sterling until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. After a new leadership, headed by Leonid Brezhnev , had come to power, attempts were made to revitalize the economy through economic reform . Starting in 1965, enterprises and organizations were made to rely on economic methods of profitable production, rather than follow orders from the state administration. By 1970, the Soviet economy had reached its zenith and was estimated at about 60 percent of the size of the USA [ citation needed ] in terms of the estimated commodities (like steel and coal). In 1989, the GDP of the Soviet Union was $2,500 Billion [ 32 ] while the GDP of the United States was $4,862 Billion [ 33 ] with per capita income figures as $8,700 and $19,800 respectively. \n \n \n \n  \n \n This article\'s factual accuracy is disputed .

Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR\'s GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. [ citation needed ] The Soviet planned economy was not structured to respond adequately to the demands of the complex modern economy it had helped to forge. The massive quantities of goods produced often did not meet the needs or tastes of consumers. [ 34 ] The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. During 1975\xe2\x80\x9385, corruption and data fiddling became common practice among bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas thus entrenching the crisis. \n Awareness of the growing crisis arose initially within the KGB which with its extensive network of informants in every region and institution had its finger on the pulse of the nation. Yuri Andropov , director of the KGB, created a secret department during the 1970s within the KGB devoted to economic analysis, and when he succeeded Brezhnev in 1982 sounded the alarm forcefully to the Soviet leadership. Andropov\'s remedy of increased discipline, however, proved ineffective. It was only when Andropov\'s protege Gorbachev assumed power that a determined, but ultimately unsuccessful, assault on the economic crisis was undertaken.

It allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. \r\n    Today, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson, who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. In April, Bharara accused Democratic Sen. Malcolm Smith of Queens of trying to bribe his way onto the Republican line to run for New York City mayor. Smith denies the charge and state Republican Chairman Ed Cox said his party would never have accepted Smith. \r\n    Now, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to dismantle Wilson-Pakula. He wants to take away the power of party chairmen to grant waivers allowing an insider onto the party line. Instead, Cuomo wants to require a petition process that would require broader political support by party members, which some minor parties already offer. \r\n    "You have heard the expression \'pay to play\'?" Cuomo said, referring to the practice in which lobbyists make campaign donations to get or stop legislation. "This is \'pay to run.\' \r\n    "The allegation is that the minor parties basically, on occasion, have used campaign contributions to determine who gets the line," Cuomo said. "It\'s almost that the line goes to the highest bidder." \r\n    The Independent Democratic Conference, which shares majority control of the Senate with Republicans, also supports repeal. \r\n     FILE - In this Dec. 18, 1973 file photo, with his hand on the Bible, Lt. Gov. Malcolm Wilson takes the oath of office in New York State\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s Capitol in Albany, N.Y. There is a law in New York state that allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Wilson, who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. (AP Photo/Hoy, File) Wilson-Pakula, however, is being defended by the unlikeliest band of liberals, conservatives, moderates and disenfranchised voters equally disgusted by the Democratic and Republican parties. They note eliminating the power of a party\'s top leader to block a candidate gives more power to the Democratic and Republican parties through infiltrating operatives to control or silence minority parties and their voices. \r\n    Supporters pose a scenario in which a wealthy candidate &mdash; for example, a conservative &mdash; could organize enough supporters to infiltrate a minor party of liberals and collect votes from liberals who assumed the candidate shared their values. The next step, supporters portend, would include Republicans and Democrats infiltrating the opposition party, resulting in two parties indistinguishable from each other or, worse, a de facto single party. \r\n    "We respectfully disagree with anyone who wants to change the Wilson-Pakula law," said Frank MacKay, chairman of the state Independence Party. "Without Wilson-Pakula, a wealthy candidate could override the philosophy of a party which he has nothing in common with." \r\n    On this, many liberals and conservatives agree. \r\n    "Hey, I don\'t like the Working Families Party," said state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long. "But they stand for a set of principles and enunciate a set of principles. ... We feel this is important for this nation. It would really end a philosophical bent to political parties in New York." \r\n    The liberal Working Families Party agrees. \r\n    "The governor\'s proposal will cause a tremendous amount of confusion and chaos among voters and is a direct attack on the rights of minor parties to be effective participants in New York politics," said Dan Cantor, executive director of the party. \r\n    "We know a lot of people vote on our line and we know a lot don\'t. But they\'ve come to rely on our line meaning something," Cantor said. "The governor is trying to make ideas even less important in politics. And that\'s a bad thing." \r\n    The Green Party, another liberal force, calls efforts to repeal Wilson-Pakula an assault on the First Amendment and a move that would make well-funded candidates even more powerful. Cuomo has more than $20 million in his campaign fund and the Democratic line in a state dominated nearly 2-to-1 by Democratic voters. He has no need to run on a minor party line, but for his Republican opponent, additional lines will be essential. \r\n    "Cuomo and the Independent Democratic Conference aren\'t interested in preventing corruption," said Gloria Mattera, co-chairwoman of the Green Party. "They just want to further weaken political parties and make it easier for the candidates with the most money to buy elections." \n\n \n \n Think your friends should see this?

When the term &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; is used as a synonym for the political system of the old Soviet Union and the Soviet satellite states ruled by various Communist parties, the &ldquo;C&rdquo; is capitalized. \r\n \r\nMarxist doctrine holds that just as society evolved from feudalism to capitalism, it will inexorably progress still further to socialism and eventually communism. Communists consider socialism to be an intermediary step between capitalism (out of which socialism is said to grow) and communism. That is, communism (whose motto is &ldquo;From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs &rdquo;) is deemed a further development, or &ldquo;higher stage,&rdquo; of socialism (whose motto is &ldquo;From each according to his ability, to each according to his deeds &rdquo;). Communism, in other words, is viewed as the more &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; of two systems that both advocate public ownership of the means of production, centralized economic planning, and the widespread redistribution of wealth. \r\n \r\nThe socialist principle of distribution according to deeds, or the quality and quantity of work that people perform, stands in marked contrast to the communist principle of distribution according to people&rsquo;s needs. The former, because it accepts deed-based distribution of wealth, is considered easier to implement in a capitalist society without large-scale overhauls of existing political and economic structures. In essence, socialists view capitalism as a viable economic mechanism whose reins must simply be transferred from the currently dominant &ldquo;oppressor class&rdquo; that misuses capitalism to exploit workers, into the hands of the &ldquo;worker class&rdquo; which could use the system for laudable ends. \r\n \r\nCommunists, unlike socialists, believe that capitalism cannot be subtly incorporated into a new, egalitarian economic order; that it cannot be used as a convenient means to a more desirable end. Rather, communists call for the annihilation of capitalism by revolutionary means. They exhort the working classes to overthrow the &ldquo;capitalist dictatorship&rdquo; and to establish a classless society by force -- using armed strength to utterly vanquish the existing &ldquo;ruling class.&rdquo; \r\n \r\nThe RESOURCES column located on the right side of this page contains links to articles, essays, books, and videos that explore such topics as:\r\n \r\n \r\n\t the worldviews and objectives of communism and socialism; \r\n\t the history and evolution of communist and socialist ideas, as well as the history of the real-world implementation of those ideas; \r\n\t the concept of cultural Marxism, more commonly known as &quot;political correctness&quot;; \r\n\t socialism in the United States; \r\n\t the collaboration between American and British intelligence agencies \r\n\tthat decoded Soviet spy transmissions during the World War II era; \r\n\t how Hollywood has become a bastion of leftist, socialist, and communist \r\n\tleanings -- a development that has greatly influenced the nature of the \r\n\tmovies that the entertainment world's leading actors and producers make; \r\n\t the immense harm that communism has inflicted on the populations living under its rule; \r\n\t important books for those who wish to educate themselves about the history, ideals, and goals of communism and socialism; \r\n\t the text, message, and influence of a number of communism's seminal writings; \r\n\t the phenomenon of &quot;McCarthyism&quot; and its lasting legacy; and \r\n\t the relationship between communism and the genocidal objectives of Palestinian extremists; and \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n    \r\n   \r\n  \r\n\t \r\n  \r\n\t\t \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   IN DEPTH \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\t\t \r\n\r\n Nature and Goals of Communism / Socialism \r\n\t\r\n Historical Perspectives \r\n\t\r\n Political Correctness / Cultural Marxism \r\n\t\r\n Socialism in the United States \r\n\t\r\n Venona Project, Mitrokhin Archives, & Soviet Espionage \r\n\t\r\n Hollywood and Communism/Socialism \r\n\t\r\n Results of Communism / Socialism \r\n\t\r\n Bibliographies and Guides to Literature \r\n\t\r\n Major Communist Texts \r\n\t\r\n McCarthyism, Red Scare, and Domestic Subversion \r\n\t\r\n Communist Roots of Palestinian Terror \r\n\t\r\n\t\t \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\t \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    BOOKS \r\n   \r\n* For recommended books on this topic, click here. \r\n \r\n \r\n         \r\n VIDEOS \r\n \r\n* For recommended videos on this topic, click here. \r\n \r\n\r\n   \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\t Sign up to get &quot;Featured Profiles&quot; from DTN: \r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n \r\n\r\n Click here to view a sample Profile. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Since Feb 14, 2005 --Hits: 61,630,061 --Visitors: 7,024,052  \r\n Copyright 2003-2012 : DiscoverTheNetworks.org"

S'Communism vs Socialism - Difference and Comparison | Diffen \n   \n   \n    \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  \n   Communism vs Socialism \n     \n    Diffen \xe2\x80\xba      \n      Economics \n        \n     \n   In a way, communism is an extreme form of socialism . Many countries have dominant socialist political parties but very few are truly communist. In fact, most countries - including staunch capitalist bastions like the U.S. and U.K. - have government programs that borrow from socialist principles. " Socialism " is sometimes used interchangeably with " communism " but the two philosophies have some stark differences. Most notably, while communism is a political system, socialism is primarily an economic system that can exist in various forms under a wide range of political systems.\n \n\t\t Comparison chart \n   \n    \n     \n      \n      Communism \n      Socialism \n     \n    \n    Philosophy:     From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

Emphasis on profit being distributed among the society or workforce in addition to receiving a wage. \n     Definition:     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the community or state \n     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of most property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the workers \n     Political System:     No leader, directed directly by the people. This has never been actually practiced, and has just used a one-party system. \n     Multiple parties, but the ruling party usually goes by the name &quot;Socialist&quot;. \n     Social Structure:     All class distinctions are eliminated. \n     Class distinctions are diminished \n     Economic System:     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given equal shares of the benefits derived from labor. All means of production are controlled by the state. \n     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given somewhat equal shares of the benefits derived from labor, but people can earn more if they work harder. Means of production are controlled by the workers themselves. \n     Free Choice:     In real communism, where a leader does not exist, everything is chosen freely.In those that have been practiced though, all choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are controlled by the state. \n     All choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are up to the individual. All health care and education is provided free to everybody \n     Ideas:     Human societies have always been divided into warring classes. The Industrial Revolution has enriched the wealthy and impoverished the poor. The workers must overthrow the bourgeois. \n     All people should be given an equal opportunity to succeed. Workers should have most say in their factory\'s management. The free market suffers from problems like tragedy of the commons. Government regulation is necessary. \n     Private Property:     Abolished \n     two kinds of property, private property, such as land, houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. Public property, factories, and means of production owned by the state but with worker control \n     Religion:     Abolished. \n     freedom of religion \n     Economic Coordination:     Government controls all business, as well as Business decisions. \n     Planned-Socialism relies principally on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralized or decentralized. Market-socialism relies on markets for allocating capital to different socially-owned enterprises. \n     Discrimination:     In theory, all members of the state are considered equal \n     The people are considered equal, laws are made when necessary to protect people from discrimination \n     Political Movements:     Leninism, Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, Left-Communism \n     Democratic Socialism, Communism, Libertarian Socialism, Anarchism, Syndicalism \n     Key elements:     An enhanced form of the principle of &quot;Production for use&quot;. \n     Economic activity and production especially are adjusted to meet human needs and economic demands. &quot;Production for use&quot;: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. \n     Ownership structure:     The means of production are commonly-owned, meaning no entity or individual owns productive property. Importance is ascribed to &quot;usership&quot; over &quot;ownership&quot;. \n     The means of production are socially-owned with the surplus value produced accruing to either all of society (in Public-ownership models) or to all the employee-members of the enterprise (in Cooperative-ownership models). \n     Key Proponents:     Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky \n     Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Emma Goldman \n     Means of control:     Proletariat engages in violent rebellion. \n     Proletariat engages in taking charge of the factories and means of production. \n     Variations:     Include Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism \n     libertarian-socialism, and anarcho-socialism, anarcho-syndicalism \n     Way of Change:     Government in a Communist-state is the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by government can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     Workers in a Socialist-state are the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by the workers can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     \n\n\n \n\t\t Contents \n \n 1 Economic differences between socialists and communists \n 2 Political differences \n 3 Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n 4 Related Articles \n 5 References \n   Economic differences between socialists and communists \n In a Socialist economy, the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy. On the other hand, in a communist society, there is no centralized government - there is a collective ownership of property and the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.\n For a Capitalist society to transition, the first step is Socialism. From a capitalist system, it is easier to achieve the Socialist ideal where production is distributed according to people\'s deeds (quantity and quality of work done). For Communism (to distribute production according to needs ), it is necessary to first have production so high that there is enough for everyone\'s needs. In an ideal Communist society, people work not because they have to but because they want to and out of a sense of responsibility .\n \n  Political differences \n Socialism rejects a class-based society. But socialists believe that it is possible to make the transition from capitalism to socialism without a basic change in the character of the state. They hold this view because they do not think of the capitalist state as essentially an institution for the dictatorship of the capitalist class, but rather as a perfectly good piece of machinery which can be used in the interest of whichever class gets command of it. No need, then, for the working class in power to smash the old capitalist state apparatus and set up its own\xe2\x80\x94the march to socialism can be made step by step within the framework of the democratic forms of the capitalist state. Socialism is primarily an economic system so it exists in varying degrees and forms in a wide variety of political systems.\n On the other hand, communists believe that as soon as the working class and its allies are in a position to do so they must make a basic change in the character of the state; they must replace capitalist dictatorship over the working class with workers\xe2\x80\x99 dictatorship over the capitalist class as the first step in the process by which the existence of capitalists as a class (but not as individuals) is ended and a classless society is eventually ushered in.\n \n  Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n This is a very opinionated video that explains the differences between communism and socialism.\n \n \n  Related Articles \n Capitalism vs Socialism \n Liberal vs Conservative \n Democrat vs Republican \n Communism vs Fascism \n Communism vs Democracy \n \n  References \n http://www.marxmail.org/faq/socialism_and_communism.htm \n http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/faq/commievssoc.html \n http://www.romm.org/soc_com.html \n http://www.pww.org/past-weeks-1999/Socialism%20and%20communism.htm \n \n   \n    \n         \n     Comments: Communism vs Socialism \n     Comment anonymously \n      Anonymous comments     \n     Socialists has been in america since the late 1800s and has played an important role in organizing strikes and unions in the country. With out them there may have been a lot more starving people during the great depression \n     165.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.67 on 2013-04-17 12:24:25 \n         \n     to the guy who said why socialism aka communism doesn\'t work.\r\n\r\nSocialism and communism are not at all the same thing as they differ in many ways. A socialism has never existed. as a true socialism is one that the government fully regulates major companies and still lets there be private industry still alive to allow growth as well as the stability of a well controlled industry \n     209.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.251 on 2013-03-20 14:48:58 \n         \n     All of you ignore the basic instincts of human nature. If any of you would understand that, you would also understand why socialism aka communism simply does not work and is simply an utopia. Acording to marx, capitalism unevitably will lead to socialism, and socialism to communism. Is like fore play and sex, one lead to the other. At least thats how it was suposed to be through marx\'s eyes. Yes, there is a socialist tendency in this country, is been here ever since the 50\'s if I\'m not mistaken. Just take a look back and see the violent manifestations in the past of socialist suporters in this country. Marx also promotes that. When it became a big deal to identifie oneself as socialist in this country, and the socialist party went under ground, its members went under the umbrela of the democratic party, and were forced to change their estrategy. now they are tring to indoctrinate kids in schools and universities whith out them even noticing what they are being indoctrinated with. For all of you that want to know about marxism, you need to get your hands on marx and engels books and read them. Then see how such line of thinking have worked in the past for socialist and communist countries and how is working for europe, which is on the verge of total bankrupcy and economic desaster. Also check how is working for this country. Do you see total disaster coming for this country should socialists continue to get a hold to the government? I do. Is just a mater of time. Wake up and be realistic and pragmatic. because of our very nature, it is totaly impossible to have a socialist sistem all perfect as discribed by marx utopia, because we are all corrupt. Power corrupts. Capitalism may not be perfect, even corrupt if you will, but is, with out room for doubts, the best sistem there is and this great nation speaks loudly to that reality. Socialism aka communism(is all the same thing) takes everything away from the rich and turns the poor into a slave. socialism paves the road for totalitarism in time. I know, for I,ve lived it and studied it; very well indoctrinated with marx and engels books and dialectical materialism. As far as I\'m concerned I would domp all of marx books in the septic tank for what they are worth. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.6 on 2013-02-28 04:29:29 \n         \n     To the person in \'Anonymous Comments\' who said, &quot;liberals don\'t want to see the poor get education&quot;. Are you kidding me? What country do you live in? Remember it\'s the liberals/left who fight for everyone to have an equal chance at education.\r\nIt\'s the right/Repubs who stop at nothing to prevent any sort of funding to assist people to help them get better education!\r\nHave you been smoking dope or something? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:43:21 \n         \n     Indeed, there has never been a true communist state. Remember, in true communism everyone is equal across the board. But in every so called communist country certain members of society received special favor ... in the USSR you got a bigger apartment if you were an Olympic star for example. That is not communism.\r\nBottom line, there has never been any true pure form of any communism, socialism or capitalism based country ever.\r\nIn America it\'s schools, mail system, police and fire departments are all forms of socialism.\r\nThese numbskulls who scream that Obama is a Nazi Socialist or Communist haven\'t a clue. Yet at the same time scream &quot;if you don\'t believe like me... you\'re un-American&quot; and &quot;my country right OR wrong&quot;. If anything these types of viewpoints that most right-wingers have are exactly the types that helped fuel the Nazi movement in Germany. How ironic ( read, scary) is that? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:30:12 \n         \n     Socialistic ideologies aren\'t as bad as you would think. I believe that one if the first societies to use it was the Roman Empire. They flourished under socialist ideas. I\'m not saying the country should be 100% socialist, but rather take some ideologies and put them to work in our society. \n     107.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.178 on 2013-01-01 14:47:07 \n         \n     Disgusting analysis performed by undereducated American sychophants. Communism produces a stateless society.There is no government, no currency, nothing of the nature of capitalist economics. The reason you have no understanding of it is that you attempt to put it under economic models ascribed to analyze capitalism. You cannot say that there is a single party in communism, because communism has no government. \n     76.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.33 on 2012-10-02 20:51:51 \n         \n     Of course, capitalism hampers the freedoms of everybody except the capitalist class just as much as the other systems; people work because they have to, their jobs are largely determined by economic mandates, not personal preference, and without stringent regulations, human rights abuses are as common and as severe as in communism. No system is perfect. \n     168.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.19 on 2012-06-21 04:01:27 \n         \n     Our republic should provide basic laws that generally protect the public harm, Capitalism provides the greatest freedom, who among us want to give up our free will to another man, not I. Every step away from capitalism to a socialistic/communistic system is simply tranferring some degree of our our freedom to another person or group and a step toward human rights violations that are prevalent in places like China (slavery). \r\n\r\nHuman nature dictates that individuals will prefer freedom over the other systems if they are educated to know the difference, this is why liberals prefer the poor don\'t get a useful education hence inner city grades. \r\n\r\nSome people will never be a doctor because the are either not smart enough or are not interested or generally does not suit that person, yet due to their individual likes may become very succsseful in ways no one could predict much less some bureaucrat. \n     70.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.158 on 2012-06-02 14:47:25 \n         \n     You have got this completely wrong Trotsky was a socialist you make socialism sound weak well it is not we believe in all the ideals you put forward for\r\nCommunism \n     86.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.215 on 2012-05-07 22:08:31 \n         \n     On 3/26/11 there was a comment that the free market system nearly brought down the world economy in 2008. I beg to differ! There are many who, through the propaganda spread by the left wing main stream media, believe that the present economic woes of the US and world are to be blamed on the Republicans and Capitalists. The problem started with the collapse of the mortgage industry which was brought on by our government sticking its nose into the free market system. As Republicans in congress were warning of the dangers of the subprime mortgage loans that were being made in 2008 and earlier, Barney Frank stood before the House and insisted that it was&quot;WORTH THE RISK&quot; to get more minorities into their own homes ----- whether or not they were credit worthy! Too many today want to blame the banks, forgetting that it was the government who twisted the arms of the banks to make these risky loans under the threat of hefty penalties if they did not comply. They forget that Obama himself, working for ACORN, sued Citibank over this very issue and Citibank caved in due to laws that had been put in place by an over-reaching Federal Government. And besides, the banks were safe as the risk was really being put on Fanny and Freddie -----THE TAX PAYERS! The banks, left to their own business wisdom would never have engaged in such shaky practices. It was the fault of the Democratic left wing Socialists, playing up to their base and trying to garner support, who believed that they should &quot;spread the wealth&quot;. Obama has often said that he inherited this economy from Bush but Bush was not running Congress ----- it was being run by the Democrat majority. Then the Morons in this country voted in the very people who caused the economic crash in the first place. There will always be the rich and the poor because there will always be the industrious and the slackers. Socialism/Communism always fails. Look at the Plymouth Plantation in 1620. They nearly died from starvation under communism and only prospered when they shifted to &quot;every man for himself&quot;. The Soviet Union collapsed because their economic engine had the constant drag of apathy caused by hopelessness ----- lack of opportunity to prosper. They could not compete with our economic engine ------ capitalism. Look at what is happening to the economies of Europe ------ they\'re imploding ------ too much consumption and not enough production. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.237 on 2012-01-02 01:43:09 \n         \n     Socialism is communism with lipstick on and is the stepping stone of losing your rights of proprietorship. Thats right,no more owning your own business or private property. Opportunities to Free Market Capitalism will be annihalated and there will be no more poor,middle or rich class people. The Socialists and Communists will tell you that its the best society and there will be no more racism or poverty.Try telling that to the 4.5 million people in the U.S.S.R who lost there lives as a direct result of Karl Marx\' &quot;Utopia&quot;. You would have to be a blithering idiot to co-sign on any form of socialism or communism. Capitalism may not be perfect but nothing on Planet Earth is,everything has pros and cons. There will always be greed,people who are homeless and hungry. At least Free Market Capitalism gives us an opportunity to become what we want to instead of having it dictated to us. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.138 on 2011-07-27 22:24:33 \n         \n     A Republic isn\'t the freest from of government! The freest is total anarchy or total democracy. A republic has representatives to make decision for the people. Even though they are chosen by the people that doesn\'t mean they\'re decisions reflect exactly what every person they represent wants. Anarchy has no rules whatsoever so total freedom, Democracy has everyone vote on every decision so nearly total freedom. Also no one compares Communism and Socialism with a republic because they are not on the same field. A republic is how a government is run. Communism, Capitalism, Fascism are how business is run by in the country (sometimes they r views too). Liberal, Conservative are views(also parties) of how the current government system should make decisions. So for example the US is a mix of Republic and Democracy, with Capitalism, and the two parties. The USSR was totalitarian and Communist. Also Rome and China both call themselves republics, which they were once, but we no that changed. \n     173.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.199 on 2011-05-19 00:15:32 \n         \n     One common trait shared between communism and socialism is the significant absence of freedom of choice among the individuals. I like how some try to focus the comparison of communism and socialism with capitalism rather than making the comparison with a Republic form of government. A Republic is by far offers the most freedom to individuals and the protection of individuals rights. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.150 on 2011-05-15 03:19:56 \n         \n     All of you who rave on the glory of capitalism and how it\'s the only structure that has \'worked\' seem to conveniently FORGET how the free market system virtually brought down the world in 1929 and 2008 (or the next crash that just may be the end of life as you lavishly and richly know it). And you seem to neglect all the greed, crime and corruption due to capitalism. Do you really think that a relatively young system like captialism will succeed forever? There has been no political/economical structure that has stood the test of time - they all fall for one reason or another. Do you really believe the few \'haves\' will continue to rule over the numerous \'have-nots\' because it\'s such a wonderful system? Just wait, it wont be much longer now. But there might be a better way...a blend of the best of all three systems. PS&gt; just the other day I told someone that I think Palin is the antichrist!! \n     71.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.59 on 2011-03-26 07:21:50 \n         \n     A difference between communism and socialism that i\'ve noticed is that communism usually has a dictator (i think this was started by Stalin, i don\'t see Lenin as a dictator) and socialism is intended to be democratic (as Marx wanted, don\'t remember if today\'s socialist countries were or not). With a dictatorship its easier to have more problems by getting a selfish dictator that could be a reason why communism seems to not work. Besides that they both seem about the same to me.\r\n\r\nP.S. Stop calling us Socialist-Nazis! The Nazis weren\'t socialist they were fascist, they were even against all things socialist, communist, and Jewish. The Nazi party just put socialist in their name because the government helped the &quot;master race&quot; and i think to manipulate the people into joining them since socialism was growing at this time period. They\'re Fascist-Nazis.\r\nP.P.S. Yes, I am a Communist and I would like to be dictator of America without the public noticing. I also think Palin is the Anti-Chris \n     173.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.182 on 2011-03-24 05:46:12 \n         \n     In theory there may be some differences in the way the sentences are structured.\r\n\r\nIn practice socialism and communism are the same. They are identical. \n     71.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.233 on 2011-02-21 03:31:38 \n         \n     Rampant capitalism is bad for everyone. Capitalism with some regulation makes sense, this way we do not have to use tax payers money to bail out crooks that manipulate the markets, banks, and trade agreements. So capitalism as it is practiced in a democratic society like the USA, undermines democracy, it favors those in power and keeps the underclass sinking to the bottom. Socialism and Communism could work in theory if humans were more evolved and cared about the things that work for the common good. To get there we need several million years of evolution and a bigger brain to get all members of the society to agree what is good for the common good and decide to practice it with reverence and diligence.\r\nI say good luck! perhaps if aliens showed up and threatened our planet, then we would all have to work for the common good. \n     174.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.247 on 2011-02-13 20:48:57 \n         \n     Socialism is a transition period from capitalism to communism. So it is a low stage of communism.\r\nThat I learned in Russia and I am Russian born \n     170.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.49 on 2010-10-08 01:00:06 \n         \n     No political system works the way it should because in every system there are always going to be those who have the power and change the system to make themselves more powerful. That is the way of Humanity. Politics is a twin to religion in that no person agrees with every tenet of their party/group/sect and has their own views as to how things should be, or what is the truth. People thrive on conflict/competition and because of that there is no &quot;system&quot; that will work for everyone, or in every situation, because we all seem to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; about almost all issues. Everyone wants more...most cannot be content just being content and need to feel &quot;better&quot; than someone to feel good about their own situation. Political leaders are usually in it for the power that comes with the office, not to really make a change for the good of the many. NO decision is for the good of everyone, except possibly the &quot;keep the stupid from breeding&quot; thing, but, good luck with that! \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.193 on 2010-09-05 17:47:09 \n         \n     ts people.

Anyone not belonging to one can thank the principles of socialism for instilling the fear of unionization into the hearts and minds of management.

But what was it that ultimately prevented the creation of a viable economy? Why was production always of such poor quality, and goods interminably scarce? The USSR certainly had natural resources and an educated workforce. The answer lies in the deincentivization of productivity. When you take away from the productive to give to the unproductive, you punish initiative and reward idleness. The economy stagnates, and a corrupt kleptocracy develops. This is a cautionary tale for the socialists/progressives/liberals of our day. The road to economic hell is paved with the good intentions of those that equate &quot;social justice&quot; with the distribution of private capital (or perhaps even its abolition) rather than its creation.

More on topic, I believe socialism relies on human good will, but our history has shown that greed, selfishness, and self gain serve as greater sources of motivation. Workers rallying and union protests for better wages and equal pay are themselves against socialist ideal because most of them want greater or distributed pay to increase their own benefit or atleast not to see others benefit more than them. Everyone wants something, capitalism works to exploit it for progress. Capitalistic monopolies however can impied on that desire so I agree with regulation to that extent and lack of a heavy &quot;anti-fire&quot; market means we do infact need fire departments. However these public services purchasing from a capital markets is what allows a better fire engine, or a powerful water pump, or lightwieght ladders. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.146 on 2010-04-05 18:30:14 \n         \n     &quot;These ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.&quot;...and Nixon, and Reagan, and Bushes, and Greenspan, and Gingrich, and Limbaugh, Beck, Leiberman, Palin, McCain... \n     72.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.130 on 2010-03-30 12:58:15 \n         \n     24.21.84.143 stated the following on 2009-10-12 23:05:18 &quot;I wish Americans would become more educated and less slaves to the false idea that everyone can be rich.

Communism uses force and socialism uses deception because no population will voluntarily accept systems that are designed to enslave everyone with no individual freedoms. They are both a modern fuedal system that allows the &quot;ruling class&quot; to make all decisions and dispose of those they feel are not productive for the whole.\r\nThese ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.

How does that help you gain &quot;the power?&quot; Which system do you think offers you a better chance? One where an all-powerful government tells you what to do and when and for how long, or you being able to chose your own path through a free-market system. \r\n\r\nYou think that the rich screw the poor in your version of Capitalism, but you fail to realize that the poorest individual in the US is better off than any proletariat(look it up) from any Socialist/communist country you can name. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.147 on 2009-11-18 07:23:18 \n         \n     capitalism is worse than both, the rich have all the power, despite what you might think, the poor are fucked over by the rich people, the rich people in power give the other rich people more power and money. in socialism the poor and rich would be equal, the harder working poorer people would have a larger share, the people who in capitalism enherit their wealth would become poor because of their lack of skill and motivation. communism is unfair to all parties. i think i prefer socialism. \n     206.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.253 on 2009-11-11 15:34:34 \n         \n     two things: One, all those &quot;this is bullsh*t&quot; and &quot;this is dumb&quot; people should be taken out and shot, or at least prevented from reproducing.

My elementary school teacher described socialism as everyone putting all of their wages in one basket and distributing it equally among everyone despite their contribution. Why would anyone become a doctor, engineer, or a steeple painter if they will receive the same as those that do little or nothing.

This is not achievable due simply in part to human nature. It is our nature to strive and succeed for a better life regardless what realm you are looking at. But there will always be those who take advantage and reap the benefits of anothers hard work. While it sounds really great in theory to give everybody this and that, not all are going to contribute and not all are going to agree. This is a fact, not a theory.If it were really possible to create a perfect society, whether it be communist, socialist or any other, why have a currency system at all? Afterall, we all agree to help each other. It cannot be done. Utopia would never last just as communism and socialism will never last without genocide to keep from having a revolution. We naturally want what we feel we deserve for the work done and to not have it given away.

They like to lump things together and confuse definitions so that one can just easily accept their view. Not to go on about capitalist rhetoric and more to the point, from what I understand Socialism is characterized by &quot;each according to their ability&quot;, while Communism is characterized by &quot;each according to their need&quot;. Both economic systems, as Socialism and Communism are only economic systems, are theorized to be most effective under two governmental systems: Pure Democracy and Anarchy.

The reason we should care about this is that (and this is in really basic terms) there are some really lazy people out there. If working no longer benefits the individual, and the general population knows that they will be provided for regardless, where is the incentive to strive? If no one ever advances, why do well in your work? Communism frightens me because of potential lack of a central agency to enforce, and thereby protect. Socialism scares me because I think we can all count on one hand the politicians that actually have our best interests at heart. If they controlled everything, who is to say they would do right by the people? Everything sounds good during a campaign, but when the power is transferred, what happens? \n     70.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.185 on 2009-05-20 01:12:48 \n         \n     Can someone explain it in English?

Yes the taxes are high but the costs are low. In Denmark - it is in Europe, we have socialism and we have free schools, the government actually encourage people to get an education by offering free tutoring, and we have free health care. Just because socialism helps people with less money it does not pull others down from succeeding in the global world. United States - who always has favored capitalism, had a debt on $13,050,826,460,886.97 in 2010. When a country keeps lowering taxes to keep the people happy it will increase the debt since spendings keeps going up.

Augusto Pinochet, is reaching out to the now-legal Communist Party and other left-leaning groups in her bid to return to the nation\'s top post. \n \nIt\'s a politically pragmatic move in a country plagued by mounting social demands and frequent protests. \n \nBut it\'s also part of Bachelet\'s goal, assuming she regains the presidency, to oversee an overhaul of the education and tax systems, which would be the country\'s most wide-ranging reform in four decades. \n \nChile, the world\'s top producer of copper, is respected for its fast-growing economy, strong institutions and low unemployment. But it also has the worst inequality rate among the 34 countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. \n \nAs a presidential candidate, Bachelet needs the backing of the Communists and liberal social groups in the face of mounting demands and protests clamoring for a wider distribution of Chile\'s copper wealth, the preservation of the environment and free education. \n \nChile currently has two major electoral blocs, the center-left Concertacion coalition Bachelet leads and a center-right grouping that has said it will not back her proposals. Belonging to the country\'s Socialist Party, Bachelet says a change in the constitution is needed to break with the two-coalition system in place since the military dictatorship and allow one side or another to collect enough votes for significant change. \n \nEnormously popular in the last year of her 2006-2010 presidency, Bachelet is now the front-runner in the Nov. 17 vote. A survey by the pollster Centro de Estudios Publicos found that 54 percent of respondents who had made up their minds on a candidate said they would vote for Bachelet, far ahead of any other name. If that number holds, it would help her avoid a runoff election mandated if no candidate wins a majority of votes. \n \nThe CEP poll, conducted between November and December of last year, interviewed 1,484 people and had a margin of error of three percentage points. \n \nBachelet recently announced her plans to run for president after spending 2 1/2 years in New York as the first executive director of UN Women, the United Nations\' new agency for women and gender issues. \n \n"Given the characteristics of Michelle Bachelet, the question is not whether she\'ll win in the first or second round but whether she\'ll win the whole thing, and the answer is yes," said Bernardo Navarrete, a University of Santiago political scientist. \n \nBachelet hasn\'t directly mentioned courting the Communist Party but has echoed their demands for education and constitutional reform. \n \n"Chile needs a founding document born in democracy, a constitution aligned with the present conditions of Chile, that guarantees the economic and social rights to all Chileans," Bachelet said while announcing her pre-candidacy last month. \n \nThe other leading political group in Chile is the center-right Coalition for Change, which has been unable to capitalize on the country\'s economic success under the bloc\'s standard-bearer President Sebastian Pinera. Pinera enjoyed only a 31 percent approval rating in the late-2012 poll, and 29 percent approval for his handling of the economy. \n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 1 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 2 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Next Page \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t \n  \n  \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n\n\t\t \n \n   \n   \n   \n    \t\t\n\t \n\n\t\t\r\n\n\n\t\t \n   Follow @abc \n  \n   on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook \n    \n  \n\t\n\t\t\n\t  \n     \n     \n      \n      \n \n\t\n\t\n\t \n\t\n\n\t \n\t\n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Comment &amp; Contribute \n\t\t\t\t Do you have more information about this topic?

S'Lenin and the First Communist Revolutions, VII \n\n\n \n\n Lenin and the First Communist Revolutions, VII \n\n\n \n \n "War Communism", the Red Terror, and Lenin\'s Famine \n \nAlmost immediately after they seized power, Lenin\'s Bolsheviks inaugurated\nan endless stream of economic decrees and policies. These proved to be\ndisastrous, resulting in a horrific famine, depopulation of the cities,\nand an enormous decline in living standards. So unpopular were these\npolicies that after they were finally altered in mid 1921, Lenin tried to\nre-write their history. It was at this point that the Bolsheviks economic\npolicies from 1918-1921 were dubbed "War Communism," and declared to have\nbeen a temporary expedient forced upon Lenin\'s government by wartime\nconditions. In fact, so-called "War Communism" began before serious\nfighting erupted, and continued after the Whites had been decisively \ndefeated. It was not a wartime expedient; it was the policy that Lenin\nwanted to pursue in war or peace. As Pipes explains, "War Communism as a\nwhole was not a \'temporary measure\' but an ambitious and as it turned out\npremature attempt to introduce full-blown communism." ( The Russian\nRevolution ) As noted earlier, Lenin\'s ideas on desirable economic\npolicy were vague at best. So upon taking power, he looked around the\nworld for inspiration; what caught his eye was the "War Socialism" of the\nGerman Kaiser. As Paul Johnson notes:\n \nSo one might say that the man who really inspired Soviet economic planning\nwas Ludendorff. His "war socialism" certainly did not shrink from \nbarbarism. It employed slave-labourers. In January 1918 Ludendorff broke\na strike of 400,000 Berlin workers by drafting tens of thousands of them\nto the front in "labor battalions." Many of his methods were later to be\nrevived and intensified by the Nazis. It would be difficult to think of\na more evil model for a workers\' state. Yet these were precisely the \nfeatures of German "war socialism" Lenin most valued. ( Modern Times )\n \nThe primary features of War Communism were:\n \n \n Uncontrolled inflationary printing press finance, ultimately \nleading to hyperinflation and nationwide reversion to barter\n Near universal nationalization of manufacturing; widespread\nnationalization of retailing\n Stringent price controls upon and forced requisitioning of \nagricultural products; state monopoly on grain purchases\n Forced labor for civilians as well as the military\n \n \nThe package fit together quite logically. The tax system had broken down,\nso the Bolsheviks just turned on the Czar\'s printing pressing to fund their\nactivities. At the same time, the prices of most goods were fixed, so as\nthe money supply increased without limit, the legal prices became less\nand less realistic. Rationing cards replaced rubles as the means of\nacquiring goods. But if money no longer bought goods, then what was the\npoint of working? Hence, the imposition of compulsory labor.\n \nThe Bolsheviks\' forced labor policies gave new life to the concept of irony.\nThe men who had proclaimed themselves liberators of the workers and\ndenounced the exploitation of labor suddenly discovered the joys of serfdom.\nTrotsky stood at the theoretical vanguard of the literal proponents of\nslavery: "It is said that compulsory labor is unproductive. This means that\nthe whole socialist economy is doomed to be scrapped, because there is no\nother way of attaining socialism except through the command allocation of\nthe entire labor force by the economic center, the allocation of that force\nin accord with the needs of a nationwide economic plan." Initially the\nforced labor laws were applied to the (ex-)middle classes, but their\napplication rapidly broadened to include not only workers and peasants but\neven minors. As Pipes explains:\n \n \nBy late 1918, it became common practice for the Bolshevik authorities to\ncall up workers and specialists for state service exactly as they drafted\nrecruits into the Red Army. The practice was for the government to \nannounce that workers and technical specialists in a specified branch of\nthe economy were "mobilized for military service" and subject to court-\nmartial: those leaving jobs to which they had been assigned were treated\nas deserters... Efforts to organize industrial labor on the military model\ncould not have worked well in view of the plethora of decrees on this\nsubject, setting up ever new punishments for "labor deserters," ranging\nfrom publication of their names to confinement in concentration camps.\n( The Russian Revolution )\n \nOne would expect that the mere suggestion of compulsory labor, let alone its\nactual imposition, would have branded Lenin and Trotsky as demonic traitors\nto anyone who purported to care about the plight of workers. Ominously,\nit did not; Party intellectuals proclaimed the wonders of the new system.\n"Compulsory labour under capitalism, wrote Bukharin, was quite the reverse\nof compulsory labour under the dictatorship of the proletariat: the first\nwas \'the enslavement of the working class,\' the second the \'self-\norganization of the working class\'." (Paul Johnson, Modern Times )\nAt this point, the reluctance of Communists from Marx to Lenin to precisely\nexplain their proposed policies takes on a new meaning. As the Russian\nemigre Ayn Rand put it: " Intellectuals? You might have to worry about \nany other breed of men, but not about the modern intellectuals: they\'ll \nswallow anything. " ( Atlas Shrugged )\n \nAs the economy deteriorated, the Cheka waxed ever fatter. After an \nJuly 1918 revolt by SRs, the Cheka turned its guns on fellow \nsocialists, executing 350 captured SR rebels. One month later, the SR \nFanya Kaplan nearly succeeded in assassinating Lenin.\n \nHer noble effort unfortunately gave the Cheka the excuse to initiate the\nRed Terror, i.e., mass executions of people based not upon their actions\nbut their class origins and beliefs. As Landauer explains, "The first\nconspicuous act of government-ordered reprisals on a large scale without\nregard for individual guilt came after the assassination of Michael Uritzky\nand the attempt on Lenin\'s life on August 30. These events were not in\nthemselves apt to justify measures against the bourgeoisie, for the two\nassassins, Kenigiesser and Fania Kaplan, were both members of the Social\nRevolutionary party and therefore not "bourgeois." But the minds of the\nSoviet leaders were dominated by the theory that Social Revolutionaries and\nMensheviks were tools of the "class enemy," and it appeared logical to the\nBolsheviks to strike at the group which allegedly had inspired the\nassassination. \n \nFive hundred hostages were shot in reprisal in Petrograd\nalone by order of Zinoviev, the head of the local soviet. On September 5,\nthe people\'s commissars officially legalized the red terror..."\n( European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements )\n \nFrom then on the Cheka\'s executions never ceased. The exact number\nmurdered is usually estimated at between 100,000 and 500,000, but the\nchaotic wartime conditions make the accounting especially difficult.\nBut execution was not \nthe Cheka\'s only tool; it also pioneered the development of the modern \nslave labor (or "concentration") camp. Inmates were generally frankly \ntreated as government-owned slaves, and used for the most demanding sorts\nof work - such as digging arctic canals - while receiving pitifully small\nrations. As Pipes explains, "Soviet concentration camps, as instituted in\n1919, were meant to be a place of confinement for all kinds of undesirables,\nwhether sentenced by courts or by administrative organs. Liable to\nconfinement in them were not only individuals but also \'categories of\nindividuals\' - that is, entire classes: Dzerzhinskii at one point proposed\nthat special concentration camps be erected for the \'bourgeoisie.\' Living\nin forced isolation, the inmates formed a pool of slave labor on which \nSoviet administrative and economic institutions could draw at no cost."\n( The Russian Revolution ) The number of people in these camps \naccording to Pipes was about 50,000 prisoners in 1920 and 70,000 in 1923;\nmany of these did not survive the inhuman conditions.\n \nThe mildest manifestation of the Red Terror was the official policy \nexcluding "class enemies" entirely from the wartime rationing system; i.e.,\nlegally, it was often impossible for disfavored groups to even purchase\nfood. As Landauer simply puts it: "As a consequence, the average \n"bourgeois" had only the choice between death and illegal activities."\n( European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements )\nBourgeoisie with valued technical training could usually get around these \nrules, but otherwise their plight - and the plight of their families - was\nbleak indeed, though naturally far better than the inmates of the slave\nlabor camps.\n \n \n It is now and only now, when in the regions afflicted by the famine\nthere is cannibalism and the roads are littered with hundreds if not\nthousands of corpses, that we can (and therefore must) pursue the \nacquisition of [church] valuables with the most ferocious and merciless\nenergy, stopping at nothing in suppressing all resistance.\n \nV.I. Lenin\n \nBut the greatest crime committed by Lenin\'s regime was the civil war the\nSoviet government waged against the peasantry, and the famine this war\nprecipitated. The alliance of "the workers and peasants" was an ingenious\nslogan given the fact that almost everyone in Russia was a peasant. But\nit was a slogan that Lenin and his followers never had the slightest \nintention of following. They despised the peasants as ignorant "petty\nbourgeoisie" who stood in the way of collectivized agriculture. With one\nhand Lenin\'s regime legally recognized the peasants\' land seizures, but\nwith the other hand it demanded food at ever more unreasonable terms\n(in the end, unrestrained printing press finance plus price controls \neffectively required peasants to give their food away for free).\n"The law provided that all the grain that the producer had left over after\nsatisfying his personal needs and providing for seed belonged to the state\nand had to be sold to its agencies at fixed prices." (Richard Pipes,\n The Russian Revolution ) The consequences were a perfect illustration\nof the principles of "bourgeois" economics: with ever stricter price \ncontrols, peasants opted not to sell their grain to the cities. This made\nlife ever harder for urban workers, who fled back to the country in huge\nnumbers - often city populations declined by over 50%. Rather than repeal\nits price controls, the Bolshevik regime scapegoated black marketeers and\nspeculators, unleashing the Cheka upon them with orders to administer\nsummary executions. This merely drove up black market prices.\n \nSo Lenin\'s government advanced to the next stage: sending the Cheka and the\nRed Army to seize grain directly from the peasant. This was ideologically\njustified by dubbing peasants who resisted grain as wealthy "kulaks," though\nrich and poor alike found themselves staring down the muzzles of the \nCheka\'s guns. Once again, the resort to ever greater brutality did not\nbring the desired results. Minimal food was collected, and the peasants\nwent into open revolt. Lenin, who in every other matter seemed to be the\nmaster of the temporary compromise, could not control his hatred of the\nresisting peasants. He ordered kulaks to be deprived of not only surplus\ngrain, but even seed grain, while in his speeches he exhorted: \n \n"Merciless\nwar against the kulaks! Death to them." Even as the Red Army battled\nKolchak and Denikin, they waged a less visible civil war with the peasants.\nBy most estimates\nseveral hundred thousand peasants were killed as a result of this so-called\n"Bread War" - as usual, the Red Army and the Cheka executed not only\ncaptured rebels, but often families, friends, or entire villages associated,\nhowever vaguely, with counter-revolution.\n \nThe peasants had numbers on their side, and many soldiers were reluctant\nto fight them, but the government\'s superior organization ultimately gave\nthem victory over the peasants. \n \nBut the victory was hollow, for after\nthe fruit of their labor had been seized, farmers generally decided there\nwas no point in growing a surplus. Moreover, since seed grain was often\ntaken, many peasants were unable to grow surplus crops even if they wished.\nWhen the perverse incentives of price controls and expropriation were\nmixed with a drought, the result was one of the great disasters of the\ncentury: the Russian famine of 1921. \n\nOfficial Soviet reports admitted that\nfully 30 million Soviet citizens were in danger of death by \nstarvation. The White forces shared little of the blame: as Pipes notes,\nthe Civil War was essentially over by the beginning of 1920, but Lenin\ncontinued his harsh exploitation of the peasantry for yet another year.\n \nMoreover, the areas under White control had actually built up a food\n surplus . The horrific famine of 1921 was thus much less severe in\n1920, because after the reconquest of the Ukraine and other White\nterritories, the Reds shipped the Whites\' grain captured grain north to \nPetrograd, Moscow, and other cities with less hunger but more political \nclout. Low estimates on the deaths from this famine are about\n3 million; high estimates go up to 10 million - which would probably have\nbeen much higher if not for foreign relief efforts which Lenin had the\ngood sense to permit. For perspective, the last severe famine in Russia\nhit in 1891-92, and cost about 400,000 lives.\n \nNeedless to say, Lenin had no plans to respect the freedom of religion.\nBut until the famine, most of the persecution of religion appears to have\nbeen taken on local initiative. \n \nMost religious property was ordered\nexpropriated, although in fact clergymen usually continued to occupy and\nuse their church buildings. Parents lost the right to give their children\nreligious education - although again, during the Civil War years, this does\nnot seem to have been enforced. (Interestingly, while the state subsidies\nto the church greatly declined, the Orthodox Church under Lenin essentially\nremained a bureau of the state). Serious government persecution of the\nOrthodox Church began with the famine, which gave Lenin the\nchance to bring the Orthodox Church into line. \nHe demanded that the Church hand over\nvaluable relics to help famine victims (or so he said). The Church \nresisted, resulting in around 8000 executions of persons resisting the\nconfiscation of relics. Similar but milder persecution began against\nJews, Catholics, and to a lesser extent, Muslims. (These religions, however,\nhad less to lose than the Orthodox Church, because they had no subsidies\nfor the Bolsheviks to cut off).\n \nCan Lenin and his associates be held morally culpable for the deaths of\nthese millions of famine victims? If the famine were a natural catastrophe,\nthis would be unreasonable. But the famine was largely man-made, the \nresult of draconian price controls and requisitioning. Most of the \nevidence is that Lenin and his associates knew the probable results of\ntheir agricultural policies, but were willing to take the risk: according\nto Pipes, Lenin repeatedly said that he would sooner the whole nation\ndie of hunger than allow free trade in grain. In short, Lenin and his\ncomrades knew with substantial certainty that their policies would \n cause widespread death from starvation. Under any sensible \ndefinition of murder, this makes Lenin the murderer of millions.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n The Russian Civil War and the Russo-Polish War \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Worldwide Communist Revolutions: Hungary, Germany, Mongolia...'

A more comprehensive or ignominious collapse\xe2\x80\x94moral, material and intellectual\xe2\x80\x94would be difficult to imagine. Communism had tyrannised and impoverished its subjects, and slaughtered them in the tens of millions. For decades past, in the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, any allusion to the avowed aims of communist doctrine\xe2\x80\x94equality, freedom from exploitation, true justice\xe2\x80\x94had provoked only bitter laughter. Finally, when the monuments were torn down, statues of Karl Marx were defaced as contemptuously as those of Lenin and Stalin. Communism was repudiated as theory and as practice; its champions were cast aside, intellectual founders and sociopathic rulers alike. \n People in the West, their judgment not impaired by having lived in the system Marx inspired, mostly came to a more dispassionate view. Marx had been misunderstood, they tended to feel. The communism of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was a perversion of his thought. What happened in those benighted lands would have appalled Marx as much as it appals us. It has no bearing on the validity of his ideas. \n Indeed, it is suggested, Marx was right about a good many things\xe2\x80\x94about a lot of what is wrong with capitalism, for instance, about globalisation and international markets, about the business cycle, about the way economics shapes ideas. Marx was prescient; that word keeps coming up. By all means discard communism as practised in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (and China, North Korea, Cuba and in fact wherever it has been practised). But please don't discard Marx. \n  \n  In this section Marx after communism \n Life in plastic \n The future is Texas \n The fight for God \n Infallible \n The road to hell is unpaved \n That's what they want you to believe \n Who killed JFK? \n Eating out in Vietnam \n The - best place - last \n It's a dog's life \n A tale of two legacies \n Uncorking success \n Sent abroad to lie \n Help!

In 1999 the BBC conducted a series of polls, asking people to name the greatest men and women of the millennium. In October of that year, within a few weeks of the tenth anniversary of the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, the BBC declared the people's choice for \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest thinker\xe2\x80\x9d. It was Karl Marx. Einstein was runner-up, Newton and Darwin third and fourth, respectively. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough dictatorships throughout the 20th century have distorted [Marx's] original ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d the state-financed broadcaster noted, \xe2\x80\x9chis work as a philosopher, social scientist, historian and a revolutionary is respected by academics today.\xe2\x80\x9d Concerning the second point, at least, the BBC was correct: Marx is still accorded respect. \n As a field of scholarship in its own right, admittedly, Marxist political and economic theory is past its peak. By now, presumably, most of the things that Marx meant, or really meant, or probably meant, or might conceivably have meant, have been posited and adequately (though far from conclusively) debated. But a slackening of activity amid the staggeringly voluminous primary sources is not the best measure of Marx's enduring intellectual influence. \n Books on Marx aimed at undergraduates and non-specialists continue to sell steadily in Western Europe and the United States. And new ones keep coming. For instance, Verso has just published, to warm reviews, \xe2\x80\x9cMarx's Revenge\xe2\x80\x9d by Meghnad Desai, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics. Mr Desai argues that Marx was misunderstood and that the great man was right about far more than he is given credit for. In August, Oxford University Press published \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Read Marx Today?\xe2\x80\x9d by Jonathan Wolff. It too is an engaging read. The author, a professor at University College London, is a particularly skilful elucidator of political philosophy. In his book, he argues that Marx was misunderstood and that the great man was right about far more than he is given credit for. \n The newly released memoirs of Eric Hobsbawm, the celebrated historian, lifelong Marxist and unrepentant member of the Communist Party for as long as it survived, also deserve mention. The reviews were mixed, in fact, but rarely less than respectful, finding much to admire in the author's unwavering intellectual commitment. Mr Hobsbawm argues...well, he argues that Marx was misunderstood and that the great man was right about far more than he is given credit for. \n Adam Smith, one might say, stands in relation to liberal capitalism, a comparatively successful economic order, roughly where Marx stands in relation to socialism. Searches on Amazon.com and other booksellers indicate that titles in print about Marx outnumber books about Adam Smith by a factor of between five and ten. A hard day's browsing of undergraduate reading-lists suggests that, in economics faculties, Smith is way out in front\xe2\x80\x94interesting, given that Marx saw himself as an economist first and foremost. Elsewhere in the social sciences and humanities, the reverse is true. Smith is rarely seen, as you might expect, though in fact there is far more in Smith than just economics; whereas from Marx and his expositors and disciples it seems there is no escape. It is the breadth of Marx's continuing influence, especially as contrasted with his strange irrelevance to modern economics, that is so arresting. \n How is one to explain this? What, if anything, remains valuable in Marx's writings? This is not a straightforward question, given that he evidently had such difficulty making himself understood. \n \n Yes, Marx was a Marxist \n When he wanted to be, Marx was a compelling writer, punching out first-rate epigrams at a reckless pace. The closing sentences of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Communist Manifesto\xe2\x80\x9d (1848) are rightly celebrated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe workers have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to gain. Workers of the world, unite.\xe2\x80\x9d He also had an enviable flair for hysterical invective. At one point in \xe2\x80\x9cCapital\xe2\x80\x9d (1867-94), he famously defines the subject of his enquiry as \xe2\x80\x9cdead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks.\xe2\x80\x9d That is not only unforgettable but actually very apt, if you believe Marx's theory of value. He could express himself brilliantly when he chose to. \n In his \xe2\x80\x9cscientific\xe2\x80\x9d work, he minted jargon at a befuddling rate \n Yet he was also capable of stupefying dullness and impenetrable complexity. Try the opening pages of \xe2\x80\x9cCapital\xe2\x80\x9d (it picks up later). In his scientific work, as he called it, he minted jargon at a befuddling rate, underlining terms to emphasise their opacity, then changing their meaning at will. Adding to the fog, what Marx believed in 1844 was probably not what he believed in 1874: the only constant was his conviction that what he said at any time was both the absolute truth and fully consistent with what he had said before. And most of the published Marx, including the \xe2\x80\x9cManifesto\xe2\x80\x9d and volumes two and three of \xe2\x80\x9cCapital\xe2\x80\x9d, was edited, co-written or ghost written by Friedrich Engels. For many years, therefore, separating Marx from Engels in what the world understands as \xe2\x80\x9cMarx\xe2\x80\x9d was an academic industry in itself. \n Still, four things seem crucial, and most of the rest follows from these. First, Marx believed that societies follow laws of motion simple and all-encompassing enough to make long-range prediction fruitful. Second, he believed that these laws are exclusively economic in character: what shapes society, the only thing that shapes society, is the \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial forces of production\xe2\x80\x9d. Third, he believed that these laws must invariably express themselves, until the end of history, as a bitter struggle of class against class. Fourth, he believed that at the end of history, classes and the state (whose sole purpose is to represent the interests of the ruling class) must dissolve to yield a heaven on earth. \n Titles in print about Marx outnumber books about Adam Smith by a factor of between five and ten. From Marx and his expositors, there is no escape \n In what ways, then, was Soviet-style communism a deviation from these beliefs, as modern western commentators like to argue? Chiefly, it is said that Russia jumped the gun (forgive the expression). According to Marx's laws of motion, society is supposed to progress from feudalism to capitalism at just that point when feudalism fetters the forces of production, rather than serving them, as it has up to that moment. Later, capitalism gives way in turn to socialism, the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in much the same way\xe2\x80\x94once its productive potential has been fully achieved, so that henceforth its continued existence is an obstacle to material sufficiency rather than a means to it. But Russia went straight from feudalism to socialism. This was too quick. Marx could have told Lenin that it would never work. \n Is this really what he would have said? There is no doubt that Lenin saw himself as a true follower of Marx\xe2\x80\x94and he had every reason to. By the end of the 19th century, socialist thought was dividing. Marx's laws of motion were failing. Capitalism still flourished: no sign of the falling rate of profit that would signal its end. The working class was getting the vote. The welfare state was taking shape. Factory conditions were improving and wages were rising well above the floor of subsistence. All this was contrary to Marx's laws. \n In response, the left was splitting. On one side were reformers and social democrats who saw that capitalism could be given a human face. On the other were those who believed that Marx's system could be developed and restated, always true to its underlying logic\xe2\x80\x94and, crucially, with its revolutionary as opposed to evolutionary character brought to the fore. \n Marx's incapacity for compromise was pathological \n Whose side in this would Marx have been on? Revolution or reform? Would he have continued to insist that the vampire be destroyed? Or would he have turned reformer, asking it nicely to suck a bit less blood? The latter seems unlikely. Marx was a scholar, but he was also a fanatic and a revolutionary. His incapacity for compromise (with comrades, let alone opponents) was pathological. And in the preface to the 1882 Russian edition of the \xe2\x80\x9cManifesto\xe2\x80\x9d, his last published writing, Marx hoped that a revolution in Russia might become \xe2\x80\x9cthe signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both complement each other\xe2\x80\x9d; if so, Russia, despite its pre-capitalist characteristics, \xe2\x80\x9cmay serve as the starting-point for a communist development.\xe2\x80\x9d Lenin was surely right to believe that he, not those soft-headed bourgeois accommodationists, was true to the master's thought. \n \n Apart from the gulag \n Even if Soviet communism was true to Marx's ideas, or tried to be, that would not condemn all of Marx's thinking. He might still have been right about some things, possibly even the main things. \n Aspects of his thought do impress. However, his assorted sayings about the reach of the global market\xe2\x80\x94a favourite proof that \xe2\x80\x9cMarx was prescient\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not in fact the best examples. The 19th century was an era of globalisation, and Marx was only one of very many who noticed. The accelerating global integration of the past 30 years merely resumes a trend that was vigorously in place during Marx's lifetime, and which was subsequently interrupted in 1914. \n Marx was much more original in envisaging the awesome productive power of capitalism. He saw that capitalism would spur innovation to a hitherto-unimagined degree. He was right that giant corporations would come to dominate the world's industries (though not quite in the way he meant). He rightly underlined the importance of economic cycles (though his accounts of their causes and consequences were wrong). \n The central paradox that Marx emphasised\xe2\x80\x94namely, that its own colossal productivity would bring capitalism to its knees, by making socialism followed by communism both materially possible and logically necessary\xe2\x80\x94turned out to be false. Still, Marx could fairly lay claim to having sensed more clearly than others how far capitalism would change the material conditions of the world. And this in turn reflects something else that demands at least a grudging respect: the amazing reach and ambition of his thinking. \n On everything that mattered most to Marx himself, he was wrong \n But the fact remains that on everything that mattered most to Marx himself, he was wrong. The real power he claimed for his system was predictive, and his main predictions are hopeless failures. Concerning the outlook for capitalism, one can always argue that he was wrong only in his timing: in the end, when capitalism has run its course, he will be proved right. Put in such a form, this argument, like many other apologies for Marx, has the advantage of being impossible to falsify. But that does not make it plausible. The trouble is, it leaves out class. This is a wise omission, because class is an idea which has become blurred to the point of meaninglessness. Class antagonism, though, is indispensable to the Marxist world-view. Without it, even if capitalism succumbs to stagnation or decline, the mechanism for its overthrow is missing. \n Class war is the sine qua non of Marx. But the class war, if it ever existed, is over. In western democracies today, who chooses who rules, and for how long? Who tells governments how companies will be regulated? Who in the end owns the companies? Workers for hire\xe2\x80\x94the proletariat. And this is because of, not despite, the things Marx most deplored: private property, liberal political rights and the market. Where it mattered most, Marx could not have been more wrong. \n \n Right in principle \n Yet Marxist thinking retains great influence far beyond the dwindling number who proclaim themselves to be Marxists. The labour theory of value and the rest of Marx's economic apparatus may be so much intellectual scrap, but many of his assumptions, analytical traits and habits of thought are widespread in western academia and beyond. \n The core idea that economic structure determines everything has been especially pernicious. According to this view, the right to private property, for instance, exists only because it serves bourgeois relations of production. The same can be said for every other right or civil liberty one finds in society. The idea that such rights have a deeper moral underpinning is an illusion. Morality itself is an illusion, just another weapon of the ruling class. (As Gyorgy Lukacs put it, \xe2\x80\x9cCommunist ethics makes it the highest duty to act wickedly...This is the greatest sacrifice revolution asks from us.\xe2\x80\x9d) Human agency is null: we are mere dupes of \xe2\x80\x9cthe system\xe2\x80\x9d, until we repudiate it outright. \n What goes for ethics also goes for history, literature, the rest of the humanities and the social sciences. The \xe2\x80\x9clate Marxist\xe2\x80\x9d sees them all, as traditionally understood, not as subjects for disinterested intellectual inquiry but as forms of social control. Never ask what a painter, playwright, architect or philosopher thought he was doing. You know before you even glance at his work what he was really doing: shoring up the ruling class. This mindset has made deep inroads\xe2\x80\x94most notoriously in literary studies, but not just there\xe2\x80\x94in university departments and on campuses across Western Europe and especially in the United States. The result is a withering away not of the state but of opportunities for intelligent conversation and of confidence that young people might receive a decent liberal education. \n Marxist thinking is also deeply Utopian\xe2\x80\x94another influential trait. The \xe2\x80\x9cCommunist Manifesto\xe2\x80\x9d, despite the title, was not a programme for government: it was a programme for gaining power, or rather for watching knowledgeably as power fell into one's hands. That is, it was a commentary on the defects and dynamics of capitalism. Nowhere in the \xe2\x80\x9cManifesto\xe2\x80\x9d, or anywhere else in his writings, did Marx take the trouble to describe how the communism he predicted and advocated would actually work. \n \n Marx's theory of cattle \n He did once say this much: \xe2\x80\x9cIn communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity...society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have in mind, without ever becoming hunter, herdsman or critic.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether cattle would be content to be reared only in the evening, or just as people had in mind, is one of many questions one would wish to see treated at greater length. But this cartoon is almost all Marx ever said about communism in practice. The rest has to be deduced, as an absence of things he deplored about capitalism: inequality, exploitation, alienation, private property and so forth. \n  \n It is striking that today's militant critics of globalisation, whether declared Marxists or otherwise, proceed in much the same way. They present no worked-out alternative to the present economic order. Instead, they invoke a Utopia free of environmental stress, social injustice and branded sportswear, harking back to a pre-industrial golden age that did not actually exist. Never is this alternative future given clear shape or offered up for examination. \n Anti-globalists have inherited plenty from Marx \n And anti-globalists have inherited more from Marx besides this. Note the self-righteous anger, the violent rhetoric, the willing resort to actual violence (in response to the \xe2\x80\x9cviolence\xe2\x80\x9d of the other side), the demonisation of big business, the division of the world into exploiters and victims, the contempt for piecemeal reform, the zeal for activism, the impatience with democracy, the disdain for liberal \xe2\x80\x9crights\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfreedoms\xe2\x80\x9d, the suspicion of compromise, the presumption of hypocrisy (or childish naivety) in arguments that defend the market order. \n Anti-globalism has been aptly described as a secular religion. So is Marxism: a creed complete with prophet, sacred texts and the promise of a heaven shrouded in mystery. Marx was not a scientist, as he claimed. He founded a faith. The economic and political systems he inspired are dead or dying. But his religion is a broad church, and lives on. \n\n \n\n  \n  From the print edition: Christmas Specials  \n \n \n \n  \n  Recommend 25 \n \n Tweet \n Submit to reddit \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n  Related items  TOPIC: Communism &raquo; China&#039;s future: Xi Jinping and the Chinese dream \n Religious freedom in Russia: Spiritual insecurity \n Soviet history: Stalin and his cursed cause \n  TOPIC: Karl Marx &raquo; Gendered language: An ombudsman by any other name would still field complaints \n Letters: On immigration, Syria, textbooks, Ayn Rand, Spain, voting \n An A-Z of business quotations: Capitalism \n   TOPIC: Government and politics &raquo; Canada&#039;s new central-bank governor: Surprise appointment \n Britain\xe2\x80\x99s local elections: Send in the clowns! \n Focus: Italy \n  \n \n  \n  Want more?

Laws governing private action should be extremely minimal, etc. It&#039;s mostly likely invoked to produce an extreme contrast with socialism. It is possible that you might also be confusing libertarianism with liberalism, which classically means support for a relatively limited government and person freedom for the individual (current liberals and conservatives in the US will generally claim to be classical liberals.) \r\n \r\nOr in a nutshell: \r\n \r\nlibertarianism and communism are extreme forms of liberalism and socialism respectively. \r\n \r\nAlso people who call Obama a socialist are mostly wrong. People who call him a Marxist are crazy, and anyone who accuses him of being a libertarian is probably confused. \n\n    \n     4 years ago \n\n      \n        \n       Report Abuse \n       \n       \n\n   \n      \n   \n    \n        \n     14 people rated this as good \n           \n   \n     \n      \n   Asker's Rating: \n    \n      Asker's Comment: \n    Thank you!!!

It realates all actions to concrete material world that actions must be beneficial to gain for the people. In other words, the government must act for the sole benefit of the people. \r\nMarx once commented that &quot;how people think are how they live.&quot; he also believed that people entered into economic relationships that were independent of their will which caused reduction in their potential. \r\nhe believed that the government should manage the economy so that people who were best suited for particular jobs because of their desires and the skills should be placed in those positions, because it would bring the most benefit to society. example: if you love to cook and are good at it, the government should see to it that you are a cook. \r\nRemember though Marx&#039;s views weren&#039;t totally created by Marx alone. Matter of fact his views may just as well benefit a corporation if it wasn&#039;t for the infuence of Engles and its very critical nature of capitalism. \r\n \r\nGenerally in contrast communism is a decentralization of government power in an attempt to create a stateless classless society but there exists many philosophies of how this may be achieved, which most revolve around some sort of communitarian organization. \r\n \r\nSocialism is centralization of control over production and distribution of goods and services. The soul driving force instead of like in marxist ideals of placing people into society positions that they are suited for, the motivation would be police powers of the government. \r\nThe government dictates what is produced, what will be done with it, and how much will be charged. Even if you are allowed to own a business, if you don&#039;t follow the guidelines you&#039;ll end up getting your bsuiness siezed and thrown in jail. \r\nThink of it as how our government treats drugs. They allow certain types to be produced, and dictates how they will be distributed. They don&#039;t so much as control price other than busting black markets that sell for less or sel drugs that aren&#039;t approved to be produced and sold. \r\n \r\nLibertarianism seeks to decentralize government authority in all aspects of life. I can see where some people could somewhat compare it to the same goals in communism, but realistically they are focusing on two different objectives, since communism seems to retain strict social controls while libertarians are socially liberal. \n\n    \n     4 years ago \n\n      \n        \n       Report Abuse \n       \n       \n\n   \n      \n   \n    \n             1 person rated this as good \n           \n   \n     \n     \n \n    \n                   \n    \n          \n   \n\n \n \n  \n \n  by  Joe from WI \n \n \n \n  \n  Member since: \n   September 30, 2007 \n    Total points: \n  17,964 (Level 6) \n  \n \n  \n      \n   \n   Add Contact \n  Block \n \n      \n     Answer hidden due to its low rating\n    \n   \n    Wikipedia is where you should go.

[ 1 ]  [ 2 ] \n The term socialist economics may also be applied to analysis of former and existing economic systems that call themselves "socialist", such as the works of Hungarian economist J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai . [ 3 ] \n Socialist economics has been associated with different schools of economic thought, most notably Marxian economics , institutional economics , evolutionary economics and neoclassical economics . Early socialism, like Ricardian socialism , was based on classical economics . During the 20th century, proposals and models for planned economies and market socialism were based heavily on neoclassical economics or a synthesis of neoclassical economics with Marxian or institutional economics. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Description \n \n 1.1 Socialist economic planning \n 1.2 Normative aspects \n 1.3 Economic value in socialism \n 1.4 Socialist economies in theory \n \n \n 2 Socialist economies in practice \n \n 2.1 Centrally planned economies \n \n 2.1.1 Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n 2.1.2 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n 2.1.3 Post-Soviet reforms \n \n \n 2.2 People\'s Republic of China \n 2.3 Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n 2.4 State capitalism \n \n 2.4.1 Singapore \n 2.4.2 India \n \n \n 2.5 Paris Commune \n 2.6 Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n \n 2.6.1 Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n 2.6.2 Self-managed enterprises \n \n \n 2.7 Anarchist Spain \n \n \n 3 History of socialist economic thought \n \n 3.1 Utopian socialism \n 3.2 Socialism and classical political economy \n 3.3 Socialist political economy before Marx \n 3.4 Das Kapital \n 3.5 Anarchist economics \n 3.6 After Marx \n \n \n 4 Criticisms \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n 7 Further reading \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Description \n See also: Socialist mode of production \n \n "I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate (the) grave evils (of capitalism), namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society." \n \xe2\x80\x94 Albert Einstein , Why Socialism? , 1949 [ 4 ]  \n \n A socialist economy is a system of production where goods and services are produced directly for use , in contrast to a capitalist economic system, where goods and services are produced to generate profit (and therefore indirectly for use). [ 5 ] Goods and services would be produced for their usefulness, or for their use-value, eliminating the need for market-induced needs to ensure a sufficient amount of demand for products to be sold at a profit. Production in a socialist economy is therefore "planned" or "coordinated", and does not suffer from the business cycle inherent to capitalism. In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the factors of production and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market. Karl Marx stated that "lower-stage communism" would consist of compensation based on the amount of labor one contributes to the social product. [ 6 ] \n The ownership of the means of production varies in different socialist theories. It can either be based on public ownership by a state apparatus; direct ownership by the users of the productive property through worker cooperative ; or commonly owned by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production. \n Management and control over the activities of enterprises is based on self-management and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximize occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals. [ 7 ] \n However, the economies of the former Socialist states , excluding SFR Yugoslavia, were based on bureaucratic, top-down administration of economic directives and micromanagement of the worker in the workplace inspired by capitalist models of scientific management . As a result, socialists have argued that they were not socialist due to the lack of equal power-relations in the workplace, the presence of a new "elite", and because of the commodity production that took place in these economies. These economic and social systems have been classified as being either Bureaucratic collectivist , State capitalist or Deformed workers\' states , the exact nature of the USSR et al remains unresolved within the socialist movement [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economic planning \n Main article: Economic planning \n Economic planning is a mechanism for the allocation of economic inputs and decision-making based on direct allocation, in contrast to the market mechanism , which is based on indirect allocation. [ 9 ] An economy based on economic planning appropriates its resources as needed, so that allocation comes in the form of internal transfers rather than market transactions involving the purchasing of assets by one government agency or firm by another. Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level. \n Economic planning is not synonymous with the concept of a command economy , which existed in the Soviet Union , and was based on a highly bureaucratic administration of the entire economy in accordance to a comprehensive plan formulated by a central planning agency, which specified output requirements for productive units and tried to micromanage the decisions and policies of enterprises. The command economy is based on the organizational model of a capitalist firm, but applies it to the entire economy. [ 10 ] \n Various advocates of economic planning have been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, Leon Trotsky believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand the local conditions and rapid changes in the economy. Therefore, central planners would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity because they lacked this informal information. [ 11 ] \n Economic planning in socialism takes a different form than economic planning in capitalist mixed economies (such as Dirigisme , Central banking and Indicative planning ); in the former case planning refers to production of use-value directly (planning of production), while in the latter case planning refers to the planning of capital accumulation in order to stabilize or increase the efficiency of this process. \n [ edit ] Normative aspects \n See also: Socialist critique of capitalism \n The goal of socialist economics is to neutralize capital (or, in the case of market socialism , to subject investment and capital to social planning [ 12 ] ), to coordinate the production of goods and services to directly satisfy demand (as opposed to market-induced needs), and to eliminate the business cycle and crisis of overproduction that occur as a result of an economy based on capital accumulation and private property in the means of production. \n Socialists generally aim to achieve greater equality in decision-making and economic affairs, grant workers greater control of the means of production and their workplace, and to eliminate exploitation by directing the surplus value to employees. Free access to the means of subsistence is a requisite for liberty, because it ensures that all work is voluntary and no class or individual has the power to coerce others into performing alienating work. \n The ultimate goal for Marxist socialists is the emancipation of labor from alienating work, and therefore freedom from having to perform such labor to receive access to the material necessities for life. It is argued that freedom from necessity would maximize individual liberty, as individuals would be able to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labor for others (the power-elite or ruling class in this case) via mechanisms of social control, such as the labor market and the state. The stage of economic development in which this is possible is contingent upon advances in the productive capabilities of society. This advanced stage of social relations and economic organization is called pure communism . \n [ edit ] Economic value in socialism \n Socialist economic theories base the value of a good or service on its use value , rather than its cost of production ( labor theory of value ) or its exchange value ( Marginal Utility ). [ 13 ] \n Other socialist theories, such as mutualism and market socialism , attempt to apply the labor theory of value to socialism, so that the price of a good or service is adjusted to equal the amount of labor time expended in its production. The labor-time expended by each worker would correspond to labor credits, which would be used as a currency to acquire goods and services. \n Market socialists that base their models on neoclassical economics , and thus marginal utility , such as Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner , have proposed that publicly owned enterprises set their price to equal marginal cost, thereby achieving pareto efficiency . \n Anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value and exchange value itself, advocated a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in theory \n Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert identify five economic models within the rubric of socialist economics: [ 15 ] \n \n Public Enterprise Centrally Planned Economy in which all property is owned by the State and all key economic decisions are made centrally by the State, e.g. the former Soviet Union. \n Public Enterprise State-Managed Market Economy , one form of market socialism which attempts to use the price mechanism to increase economic efficiency , while all decisive productive assets remain in the ownership of the state, e.g. socialist market economy in China after reform. \n A mixed economy , where public and private ownership are mixed, and where industrial planning is ultimately subordinate to market allocation, the model generally adopted by social democrats e.g. in twentieth century Sweden. \n Public Enterprise Employee Managed Market Economies , another form of market socialism in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free market exchange of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid twentieth century Yugoslavia, Two more theoretical models are Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar \'s Progressive Utilization Theory and Economic democracy . \n Public Enterprise Participatory Planning , an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. stateless communism , libertarian socialism . An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the Spanish revolution . More developed theoretical models include those of Karl Polanyi , Participatory Economics and the negotiated coordination model of Pat Devine , as well as in Cornelius Castoriadis \'s pamphlet "Workers\' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society". [ 16 ] \n \n Additionally, J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai identifies five distinct classifications for socialism: \n \n Classical / Marxist conception, where socialism is a stage of economic development in which wage labour, private property in the means of production and monetary relations have been made redundant through the development of the productive forces, so that capital accumulation has been superseded by economic planning . Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the "anarchy of production" of capitalism. \n Walrasian / Market Socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative-enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises. \n Leninist conception, which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class, and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning (a "command economy"). \n Social Democratic concept, based on the capitalist mode of production , which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism, and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property; instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state, which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise. \n East Asian model, or socialist market economy , based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J\xc3\xa1nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader. [ 17 ] \n \n [ edit ] Socialist economies in practice \n Although a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as wage labor , the accumulation of capital , and commodity production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history. \n Various forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 examples of this include cooperative enterprises in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free-software movement based on social peer-to-peer production . \n [ edit ] Centrally planned economies \n A centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with centralised state planning . This model is usually associated with the Soviet-style command economy . In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. The planning process was based around material balances &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the USSR and Eastern bloc economies, this economic model was also utilized by the People\'s Republic of China , Socialist Republic of Vietnam , Republic of Cuba and North Korea . \n [ edit ] Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism \n Various scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy, and specifically, the Soviet model of economic development, constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the accumulation of capital and the extraction of surplus value from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union (and other Soviet-style economies) were state capitalist economies. [ 18 ] More fundamentally, these economies are still structured around the dynamic of capitalism: the accumulation of capital and production for profit (as opposed to being based on production for use &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the defining criterion for socialism), and have not yet transcended the system of capitalism but are in fact a variation of capitalism based on a process of state-directed accumulation. [ 19 ] \n Other socialist critics point to the lack of socialist social relations in these economies&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 specifically the lack of self-management , a bureaucratic elite based on hierarchical and centralized powers of authority, and the lack of genuine worker control over the means of production&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 leading them to conclude that they were not socialist but either bureaucratic collectivism or state capitalism . [ 20 ]  Trotskyists argue they are neither socialist nor capitalist&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 but are deformed workers\' states . \n This analysis is consistent with Lenin\'s April Theses , which stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism, which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers\' Deputies. Furthermore, these "Communist states" often do not claim to have achieved socialism in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \'s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976, [ 21 ] and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism". [ 22 ] \n This view is challenged by Stalinists and their followers, who claim that socialism was established in the Soviet Union after Joseph Stalin came to power and instituted the system of five year plans. Joseph Stalin introduced the theory of Socialism in one country , which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. \n [ edit ] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n Main article: Economy of the Soviet Union \n See also: Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union) , Gosplan ,&#160;and Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union \n The Soviet Union and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally planned economy . They dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production. Workers were still, however, effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers\' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx\'s views of historical materialism , and his views of the process of socialization. \n The characteristics of this model of economy were: \n \n Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers. Critics [ who? ] of both left and right persuasions have argued that the economy was plagued by incentive-related problems; [ citation needed ] claiming, for instance, that the system incentivized enterprise managers to underreport their unit\'s productive capacities so that their quotas would be easier to achieve, especially since the manager\'s bonuses were linked to the fulfillment of quotas. \n \n \n Allocation through political control . In contrast with systems where prices determined allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so after the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place. \n Full employment . Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan. \n Clearing goods by planning : if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use. \n Five Year Plans for the long-term development of key industries. \n \n [ edit ] Post-Soviet reforms \n After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, many of the remaining socialist states presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. \n The Republic of Cuba , under the leadership of Raul Castro , has begun to encourage co-operatives and self-employment in a move to reduce the central role of state enterprise and state management over the economy, with the goal of building a co-operative form of socialism. [ 23 ] \n Vietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the socialist-oriented market economy . This economic system is a form of mixed-economy consisting of state, private, co-operative and individual enterprises coordinated by the market mechanism . This system is intended to be transitional stage in the development of socialism. \n [ edit ] People\'s Republic of China \n Main article: Economy of the People\'s Republic of China \n China embraced a socialist planned economy after the Communist victory in its Civil War. Private property and private ownership of capital were abolished, and various forms of wealth made subject to state control or to workers\' councils. \n The Chinese economy broadly adopted a similar system of production quotas and full employment by fiat to the Russian model. The Great Leap Forward saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture, and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected, (e.g., there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after three years. \n In recent decades China has opened its economy to foreign investment and to market-based trade, and has continued to experience strong economic growth. It has carefully managed the transition from a planned socialist economy to a market economy, officially referred to as the socialist commodity market economy , which has been likened to capitalism by some outside observers. [ 24 ] As a result, centralized economic planning has little relevance in China today. \n The current Chinese economic system is characterized by state ownership combined with a strong private sector that privately owned enterprises that generate about 33% [ 25 ] (People\'s Daily Online 2005) to over 50% of GDP in 2005, [ 26 ] with a BusinessWeek article estimating 70% [ 27 ] of GDP, a figure that might be even greater considering the Chengbao system . Some western observers note that the private sector is likely underestimated by state officials in calculation of GDP due to its propensity to ignore small private enterprises that are not registered. [ 28 ] Most of the state and private sectors of economy are governed by free market practices, including a stock exchange for trading equity. The free-market is the arbitrator for most economic activity, which is left to the management of both state and private firms. A significant amount of privately owned firms exist, especially in the consumer service sector. [ 29 ] \n The state sector is concentrated in the \'commanding heights\' of the economy with a growing private sector engaged primarily in commodity production and light industry. Centralized directive planning based on mandatory output requirements and production quotas has been superseded by the free-market mechanism for most of the economy and directive planning is utilized in some large state industries. [ 29 ] A major difference from the old planned economy is the privatization of state institutions. 150 state-owned enterprises remain and report directly to the central government, most having a number of subsidiaries. [ 30 ] By 2008, these state-owned corporations have became increasingly dynamic largely contributing to the increase in revenue for the state. [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] The state-sector led the economic recovery process and increased economic growth in 2009 after the financial crises. [ 33 ] \n This type of economic system is defended from a Marxist perspective which states that a socialist planned economy can only be possible after first establishing the necessary comprehensive commodity market economy, letting it fully develop until it exhausts its historical stage and gradually transforms itself into a planned economy. [ 34 ] Proponents of this model distinguish themselves from market socialists who believe that economic planning is unattainable, undesirable or ineffective at distributing goods, viewing the market as the solution rather than a temporary phase in development of a socialist planned economy. \n The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has pursued similar economic reforms, though less extensive, which have resulted in what is officially called a Socialist-oriented market economy , a mixed economy where the state plays a dominant role intended to be a transitional phase in establishment of a socialist economy. [ 35 ] \n [ edit ] Social Democratic Mixed Economies \n Main article: Social democracy \n Many of the industrialized, open countries of Western Europe experimented with one form of social democratic mixed economies or another during the 20th century. These include Britain (mixed economy and welfare state) from 1945 to 1979, France (state capitalism and indicative planning) from 1945 to 1982 under dirigisme, Sweden (social democratic welfare state) and Norway (state capitalist mixed economy) to the present. They can be regarded as social democratic experiments, because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production. \n Nevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a purely private capitalist model. Variations range from social democratic welfare states , such as in Sweden, to mixed economies where a major percentage of GDP comes from the state sector, such as in Norway, which ranks among the highest countries in quality of life and equality of opportunity for its citizens. [ 36 ] Elements of these efforts persist throughout Europe, even if they have repealed some aspects of public control and ownership. They are typically characterized by: \n \n Nationalization of key industries, such as mining, oil, steel, energy and transportation. A common model is for a sector to be taken over by the state and then one or more publicly owned corporations set up for its day-to-day running. Advantages of nationalization include: the ability of the state to direct investment in key industries, the distribution of state profits from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals, greater control of the industries by and for the workers, and the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace. \n Redistribution of wealth , through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of progressive taxation regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common. \n Social security schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and parental leave. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities. \n Minimum wages , employment protection and trade union recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce full employment . There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged strikes rather than negotiation. \n National planning for industrial development. \n Demand management in a Keynesian fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment. \n \n [ edit ] State capitalism \n Various state capitalist economies, which consist of large commercial state enterprises that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, have evolved in countries that have been influenced by various elected socialist political parties and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism, and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology. \n [ edit ] Singapore \n Main article: Economy of Singapore \n Singapore pursued a state-led model of economic development under the People\'s Action Party , which initially adopted a Leninist approach to politics and a broad socialist model of economic development. [ 37 ] The PAP was initially a member of the Socialist International . Singapore\'s economy is dominated by state-owned enterprises and government-linked companies through Temasek Holdings , which generate 60% of Singapore\'s GDP. [ 38 ] \n The state also provides substantial public housing, free education, health and recreational services, as well as comprehensive public transportation. [ 39 ] Today Singapore is often characterized as having a state capitalist economy that combines economic planning with the free-market. [ 40 ] While government-linked companies generate a majority of Singapore\'s GDP, moderate state planning in the economy has been reduced in recent decades. \n [ edit ] India \n Main article: Economy of India \n After gaining independence from Britain, India adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a mixed economy , it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the USSR or China. Today India is often characterized as having a free-market economy that combines economic planning with the free-market . It did however adopt a very firm focus on national planning with a series of broad Five-Year Plans . \n [ edit ] Paris Commune \n Main article: Paris Commune \n The Paris Commune was considered to be a prototype mode of economic and political organization for a future socialist society by Karl Marx. Private property in the means of production was abolished so that individuals and co-operative associations of producers owned productive property and introduced democratic measures where elected officials received no more in compensation than the average worker and could be recalled at any time. [ 41 ] \n [ edit ] Social ownership and peer-to-peer production \n Various forms of socialist organization based on co-operative decision making, workplace democracy and in some cases, production directly for use , have existed within the broader context of the capitalist mode of production since the Paris Commune. New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making. \n Michel Bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as an emergent alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital. [ 42 ] \n Commons-based peer production generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code. In both cases, production is carried out directly for use&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 software is produced solely for their use-value . \n Wikipedia , being based on collaboration and cooperation and a freely associated individuals , has been cited as a template for how socialism might operate. [ 43 ] This is a modern example of what the Paris Commune&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 a template for possible future organization&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 was to Marx in his time. \n [ edit ] Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n Main article: Economy of SFR Yugoslavia \n Yugoslavia pursued a socialist economy based on autogestion or worker-self management. Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were socially owned rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to Edvard Kardelj \'s theory of associated labor. \n [ edit ] Self-managed enterprises \n See also: Cooperative \n The Mondragon Corporation , a federation of cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management, which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures, have been adopted by various private corporations such as Cisco Systems , inc. [ 44 ] But unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership. More fundamentally, employee-owned, self-managed enterprises still operate within the broader context of capitalism and are subject to the accumulation of capital and profit-loss mechanism. \n [ edit ] Anarchist Spain \n Main article: Spanish revolution \n See also: Anarcho-syndicalism \n The Spanish Revolution was a workers\' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly socialist organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily Catalonia, Aragon, Andalusia, and parts of the Levante. Much of Spain\'s economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy Communist Party influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes. Even places like hotels, barber shops, and restaurants were collectivized and managed by their workers. Sam Dolgoff estimated that over 10 million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." \n [ edit ] History of socialist economic thought \n Main article: History of socialism \n Values of socialism have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations, and communal charity of Mediaeval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations. [ 45 ] As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in Enlightenment doctrine such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau \'s Discourse on Inequality , Wilhelm von Humboldt \'s Limits of State Action , or Immanuel Kant \'s insistent defense of the French Revolution . [ 46 ] \n Capitalism appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 land, elaborate machinery, and labour&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 and these imperatives led to the commodification of these elements. [ 47 ] \n According to influential socialist economic historian Karl Polanyi \'s classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre-existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of "primitive accumulation" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter-movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society. These counter-movements, that included, for example, the Luddite rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory. \n As Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market\'s worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively "exploitative", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity. \n Within this context socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s-1850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and Communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830\xe2\x80\x931916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the Soviet Union , and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916\xe2\x80\x931989); and the response of socialism in the neo-liberal era (1990- ). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics. \n [ edit ] Utopian socialism \n Main article: Utopian socialism \n The first theories which came to hold the term "socialism" began to be formulated in the late 18th century, and were termed "socialism" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters, or "capitalists" as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages. (See Iron law of wages ). \n Socialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the Shakers in America. \n Utopian socialism had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems. \n [ edit ] Socialism and classical political economy \n The first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in Adam Smith , Robert Malthus and David Ricardo . In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a class analysis , a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being unproductive . Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a " general glut ", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war. \n [ edit ] Socialist political economy before Marx \n \n \n \n  \n Charles Fourier , influential early French socialist thinker \n \n \n A key early socialist theorist of political economy was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . He was the most well-known of nineteenth century mutualist theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: Technocrats like Henri de Saint Simon, agrarian radicals like Thomas Spence , William Ogilvie and William Cobbett ; anti-capitalists like Thomas Hodgskin ; communitarian and utopian socialists like Robert Owen , William Thompson and Charles Fourier ; anti-market socialists like John Gray and John Francis Bray ; the Christian mutualist William Batchelder Greene ; as well as the theorists of the Chartist movement and early proponents of syndicalism . [ 48 ] \n The first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count Henri de Saint-Simon was the first individual to coin the term "socialism". [ 49 ] Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology, which led him to advocate a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and which would be based upon equal opportunities. [ 50 ] Simon advocated a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. [ 49 ] This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organized economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, which embodied a desire for a semi- planned economy . [ 49 ] \n Other early socialist thinkers were influenced by the classical economists. The Ricardian socialists , such as Thomas Hodgskin and Charles Hall, were based on the work of David Ricardo and reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value. [ 51 ] \n [ edit ] Das Kapital \n Main article: Das Kapital \n Karl Marx employed systematic analysis in an ambitious attempt to elucidate capitalism\'s contradictory laws of motion, as well as to expose the specific mechanisms by which it exploits and alienates. He radically modified classical political economic theories. Notably, the labor theory of value that had been worked upon by Adam Smith and David Ricardo , was transformed into his characteristic " law of value " and used for the purpose of revealing how commodity fetishism obscures the reality of capitalist society. \n His approach, which Engels would call " scientific socialism ", would stand as the branching point in economic theory: in one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.". [ 52 ] \n Das Kapital is one of the many famous incomplete works of economic theory: Marx had planned four volumes, completed two, and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways the work is modelled on Adam Smith\'s Wealth of Nations , seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption and finance in relation to morality and the state. \n It is a work of philosophy, anthropology and sociology as much as one of economics. However, it has several important statements: \n \n The Law of Value Capitalist production is the production of \xe2\x80\x9can immense multitude of commodities\xe2\x80\x9d or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference,\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \xe2\x80\x9cis independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 53 ] But rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker\'s wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments. \n \n \n Historical Property Relations Historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the means of production by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban proletariat based on the institution of wage-labour . Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the metabolic rift between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas. [ 54 ] \n Commodity Fetishism Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. "Commodity fetishism" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation. \n Economic Exploitation Workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the surplus value created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists. \n Accumulation Inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist\'s social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money--&gt;Commodity--&gt;Money\', where the capitalist receives an increment or "surplus value" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale. \n Crises Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism\'s inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few. \n Centralization The interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital. \n Material Development As a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the productivity of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure. \n Socialization, and the pre-conditions for Revolution By socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program. [ 55 ] \n \n [ edit ] Anarchist economics \n Main article: Anarchist economics \n Anarchist economics is the set of theories and practices of economics and economic activity within the political philosophy of anarchism . \n Pierre Joseph Proudhon was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe his own teachings . [ 56 ]  Mutualism is an anarchist school of thought that originates in the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon , who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production , either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market . [ 57 ] Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. [ 58 ] Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange, it ought to receive goods or services embodying "the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility". [ 59 ] Receiving anything less would be considered exploitation, theft of labor, or usury . \n \n \n \n  \n The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin , influential work which presents the economic vision of anarcho-communism \n \n \n Collectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary [ 60 ] doctrine that advocates the abolition of the state and private ownership of the means of production . Instead, it envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. Once collectivization takes place, workers \' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market. [ 61 ] Collectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin , the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International , and the early Spanish anarchist movement . \n Anarchist communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state , private property , and capitalism in favor of common ownership of the means of production , [ 62 ]  [ 63 ]  direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "from each according to ability, to each according to need". [ 64 ]  [ 65 ] Unlike mutualism, collectivist anarchism and marxism, anarcho-communism as defended by Peter Kropotkin and Errico Malatesta rejected the labor theory of value altogether, instead advocating a gift economy and to base distribution on need. [ 14 ] \n Anarchist communism as a coherent, modern economic-political philosophy was first formulated in the Italian section of the First International by Carlo Cafiero , Emilio Covelli , Errico Malatesta , Andrea Costa and other ex- Mazzinian Republicans. [ 66 ] Out of respect for Mikhail Bakunin , they did not make their differences with collectivist anarchism explicit until after Bakunin\'s death. [ 67 ] By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the "collectivist" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism . \n [ edit ] After Marx \n Marx\'s work sharpened the existing differences between the revolutionary and non-revolutionary socialists. [ citation needed ] \n Non-revolutionary socialists took inspiration from the work of John Stuart Mill , and later John Maynard Keynes and the Keynesians , who provided theoretical justification for (potentially very extensive) state involvement in an existing market economy. [ citation needed ] According to the Keynesians, if the business cycle could be solved by national ownership of key industries and state direction of their investment, class antagonism would be effectively tamed; a compact would be formed between labour and the capitalists. There would be no need for revolution; instead Keynes looked to the eventual "euthanasia of the rentier" sometime in the far future. [ citation needed ] Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki employed Keynesian insights to form the basis of a critical post-Keynesian economics that at times went well beyond liberal reformism. Many original socialist economic ideas would also emerge out of the trade union movement [ citation needed ] (see Guild Socialism ). \n In the wake of Marx, "Marxist" economists developed many different, sometimes contradictory tendencies. [ citation needed ] Some of these tendencies were based on internal disputes about the meaning of some of Marx\'s ideas, including the \'Law of Value\' and his crisis theory. [ citation needed ] Other variations were elaborations that subsequent theorists made in light of real world developments. [ citation needed ] For example the monopoly capitalist school saw Paul A. Baran and Paul Sweezy attempt to modify Marx\'s theory of capitalist development, which was based upon the assumption of price competition, to reflect the evolution to a stage where both economy and state were subject to the dominating influence of giant corporations. World-systems analysis , would restate Marx\'s ideas about the worldwide division of labour and the drive to accumulate from the holistic perspective of capitalism\'s historical development as a global system. [ citation needed ] \n Accordingly, Immanuel Wallerstein , writing in 1979, maintained that "There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world-system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form. Socialism involves the creation of a new kind of world-system, neither a redistributive world-empire nor a capitalist world-economy but a socialist world-government. I don\'t see this projection as being in the least utopian but I also don\'t feel its institution is imminent. It will be the outcome of a long social struggle in forms that may be familiar and perhaps in very few forms, that will take place in all the areas of the world-economy." [ 68 ] \n Meanwhile other notable strands of reformist and revolutionary socialist economics sprung up that were either only loosely associated with Marxism or wholly independent. Thorsten Veblen is widely credited as the founder of critical institutionalism . His idiosyncratic theorizing included acidic critiques of the inefficiency of capitalism, monopolies, advertising, and the utility of conspicuous consumption . Some institutionalists have addressed the incentive problems experienced by the Soviet Union. Critical institutionalists have worked on the specification of incentive-compatible institutions, usually based on forms of participatory democracy, as a resolution superior to allocation by an autonomous market mechanism. [ citation needed ] \n Another key socialist, closely related to Marx, Keynes, and Gramsci , was Piero Sraffa . [ citation needed ] He mined classical political economy, particularly Ricardo, in an attempt to erect a value theory that was at the same time an explanation of the normal distribution of prices in an economy, as well that of income and economic growth. A key finding was that the net product or surplus in the sphere of production was determined by the balance of bargaining power between workers and capitalists, which was in turn subject to the influence of non-economic, presumably social and political factors. The mutualist tradition associated with Proudhon also continued, influencing the development of libertarian socialism , anarchist communism , syndicalism and distributivism . [ citation needed ] \n In the real world, revolutionary socialists were confronted by the necessity of running an economy, and generally a war economy , and developed ideas and practice in response to the situations they found themselves in. [ citation needed ] \n [ edit ] Criticisms \n Main article: Criticism of socialism \n Criticism of socialist economics comes from market economists, including the classicals, neoclassicals and Austrians, as well as from some anarchist economists. Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist, and market socialist economists, for example, criticize centralized economic planning and propose participatory economics and decentralized socialism. \n Market economists generally criticise socialism for eliminating the free market and its price signals, which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes lack of incentive. They believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP. \n Austrian school economists, such as Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises , have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the means of production would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market, it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the economic calculation problem . Polish economist Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner rebutted Mises\' argument by developing the Lange Model during the Economic calculation debate . The Lange model states that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition, in that it achieves Pareto efficiency. \n The neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian school argued, as it is the motivation to act on information.

From "The Difference Between Marxism and Market Socialism" (P.61-63): "More fundamentally, a socialist society must be one in which the economy is run on the principle of the direct satisfaction of human needs...Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology...It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality." \n ^  Socialism and Calculation , on worldsocialism.org. Retrieved February 15, 2010, from worldsocialism.org: http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/overview/calculation.pdf : "Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations...Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness. It is for this that they will be appreciated, evaluated, wanted. . . and produced." \n ^  Kornai, J\xc3\xa1nos: The Socialist System. The Political Economy of Communism .

Part 1: "Here, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form." \n ^  The Political Economy of Socialism , by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (P.197): "The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organization; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labor. Such an organization involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy." \n ^  "What was the USSR" in depth look at various ideas as to what the economy of the Soviet Union was in relation to socialism http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 \n ^  In Defense of Socialist Planning , by Mandel, Ernest. 1986.

With some exceptions, the office was synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union . Throughout its history the office had four other names; Technical Secretary (1917\xe2\x80\x931918), Chairman of the Secretariat (1918\xe2\x80\x931919), Responsible Secretary (1919\xe2\x80\x931922) and First Secretary (1953\xe2\x80\x931966). Joseph Stalin elevated the office to overall command of the Communist Party and by extension the whole Soviet Union. [ 1 ] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History of the office \n 2 List of General Secretaries \n 3 See also \n 4 Notes \n 5 Bibliography \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History of the office \n In its first two incarnations the office performed mostly secretarial work. The post of Responsible Secretary was then established in 1919 to perform administrative work. [ 2 ] In 1922 the office of General Secretary followed as a purely administrative and disciplinary position, whose role was to do no more than determine party membership composition. Stalin, its first incumbent, used the principles of democratic centralism to transform his office into that of party leader, and later leader of the Soviet Union. [ 1 ] \n In 1934, the 17th Party Congress refrained from formally re-electing Stalin as General Secretary. However, Stalin was re-elected into all other positions and remained leader of the party without diniminishment. [ 3 ] \n In the 1950s, Stalin increasingly withdrew from Secretariat business, leaving the supervision of the body to Georgy Malenkov , possibly to test him as a potential successor. [ 4 ] In October 1952, at the 19th Party Congress , Stalin restructured the party\'s leadership. His\'s request, voiced through Malenkov, to be relieved of his duties in the party secretariat due to his age, was rejected by the party congress, as delegates were unsure about Stalin\'s intentions. [ 5 ] In the end, the congress formally abolished Stalin\'s office of General Secretary, though Stalin remained one of the party secretaries and maintained ultimate control of the Party. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Malenkov was the most important member of the Secretariat, which also included Nikita Khrushchev among others. Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers but was forced to resign from the Secretariat on 14 March 1953, leaving Khrushchev in effective control of the body. [ 8 ] Khrushchev was elected to the new office of First Secretary at the Central Committee plenum on 14 September 1953. Originally conceived as a collective leadership , Khrushchev removed his rivals from power in both 1955 and 1957 and reinforced the supremacy of the First Secretary. [ 9 ] \n In 1964 opposition within the Politburo and the Central Committee led to Khrushchev\'s removal as First Secretary. Leonid Brezhnev succeeded Khrushchev to the post and the office was renamed General Secretary in 1966. [ 10 ] During the Brezhnev Era the collective leadership was able to limit the powers of the General Secretary. [ 11 ]  Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko were obliged by protocol to rule the country in the same way as Brezhnev had. [ 12 ]  Mikhail Gorbachev ruled the Soviet Union through the office of General Secretary until 1990, when the Communist Party lost its monopoly of power over the political system. The office of President of the Soviet Union was established so that Gorbachev still retained his role as leader of the Soviet Union. [ 13 ] Following the failed August coup of 1991 , Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary. [ 14 ] He was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Ivashko , who only served for five days as Acting General Secretary before Boris Yeltsin , the President of Russia , suspended all Communist Party activity. [ 15 ] Following the party\'s ban, the Union of Communist Parties \xe2\x80\x93 Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP\xe2\x80\x93CPSU) was established by Oleg Shenin in 1993. The UCP\xe2\x80\x93CPSU works as a framework for reviving and restoring the CPSU. The organisation has members in all the former Soviet republics . [ 16 ] Its current leader is Gennady Zyuganov , who is concurrently First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation . [ 17 ]  \n [ edit ] List of General Secretaries \n \n \n Name \n(birth\xe2\x80\x93death) \n Portrait \n Term of office \n Notes \n \n \n Technical Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (1917\xe2\x80\x931918) \n \n \n Elena Stasova \n(1873\xe2\x80\x931966) [ 18 ] \n  \n April 1917\xe2\x80\x931918 \n As Technical Secretary, Stasova and her staff of four women, were responsible for maintaining correspondence with provincial party cells, assigning work, keeping financial records, distributing Party funds, [ 19 ] formulating party structure policy and appointing new personnel. [ 20 ] \n \n \n Chairman of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (1918\xe2\x80\x931919) \n \n \n Yakov Sverdlov \n(1885\xe2\x80\x931919) [ 21 ] \n  \n 1918 \xe2\x80\x93 16 March 1919 \n Sverdlov remained in office until his death on 16 March 1919. During his tenure he was mainly responsible for technical rather than political matters. [ 22 ] \n \n \n Elena Stasova \n(1873\xe2\x80\x931966) [ 18 ] \n  \n March 1919 \xe2\x80\x93 December 1919 \n When her office was dissolved, Stasova was not considered a serious competitor for the post of Responsible Secretary, the successor office to the Chairman of the Secretariat. [ 23 ] \n \n \n Responsible Secretary of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (1919\xe2\x80\x931922) \n \n \n Nikolay Krestinsky \n(1883\xe2\x80\x931938) [ 24 ] \n  \n December 1919 \xe2\x80\x93 March 1921 \n The office of Responsible Secretary functioned like a secretary , a somewhat menial position given that Krestinsky was also a member of the Party\'s Politburo , Orgburo and Secretariat . Nevertheless, Krestinsky never tried to create an independent power base as Joseph Stalin later did during his time as General Secretary. [ 2 ] \n \n \n Vyacheslav Molotov \n(1890\xe2\x80\x931986) [ 25 ] \n  \n March 1921 \xe2\x80\x93 April 1922 \n Was elected Responsible Secretary at the 10th Party Congress held in March 1921. The Congress decided that the office of Responsible Secretary should have a presence at Politburo plenums. As a result Molotov became a candidate member of the Politburo. [ 26 ] \n \n \n General Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (1922\xe2\x80\x931952) \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n(1878\xe2\x80\x931953) [ 27 ] \n  \n 3 April 1922 \xe2\x80\x93 5 March 1952 \n Stalin used the office of General Secretary to create a strong power base for himself. At the 17th Party Congress in 1934, Stalin was not formally re-elected as General Secretary [ 28 ] and the office was rarely mentioned after that [ 29 ] but Stalin retained all other positions and all of his power. The office was formally abolished at the 19th Party Congress on 16 October 1952, but Stalin remained secretary and retained ultimate power. [ 7 ] \n \n \n First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1953\xe2\x80\x931966) \n \n \n Nikita Khrushchev \n(1894\xe2\x80\x931971) [ 30 ] \n  \n 14 September 1953 \xe2\x80\x93 14 October 1964 \n Khrushchev reestablished the office on 14 September 1953 under the name First Secretary. In 1957 he was nearly removed from office by the Anti-Party Group . Georgy Malenkov , a leading member of the Anti-Party Group, worried that the powers of the First Secretary were virtually unlimited. [ 31 ] Khrushchev was removed as leader on 14 October 1964, and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev. [ 10 ] \n \n \n Leonid Brezhnev \n(1906\xe2\x80\x931982) [ 32 ] \n  \n 14 October 1964 \xe2\x80\x93 8 April 1966 \n The office of First Secretary was renamed General Secretary at the 23rd Party Congress . [ 11 ] \n \n \n General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1966\xe2\x80\x931991) \n \n \n Leonid Brezhnev \n(1906\xe2\x80\x931982) [ 32 ] \n  \n 8 April 1966 \xe2\x80\x93 10 November 1982 \n At first there was no clear leader of the collective leadership with Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin ruling as equals. [ 33 ] However, by the 1970s Brezhnev\'s influence exceeded that of Kosygin\'s and he was able to retain this support by avoiding any radical reforms. The powers and functions of the General Secretary were limited by the collective leadership during Brezhnev\'s tenure. [ 34 ] \n \n \n Yuri Andropov \n(1914\xe2\x80\x931984) [ 35 ] \n  \n 12 November 1982 \xe2\x80\x93 9 February 1984 \n He was seen as the most likely candidate for the General Secretary when it became known he had been the chairman of the committee in charge of arranging, managing and preparing Brezhnev\'s funeral . [ 36 ] Andropov was obliged by protocol to rule the country in the same way Brezhnev had before he died. [ 12 ] \n \n \n Konstantin Chernenko \n(1911\xe2\x80\x931985) [ 32 ] \n  \n 13 February 1984 \xe2\x80\x93 10 March 1985 \n Chernenko was 72 years old when elected to the post of General Secretary and in rapidly failing health. [ 37 ] Chernenko was also obliged by protocol, as Yuri Andropov had been, to rule the country in the same way Brezhnev had. [ 12 ] \n \n \n Mikhail Gorbachev \n(born 1931) [ 38 ] \n  \n 11 March 1985 \xe2\x80\x93 24 August 1991 \n The 1990 Congress of People\'s Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the 1977 Soviet Constitution . This meant that the Communist Party lost its position as the "leading and guiding force of the Soviet society" and the powers of the General Secretary were drastically curtailed. Throughout the rest of his tenure Gorbachev ruled through the office of President of the Soviet Union . [ 13 ] He resigned from his post on 24 August 1991 in the aftermath of the August Coup . [ 14 ] \n \n \n Vladimir Ivashko \n(1932\xe2\x80\x931994) [ 39 ] \n  \n 24 August 1991 \xe2\x80\x93 29 August 1991 \n He was elected Deputy General Secretary, another name for deputy leader, at the 28th Party Congress . Ivashko became acting General Secretary following Gorbachev\'s resignation, but by then the Party was politically impotent and on 29 August 1991 it was banned.

The police were trying to disperse a public assembly during a general strike for the eight-hour workday , when an unidentified person threw a bomb at them. The police reacted by firing on the workers, killing four demonstrators. "Reliable witnesses testified that all the pistol flashes came from the center of the street, where the police were standing, and none from the crowd. Moreover, initial newspaper reports made no mention of firing by civilians. A telegraph pole at the scene was filled with bullet holes, all coming from the direction of the police." [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]  [ 4 ] \n In 1889, the first congress of the Second International , meeting in Paris for the centennial of the French Revolution and the Exposition Universelle , following a proposal by Raymond Lavigne, called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. [ 5 ] May Day was formally recognized as an annual event at the International\'s second congress in 1891. [ citation needed ] \n Subsequently, the May Day Riots of 1894 occurred. In 1904, the International Socialist Conference meeting in Amsterdam called on "all Social Democratic Party organizations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on May First for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace." The congress made it "mandatory upon the proletarian organizations of all countries to stop work on May 1, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers." [ 6 ] \n In many countries, the working classes sought to make May Day an official holiday, and their efforts largely succeeded. May Day has long been a focal point for demonstrations by various socialist , communist and anarchist groups. In Germany, May Day coincides with Walpurgisnacht . [ 7 ] May Day has been an important official holiday in countries such as the People\'s Republic of China , North Korea , Cuba and the former Soviet Union . May Day celebrations typically feature elaborate popular and military parades in these countries [ citation needed ] . \n In the United States and Canada, however, the official holiday for workers is Labor Day in September. This day was promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor , who organized the first parade in New York City . After the Haymarket Massacre, US President Grover Cleveland feared that commemorating Labor Day on May 1 could become an opportunity to commemorate the affair. Thus, in 1887, it was established as an official holiday in September to support the Labor Day that the Knights favored. [ 8 ] \n In 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated May 1 to " Saint Joseph The Worker". The Catholic Church considers Saint Joseph the patron saint of (among others) workers and craftsmen. [ 9 ] \n Far-right governments have traditionally sought to repress the message behind International Workers\' Day, with fascist governments in Portugal, Italy, Germany and Spain abolishing the workers\' holiday. 1 May in the US is celebrated as Loyalty Day . \n [ edit ] Americas \n [ edit ] Argentina \n In Argentina , Workers\' Day is an official holiday. Even when it is associated with labor unions, essentially all workers tend to respect it. During the day, many celebrations related to the labor movements take place, including demonstrations in the biggest cities. It is also customary to organize meetings at friends\' places, at the sports associations, at the workplace, or at the labor unions for typically local food, usually locro or asado . \n The first Workers\' Day celebration was in 1890, when Argentinean unions, controlled in those days by socialists and anarchists, organized several joint celebrations at Buenos Aires and other cities, at the same time that the international labor movement celebrated it for the first time. In 1909, the police killed nine workers during the Workers\' Day celebration in Buenos Aires, in what was the first social massacre of Argentine modern history. [ 10 ] \n In 1930, it was established as official holiday by the first democratic president, the radical Hip\xc3\xb3lito Yrigoyen . The first military dictatorship established in 1930, restricted the Workers\' Day celebration. [ 10 ] \n The day became particularly relevant during the workers-oriented government of Juan D. Per\xc3\xb3n (1946\xe2\x80\x931955). [ 11 ] \n In 1966, the dictatorship lead by general Ongan\xc3\xada, banned the celebration. [ 10 ] \n [ edit ] Bolivia \n May 1 is known as Labour Day and is considered a public holiday. Almost all workers tend to respect it. \n [ edit ] Brazil \n In Brazil , Workers\' Day is an official holiday, and unions commemorate it with day-long public events. It is also when salaries for most professional categories and the minimum wage are traditionally readjusted. \n [ edit ] Canada \n \n \n \n  \nA notice about an anti-capitalist rally on Worker\'s Day in Montreal (2011) \n \n \n Although celebrations by socialist, anarchist and anti-globalization activists occur on May 1 in Canada [ citation needed ] , the government of Prime Minister John Sparrow David Thompson declared in 1894 the first Monday in September as Canada\'s official Labour Day. May Day, however, remains an important day of trade-union and community group protest in the province of Quebec (though not a provincial stat holiday ). Nonetheless, it is the customary date on which the minimum wage rises [ 12 ] . \n Celebration of the International Labour Day (or "International Workers\' Day"; French translation: Journ\xc3\xa9e internationale des travailleurs ) in Montreal goes back to 1906, organised by the Mutual Aid circle. The tradition had a renaissance at the time of a mass strike in 1972. On the 1973 May Day, the first contemporary demonstration was organised by the major trade union confederations; over 30 000 trade unionists took part in this demonstration. \n [ edit ] Chile \n President Carlos Ib\xc3\xa1\xc3\xb1ez del Campo decreed May 1 a national holiday in 1931, in honor of the dignity of workers. [ 13 ] All stores and public services must close for the entire day, and the major trade unions of Chile, represented in the national organization Central Unitaria de Trabajadores , organize rallies during the morning hours, with festivities and cookouts in the later part of the day, in all the major cities of Chile. During these rallies, representatives of the major left-wing political parties speak to the assemblies on the issues of the day concerning workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights. \n [ edit ] Colombia \n May 1 has long been recognized as labor day or Dia del Trabajo and almost all workers respect it as a national holiday. As in many other countries, it is common to see rallies by the trade unions in the main regional capitals of the country. \n [ edit ] Costa Rica \n It is recognized as a public holiday, and at the same time an important Government set of activities, this day the President of the Republic gives a speech to the citizens and the Legislature members about the duties that were taken through the previous year. The president of the Legislature is also chosen by its members. \n [ edit ] Cuba \n This day is known as ( el d\xc3\xada del trabajo ) in Cuba. People march in the streets showing their support to their local socialist government and the revolution during the whole morning. La Habana or Santiago de Cuba are some of the cities where more people march. In 2011, guests from 73 countries and 167 representatives of labor and social organizations worldwide joined the march in Habana. [ 14 ] \n [ edit ] Ecuador \n It is recognized as a public holiday on May 1. D\xc3\xada del Trabajo \n [ edit ] El Salvador \n It is an official holiday and it is commemorated with parades. \n [ edit ] Guatemala \n May 1 is an official public holiday for Labor Day (know as D\xc3\xada del Trabajo ). \n [ edit ] Mexico \n May 1 is a Federal holiday known as D\xc3\xada del Trabajo or Labor Day. It also commemorates the Cananea Mine Strike of 1906 in the Mexican state of Sonora. \n [ edit ] Panama \n May 1 is an official public holiday for Labor Day (know as D\xc3\xada del Trabajo ). \n [ edit ] Peru \n May 1st is an official public holiday for Labor Day ( D\xc3\xada del Trabajo ). \n [ edit ] United States \n \n \n \n  \nSocialists in Union Square, N.Y.C. on May 1st 1912 \n \n \n In the United States, efforts to officially switch Labor Day to the international date of May 1 have not been successful. In 1921, following the Russian Revolution of 1917 , May 1 was promoted as "Americanization Day" by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other groups in opposition to communism . It became an annual event, sometimes featuring large rallies. In 1949, Americanization Day was renamed to Loyalty Day. In 1958, the U.S. Congress declared Loyalty Day, the U.S. recognition of May 1, a national holiday; that same year, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed May 1 Law Day as well. \n Unions and union locals in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 especially in urban areas with strong support for organized labor \xe2\x80\x94 have maintained a connection with labor traditions through their own unofficial observances on May 1. Some of the largest examples of this occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when hundreds of thousands of workers marched in May Day parades in New York\'s Union Square . Groups have kept the May Day tradition alive with rallies and demonstrations in such cities as New York, Chicago and Seattle, often with major union backing. \n In 2006, May 1 was chosen by mostly Latino immigrant groups in the United States as the day for the Great American Boycott , a general strike of undocumented immigrant workers and supporters to protest H.R. 4437 , immigration reform legislation which they felt was draconian. From April 10 to May 1 of that year, millions of immigrant families in the U.S. called for immigrant rights, workers rights and amnesty for undocumented workers. They were joined by socialist and other leftist organizations on May 1. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] On May 1, 2007, a mostly peaceful demonstration in Los Angeles in support of undocumented immigrant workers ended with a widely televised dispersal by police officers . In March 2008, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union announced that dockworkers will move no cargo at any West Coast ports on May 1, 2008, as a protest against the continuation of the Iraq War and the diversion of resources from domestic needs. [ 17 ] For May Day 2010, marches were being planned in many cities uniting immigrant and native workers including New York, [ 18 ]  [ 19 ] San Francisco, [ 20 ] Boston, [ 21 ] Albany [ 22 ] Chicago and Los Angeles most of whom protested against the Arizona Senate Bill 1070 [ 23 ] \n On May 1, 2012, tens of thousands marched in the streets of New York and around the US to commemorate May Day as the worker\'s holiday and to protest the dismal state of the economy, the growing divide between the rich and the poor and the status quo of economic inequality. Members of Occupy Wall Street and labor unions held protests together in a number of cities in the United States and Canada on May 1, 2012 to commemorate May Day. [ 24 ]  [ 25 ] \n [ edit ] Uruguay \n In Uruguay, May 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Workers\' Day \xe2\x80\x93 is an official holiday. Even when it is associated with labor unions, almost all workers tend to respect it. \n Since the late 1990s, the main event takes place at the First of May Square . \n [ edit ] Venezuela \n May 1 is an official holiday in Venezuela. El D\xc3\xada del Trabajador is celebrated on May 1 in Venezuela since 1936, but from 1938 to 1945 it was held on 24 July, by an order of Eleazar L\xc3\xb3pez Contreras . However, Isa\xc3\xadas Medina Angarita changed it back to May 1 in 1945. [ 26 ] \n [ edit ] Asia \n [ edit ] Bahrain \n In Bahrain, May 1 is known as Labour Day and is considered a public holiday. \n [ edit ] Bangladesh \n In Bangladesh, it is observed on 1 May and is a Government holiday. \n [ edit ] Cambodia \n In Cambodia, it is known as International Labour Day and it is a public holiday. \n [ edit ] China \n May 1st is a statutory holiday in the People\'s Republic of China. Prior to 2008, it was a three day holiday, but is now just the one day. However, it is usually supplemented by two other days to give the appearance of a three day holiday, but not being statutory holidays the extra days have to be \'made up\' by working either the preceding or following weekend. \n For example, in 2013, May 1st falls on the Wednesday. Most workplaces, including all government offices, will take Monday 29th April, Tuesday 30th April and Wednesday May 1st off. As the first two days are not statutory holidays they have to be \'made up\' by working the preceding weekend (27th and 28th April). \n [ edit ] Hong Kong \n May 1 is known as Labour Day and has been considered a public holiday since 1999. \n [ edit ] India \n \n \n \n  \n Triumph of Labour at the Marina Beach in Chennai . \n \n \n The first May Day celebration in India was organised in Madras (now Chennai ) by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan on 1 May 1923.

This was applied on Labor Day in 2002, which caused the holiday to be held on April 29; this was protested by labor groups, as they accused the Arroyo administration of belittling the holiday.

It is, in fact, the only day of the year on which employees are legally obliged to be given leave, save professions which cannot be interrupted due to their nature (such as workers in hospitals and public transport). [ 41 ] Demonstrations and marches are a Labour Day tradition in France, where Trade Unions organise parades in major cities to defend workers\' rights. It is also customary to offer a lily of the valley to friends or family. This custom dates back from 1561, where Charles IX, aged 10, waiting for his accession to the throne, gave a lily of the valley to all ladies present. Today, the fiscal administration exempts individuals and workers organizations if any tax or administrative duties related to the sales of lilies of the valley, provided they are gathered from the wild, and not bought to be resold. \n [ edit ] Georgia \n Georgia (a former Soviet state), because of its Soviet past, is not listing 1 May as a public holiday. [ 42 ] \n [ edit ] Germany \n \n \n \n  \nStamp of GDR\'s 1. Mai \n \n \n In April 1933, the recently installed Nazi government declared May 1 the "Day of National Work," an official state holiday, and announced that all celebrations were to be organized by the government. Any separate celebrations by communists, social democrats or labour unions were banned. After the World War II , May 1 remained a state holiday in both East and West Germany . In communist East Germany, workers were de facto required to participate in large state-organized parades on Mayday. Today in Germany it is simply called the "Day of Labour" ( "Tag der Arbeit" ), and there are numerous demonstrations and celebrations by independent workers\' organizations. Today, Berlin witnesses yearly demonstrations on May Day, the largest organized by labour unions, political parties and others by the far left and Autonomen . \n Since 1987, May Day has also become known for riots in some districts of Berlin. After police actions against radical leftists in that year\'s annual demonstrations, the Autonome scattered and sought cover at the ongoing annual street fair in Kreuzberg . Three years prior to the reunification of Germany , violent protests would only take place in the former West Berlin. The protesters began tipping over police cars, violently resisting arrest, and began building barricades after the police withdrew due to the unforeseen resistance. Cars were set on fire, shops plundered and burned to the ground. The police eventually ended the riots the following night. These violent forms of protests by the radical left, later increasingly involved participants without political motivation. (Read more: May Day in Kreuzberg ) \n Annual street fairs have proven an effective way to prevent riots, and May Day in 2005 and 2006 have been among the most peaceful known to Berlin in nearly 25 years. In recent years, neo-Nazis and other groups on the far right , such as the National Democratic Party of Germany , have used the day to schedule public demonstrations, often leading to clashes with left-wing protesters, which turned especially violent in Leipzig in 1998 and 2005. \n May Day violence flared again in 2010. After an approved far right demonstration was blocked by leftists, a parade by an estimated 10,000 leftists and anarchists turned violent and resulted in an active response by Berlin police. [ 43 ] \n [ edit ] Greece \n In Greece May 1 is an optional public holiday. The Ministry of Labour retains the right to classify it as an official public holiday on an annual basis, and it customarily does so [ 44 ] . The day is called "\xce\x95\xcf\x81\xce\xb3\xce\xb1\xcf\x84\xce\xb9\xce\xba\xce\xae \xce\xa0\xcf\x81\xcf\x89\xcf\x84\xce\xbf\xce\xbc\xce\xb1\xce\xb3\xce\xb9\xce\xac" and celebrations are marked by demonstrations to which left-wing political parties, anti-authority groups and workers\' unions participate. On May Day 2010 there were major protests all over Greece, most notably Athens and Thessaloniki, by many left, anarchist and communist supporters and some violent clashes by riot police who were sent out to contain the protesters. They opposed economic reforms, an end to job losses and wage cuts in the face of the government\'s proposals of massive public spending cuts. These reforms are to fall in line with the IMF-EU-ECB loan proposals which demand that Greece liberalize its economy and cut its public spending and private sector wages, which many believe will decrease living standards. [ 45 ] \n [ edit ] Iceland \n In Iceland the Labour Day (Fr\xc3\xaddagur Verkal\xc3\xbd\xc3\xb0sins) is a national holiday. However many stores nowdays are open and pay higher salaries to the workers instead on this day. \n [ edit ] Ireland \n May Day celebrations in Ireland , North and South , are organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions . Rallies take place in Belfast and Dublin and other events such as lectures, concerts and film screenings also take place around a wider May Day festival. A Public holiday is observed on the first Monday in May. \n [ edit ] Italy \n The first May day celebration in Italy took place in 1890. It started initially as an attempt to celebrate workers\' achievements in their struggle for their rights and for better social and economic conditions. It was abolished under the Fascist Regime and immediately restored after the Second World War . (During the fascist period, a "Holiday of the Italian labour" ( Festa del lavoro italiano ) was celebrated on April 21, the date of Natale di Roma , when ancient Rome was allegedly founded.) Now, May Day is an important celebration in Italy. Very popular is the Concerto del Primo Maggio ("1 May\'s Concert"), organized by Italian Labour Unions in Rome in Piazza San Giovanni. It is attended by more than 500,000 people every year, [ citation needed ] and involves participation of many famous bands and songwriters. The concert is usually broadcasted live by Rai 3 . \n [ edit ] Republic of Macedonia \n In Republic of Macedonia, May 1 is an official public holiday.

A free music event also takes place on this date. \n [ edit ] Netherlands \n In the Netherlands, May 1 is not an official holiday. However, several left-wing political parties and organizations celebrate International Workers\' Day yearly. Small demonstrations are sometimes held, mostly by anarchist and radical socialist groups. One of the reasons labour day never got established as a national holiday might be that the day immediately preceding it, Queen\'s Day , is already a public holiday in its own right. \n [ edit ] Norway \n In Norway, Labour Day or "Arbeidernes Dag" is on the 1st of May every year. It is an official public holiday. \n [ edit ] Poland \n In Poland, since the fall of Communism, May 1 is officially celebrated as May Day , but is commonly called Labour Day . [ 46 ]  [ 47 ] \n [ edit ] Portugal \n In Portugal, the May 1 celebration was harshly repressed during the fascist dictatorship regime of Ant\xc3\xb3nio de Oliveira Salazar . Since the Carnation Revolution on 25 April 1974, the Worker\'s Day is now celebrated by the several leftist political parties with parades and demonstrations. The first demonstration after the Carnation Revolution, only one week after the coup, stays until today as the biggest demonstration in the history of Portugal. Remains today an opportunity for the several precarious workers groups to show their discontent for existing working conditions, in a parade called Primeiro de Maio (1 May). Worker\'s Day also represents the unionized workers that try to improve the working conditions of emigrant workers abroad. It is an official public holiday. \n [ edit ] Romania \n In Romania, May 1, known as the International Labour Day ( Ziua interna\xc8\x9bional\xc4\x83 a muncii ), the International Workers\' Day ( Ziua interna\xc8\x9bional\xc4\x83 a oamenilor muncii ), or simply 1/First of May ( 1/\xc3\x8ent\xc3\xa2i Mai ), is an official public holiday . During the communist regime , like in all former Eastern Bloc countries, the day was marked by large state-organized parades in most towns and cities, to which many workers were de facto required to participate. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989 , May 1 continues to be an official public holiday, but without any state organised events or parades. Most people celebrate together with friends and family, organising picnics and barbecues . It is also the first day of the year when people, especially those from the southeastern part of the country including the capital Bucharest , go to spend the day in one of the Romanian Black Sea resorts . \n [ edit ] Russia \n May Day was celebrated illegally in Russia until the February Revolution enabled the first legal celebration in 1917. The following year, after the Bolshevik seizure of power , the May Day celebrations were boycotted by Mensheviks , Left Socialist Revolutionaries and anarchists . It became an important official holiday of the Soviet Union, celebrated with elaborate popular parade in the centre of the major cities. The biggest celebration was traditionally organized on the Red Square , where the General Secretary of the CPSU and other party and government leaders stood atop Lenin\'s Mausoleum and waved to the crowds. Since 1992, May Day is officially called "The Day of Spring and Labour", and remains a major holiday in present-day Russia. \n [ edit ] Serbia \n In Serbia, May 1 is a day off work and a day out of school. It is one of the major popular holidays, and only official holiday from socialist times that is still officialy celebrated. People celebrate it all over the country. By tradition May 1 is celebrated by coutryside picnics and outdoor barbecue. May is marked by warm weather in Serbia. In Belgrade , the capital, most people go to Avala or Ko\xc5\xa1utnjak , which are parks located in Rakovica and \xc4\x8cukarica. People go around the country to enjoy nature. A major religious holiday of Djurdjevdan is on 6 May so quite often days off work are given to connect these two holidays and weekend, creating a small spring break. May 1 is celebrated by most of the population regardless of political views. \n [ edit ] Slovenia \n In Slovenia, May 1 (and also May 2) is a day off work and a day out of school. There are many official celebrations all over the country. In Ljubljana , the capital, most people go to Ro\xc5\xbenik tiny hill over the city. On the evening before (April 30) bonfires are being held on many elevations. \n [ edit ] Spain \n In Spain, the May 1 celebration was established after the end of Franco \'s dictatorship in 1975; before that, it had been celebrated during the Spanish Second Republic period (1931\xe2\x80\x931939), but it was banned afterwards by the fascist Franco regime. The first time it was celebrated was in 1977, when the Communist Party of Spain was legalized. Since then, it has become an official holiday that has been traditionally used by trade unions and leftist parties for social and labour vindications. Commonly, pacific demonstrations and parades occur in major and minor cities. \n [ edit ] Sweden \n May 1 has been an important part of Swedish history since the late 19th century. The day was made a public holiday in 1938 but had been celebrated by the Swedish Social Democratic Party and the left since 1890. The first May Day celebration gathered more than 50.000 people in central Stockholm. The crowd went to hear speeches by the leading figures in the Swedish labour movement such as Hjalmar Branting (later prime minister ), August Palm and Hinke Bergegren . During World War I the demonstrations mainly had a peace message and the Liberal Party also joined the demonstrations. The 8-hour working day and women\'s suffrage were the principal themes during the troubled times after World War I. \n The May Day demonstrations are still an important part of Swedish politics for the social democrats, left-wing parties and unions who use May Day to discuss their politics. In Stockholm the Social Democratic Party always marches towards Norra Bantorget , the centre of the Swedish labour movement, to hold speeches in front of the headquarters of the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, while the smaller [ 48 ]  Left Party rally marches towards Kungstr\xc3\xa4dg\xc3\xa5rden . \n [ edit ] Switzerland \n In Switzerland, the status of May 1 differs depending on the canton and sometimes on the municipality. Labor Day is known as Tag der Arbeit in German-speaking cantons, as F\xc3\xaate du Travail in the French-speaking cantons, and as Festa del lavoro in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino. \n \n In the cantons of Basel-Landschaft , Basel-Stadt , Jura , Neuch\xc3\xa2tel , and Z\xc3\xbcrich , Labor Day is an official public holiday equal to Sundays, based on federal law ( Bundesgesetz \xc3\xbcber die Arbeit in Industrie, Gewerbe und Handel , article 20a). \n In the cantons of Schaffhausen , Thurgau , and Ticino , Labor Day is an official "day off" ( Ruhetag ). This equals in practice to an official public holiday, but is not based on federal law and cantonal regulations may differ in details. \n In the canton of Solothurn it is an official half-day holiday (starting at 12 noon). \n In the canton of Fribourg , public servants get the afternoon off, many companies follow this practice. \n In the canton of Aargau it is not an official holiday, but most employees get the afternoon off. \n In the municipalities of Hildisrieden and Sch\xc3\xbcpfheim (both in the canton of Lucerne ) as well as in Muotathal (canton of Schwyz ), May 1 is an official public holiday, but as commemoration day of the local patron saint , not as Labor Day. In the other parts of the cantons of Lucerne and Schwyz, May 1 is a regular work day. \n In all other cantons, May 1 is a regular work day. \n \n The largest Labor Day celebrations in Switzerland are held in the city of Z\xc3\xbcrich . Each year, Z\xc3\xbcrich\'s May 1 committee, together with the Swiss Federation of Trade Unions , organises a festival and May 1 rally. It is the largest rally held on a regular basis in Switzerland. \n [ edit ] Turkey \n \n \n \n  \nWorkers marching to Taksim Square, May 1, 2012 \n \n \n May 1 is an official holiday celebrated in Turkey. It was a holiday until 1981 when it was cancelled after the 1980 coup-d\'\xc3\xa9tat . In 2010, the Turkish government restored the holiday after some casualties and demonstrations. Taksim Square is the center of the celebrations due to the Taksim Square massacre . \n Workers\' Day was first celebrated in 1912 in \xc4\xb0stanbul , in 1911 in Sel\xc3\xa2nik and in 1899 in \xc4\xb0zmir . After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, it became an official holiday. In 1924, it was forbidden by a decree and in both 1924 and 1925, demonstrations were intervened by arm floats. In 1935, The National Assembly declared Workers\' Day to be a holiday again. [ 49 ] \n During the events leading to the 1980 Turkish coup d\'etat , a massacre occurred on 1 May 1977, (Taksim Square massacre) in which unknown activists opened fire on the crowd. The crowd was the biggest in Turkish Workers\' history with the number of people approximating 500,000. In the next two years, provocations and confusion continued and peaked before the 1980 coup d\'etat. The Workers\' Day holiday was cancelled once again. Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcasted on TV showed that two participants of the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces. Thus, 1 May 1996 has been remembered by workers movements. [ 49 ] \n In 2007, the 30th anniversary of the Taksim square massacre , leftist workers\' unions wanted to commemorate the massacre in Taksim square. Since the government would not let them into the square, 580\xe2\x80\x93700 people were stopped and 1 person died under police control. After these events, the government declared 1 May as "Work and Solidarity Day" but not as a holiday. In the next year, the day was declared as an holiday, but people were still not allowed to gather in Taksim Square. [ 50 ] The year 2008 was remembered with police violence in Istanbul. Police fired tear-gas grenades among the crowds, and into hospitals and a primary school. Workers pushed forward so that in 2010, 140,000 people gathered in Taksim, and in 2011 there were more than half a millon demonstrators. \n [ edit ] United Kingdom \n May Day activities (from 1978) are on the first Monday of the month. This Monday is a bank holiday, a day off school and work. In the United Kingdom in recent years, the anti-capitalist movement has organised a number of large protests in London , Glasgow , Edinburgh , and Doncaster . In London, these have resulted in clashes with the police. [ 51 ] In 2000, the clashes ended with a branch of McDonalds being smashed and a statue of Winston Churchill being given a grass Mohawk hairstyle . The Cenotaph was also defaced with graffiti . [ 52 ] In the last few years, demonstrations have been more peaceful, with marches and gatherings, particularly in central London. [ 53 ] The current Conservative-led coalition government in March 2011 announced plans to move the May Day bank holiday to October in order to lengthen the tourist season. [ 54 ] A London rally on May Day is organised by the London May Day Organising Committee (LMDOC). \n [ edit ] Oceania \n [ edit ] Australia \n While unofficial activities and commemorations associated with International Workers\' Day occur on May Day in Australia, Labour Day in the various states and territories generally fall on other days. Only in the Northern Territory is Labour Day celebrated on the first Monday in May, which is a public holiday under the name of "May Day". \n [ edit ] Africa \n [ edit ] Algeria \n May 1 is a public labour holiday in Algeria.

The President of Egypt traditionally presides over the official May Day celebrations in Cairo ; however, owing to the absence of a president pursuant to the Revolution of 2011 , as well as corruption charges faced by the head of the state-controlled national trade union centre (the Egyptian Trade Union Federation ), the 2011 celebrations were organized by independent unions (united under the banner of the Egyptian Federation for Independent Trades Unions ) for the first time since the Revolution of 1952 . [ 56 ]  [ 57 ] \n [ edit ] Kenya \n In Kenya , May Day is a public holiday and celebrated as the Labour Day. It is a big day addressed by the leaders of the workers umbrella union body- Central Organisation of Trade Unions COTU. The Minister for Labour (and occasionally the President) address the Workers. Each Year, the government approves (and increases) the minimum wage on Labour Day \n [ edit ] Libya \n On May 1, 1978, former Libyan leader Colonel Mu\'ammar Al-Qaddafi addressed the nation in the capital city of Tripoli calling for Administrative and also Economic Reforms across Libya : \n \n We celebrate today the first of May, the International Workers\' Day; but the real workers\' day is the one on which all workers of the world are liberated from slavery and when they become partners instead of wage workers... \nThis should be the Workers\' International Day of Liberation throughout the world which deserves the true celebration. \n \n On September 1, marking the 9th anniversary of Qaddafi\'s rise to leadership, masses responded to the calls made four months prior by revolting and holding mass strikes against many institutions and private owned entities effectively eliminating the Private sector of the economy. \n Four years later, again marking Workers\' Day, Qaddafi gave a historic speech to labourers all over the world asking them to push further with reforms called for in 1978: \n \n On this day we call on the workers of the world who are suffering from deceit, exploitation, oppression and slavery, to rebel against cruel social relations by seizing factories and production units to control their rights over production and form their people\'s congresses and committees (\'No democracy without popular congresses...Committees everywhere!\' [ 58 ]  [ 59 ]  [ 60 ] ). The outbreak of the workers revolution shall sweep the world, destroying forces of exploitation and oppression and raising the banner of the dictum "Partners in production not wage-earners", guided by the second chapter [ 61 ]  [ 62 ]  [ 63 ] of The Green Book . \n \xe2\x80\x94Muammar Qaddafi,&#160; Workers\' International Day of Liberation , May 1, 1982, Tripoli, Libya \n \n [ 64 ] \n International Workers\' Day was declared as a national public holiday on May 1 of each year commencing 2012 by the National Transitional Council of Libya \xe2\x80\x93 the first year of the post-Qaddafi era.

I raised my baton and, in a loud voice, ordered them to disperse as peaceable citizens. I also called upon three persons in the crowd to assist in dispersing the mob. Fielding got down from the wagon, saying at the time, "We are peaceable," as he uttered the last word, I heard a terrible explosion behind where I was standing, followed almost instantly by an irregular volley of pistol shots in our front and from the sidewalk on the east side of the street, which was immediately followed by regular and well directed volleys from the police and which was kept up for several minutes. I then ordered the injured men brought to the stations and sent for surgeons to attend to their injuries. After receiving the necessary attention most of the injured officers were removed to the County Hospital and I highly appreciate the manner in which they were received by Warden McGarrigle who did all in his power to make them comfortable as possible." &#160; \n ^  Foner, Philip S.

S'Socialism vs. Communism \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n The Difference Between Socialism and Communism \n and the cognitive dissonance created by Lenin and Reagan \n \n\n Click here for available Podcasts of Shockave Radio Theater \n\n NEW! Added 11/08: 2008 Republican National Convention Picture Gallery and interviews \n Added 5/07: The Exact Opposite Series: Part I | Part II | Part III | Part IV | Part V | Part VI | Part VII | Part VIII \n\n Read The Heartland Project : Simple Truths for a Shameful Time. \n\n All links were good when this was originally written in April, 2004. \n\n\n Recap from previous column : Liberals are people who are under the only partially mistaken impression that altering the structure of government is the best way to influence people and resources. Conservatives are people who are under the only partially mistaken impression that altering the people in power is the best way to influence other people and their culture. \n\n To put it more simply: Liberals want the decision to be spread out among more people, preferably everyone; conservatives want the decision to be made by as few people as possible, preferably just one. \n\n Socialism, as envisioned by Marx and Engels was, ideally, a where everyone would share the benefits of industrialization. Workers would do better than in the English system at the time (The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848) because there were more workers than bosses and the majority would rule. As a purely economic system, socialism is a lousy way to run a large scale economy. Socialism is not a political system, it\'s a way of distributing goods and services. At their ideal implementation, socialism and laissez faire capitalism will be identical as everyone will produce exactly what\'s needed for exactly who needs it. In practice, both work sometimes in microeconomic conditions but fail miserably when applied to national and international economies. And they fail for the same reason: Human pervserity. Too many people don\'t like to play fair, and both systems only work when everyone follow the same rules. \n\n Socialism is liberal. More people (preferably everyone) have some say in how the economy works. Democracy is liberal. More people (preferably everyone) have some say in how the government works. "Democracy," said Marx, "is the road to socialism." He was wrong about how economics and politics interact, but he did see their similar underpinnings. \n\n Communism is conservative. Fewer and fewer people (preferably just the Party Secretary) have any say in how the economy works. Republicans are conservative. Fewer and fewer people (preferably just people controlling the Party figurehead) have any say in how the government works. The conservatives in the US are in the same position as the communists in the 30s, and for the same reason: Their revolutions failed spectacularly but they refuse to admit what went wrong. \n\n A common mistake is to confuse Socialism, the economic system, with Communism, the political system. Communists are "socialist" in the same way that Republicans are "compassionate conservatives". That is, they give lip service to ideals they have no intention of practicing. \n\n Communism, or "scientific socialism", has very little to do with Marx. Communism was originally envisioned by Marx and Engels as the last stages of their socialist revolution. "The meaning of the word communism shifted after 1917, when Vladimir Lenin and his Bolshevik Party seized power in Russia. The Bolsheviks changed their name to the Communist Party and installed a repressive, single-party regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies." (quote from Encarta .). Those socialist policies were never implemented. \n\n Whereas Marx saw industrialized workers rising up to take over control of their means of production, the exact opposite happened. Most countries that have gone Communist have been agrarian underdeveloped nations. The prime example is the Soviet Union. The best thing to be said about the October Revolution in 1917 is that the new government was better than the Tsars. The worst thing is that they trusted the wrong people, notably Lenin, to lead this upheaval. The Soviet Union officially abandoned socialism in 1921 when Lenin instituted the New Economic Policy allowing for taxation, local trade, some state capitalism... and extreme profiteering. Later that year, he purged 259,000 from the party membership and therefore purged them from voting (shades of the US election of 2000!) and fewer and fewer people were involved in making decisions. \n\n Marxism became Marxist-Leninism which became Stalinism. The Wikipedia entry for Stalinism : "The term Stalinism was used by anti-Soviet Marxists, particularly Trotskyists, to distinguish the policies of the Soviet Union from those they regard as more true to Marxism. Trotskyists argue that the Stalinist USSR was not socialist, but a bureaucratized degenerated workers state that is, a state in which exploitation is controlled by a ruling caste which, while it did not own the means of production and was not a social class in its own right, accrued benefits and privileges at the expense of the working class." \n\n \nCommunists defending Stalin were driven by Cognitive Dissonance . "The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, motivates the person to reduce the dissonance and leads to avoidance of information likely to increase the dissonance." They didn\'t want to hear any criticism, and would go out of their way to deny facts. The abrupt betrayal of ideals by Lenin and Marx left many socialists clinging to the Soviet Union even though they knew Stalin was a disaster. They called themselves Communist even though they espoused none of Stalin\'s viewpoints and very few of Lenin\'s revisionism. In Russia, Lenin remains a Hero of the Revolution. Despite having screwed things up in the first place, Stalin is revered by Communists for toppling the Third Reich. \n\n \nConservatives defending George W. Bush are in the same situation as Communists defending Stalin. Stalin was never a "socialist" and Bush was never a "compassionate conservative", but the conservatives just don\'t want to hear any criticism and will go out of their way to deny facts. The current construction of the conservative movement in the US descends through the anti-Communists during and after WWII, the George Wallace "America First" blue-collar workers, the racists that Wallace picked up that switched parties during Nixon\'s Southern Strategy, and the nascent libertarian movement championed by Barry Goldwater. Ronald Reagan\'s acceptance speech for Goldwater during the 1964 Republican National Convention laid out the insistence of a balanced budget: "There can be no security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and economic stability within the United States." And yet, like Lenin revising Marx, when Reagan was governor of California he didn\'t practice fiscal restraint. And when he was elected president in 1980 he did the exact opposite of his campaign promise and triple the deficit and there has been "no fiscal and economic stability" since his flip-flop. Fiscal restraint was never implemented. \n\n Abrupt betrayal of ideals of Reagan when he got into power left many conservatives clinging to the Republican party even though they espoused none of Reagan\'s new policies. Despite screwing things up in the first place, Reagan remains a Hero of the Revolution and is revered by conservatives for toppling the Soviet Union. \n\n Reagan isn\'t Lenin and Bush isn\'t Stalin, but the parallels are notable. George W. Bush, like Stalin, inherits a failed revolution that relies on a cult-like worship of his predecessors and a complete denial of the facts. \n\n Let me repeat Wikipedia\'s quote. "Stalinism is a state in which exploitation is controlled by a ruling caste.... at the expense of the working class." This is the exact opposite of what Marx and Engels were trying to accomplish, and is precisely what George W. Bush and the Republicans are working so hard for. \n\n Most of the Republicans/conservatives/dittoheads I know are basically good people, but they\'re gullible fools who have spent more than 20 years burying themselves in lies needed to resolve the cognitive dissonance created by Reagan\'s betrayal. Reagan called the Soviet Union an "evil empire", but as we\'ve seen it wasn\'t much of an empire and most of the people in it aren\'t particularly evil. Khrushchev repudiated Stalin after he died in 1953, but wasn\'t strong enough to change the system or the cult worship that kept the dictatorship alive. Republicans need to repudiate Reagan, but there is no one out there who has the guts to tell the truth. The GOP is reduced to whining, flag-waving and outright lying. The shame of being a conservative has never been greater. \n\n Despite Nader\'s protestation, John Kerry and the Democrats do represent a return to American values. It took the Soviet Union 40 years to rot from within before democracy took hold. Let us not wait 40 years before the Republican-controlled US rots from within. The choice is clear. To complete the circle, let me quote the last line of Reagan\'s 1964 speech, which has greater meaning when talking about the need to vote Democrat in 2004: "You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children\'s children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did all that could be done." \n\n \n\n Back to the Political Links page. \n\n \n \n Picture galleries &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp Podcast &nbsp&nbsp Permanent Audio Archive &nbsp&nbsp Audio files \n Dave Romm\'s Portal &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp Shockwave Radio Home Page &nbsp&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp e-mail Baron Dave'

The International intended to fight "by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State." [ 1 ] \n The Comintern was founded after the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference [ clarification needed ] in which Vladimir Lenin had organized the " Zimmerwald Left " against those who refused to approve any statement explicitly endorsing socialist revolutionary action, and after the 1916 dissolution of the Second International . \n The Comintern had seven World Congresses between 1919 and 1935. It also had thirteen "Enlarged Plenums" of its governing Executive Committee , which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses. The Comintern was officially dissolved by Joseph Stalin during 1943. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Organizational history \n \n 1.1 Failure of the Second International \n 1.2 Impact of the Russian Revolution \n 1.3 Founding Congress \n 1.4 Second World Congress \n 1.5 Third World Congress \n 1.6 Fifth to Seventh World Congresses \n \n 1.6.1 The Second Period \n 1.6.2 The Third Period \n \n \n 1.7 Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front \n 1.8 Dissolution \n 1.9 Successor organisations \n \n \n 2 Comintern and Communist Party of China \n \n 2.1 1921 to 1927 \n 2.2 1927 to 1935 \n 2.3 1935 to 1942 \n \n \n 3 Comintern-sponsored international organisations \n 4 World congresses and plenums of Comintern \n 5 See also \n 6 Footnotes \n 7 Further reading \n \n 7.1 Primary sources \n \n \n 8 External links \n \n \n \n \n Organizational history \n Failure of the Second International \n \n \n \n  \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources .

(March 2011)  \n \n \n While the differences had been evident for decades, World War I proved the issue that finally divided the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers\' movement . The socialist movement had been historically antimilitarist and internationalist , and therefore opposed workers serving as "cannon fodder" for the "bourgeois" governments at war. This especially since the Triple Alliance (1882) comprised two empires, while the Triple Entente gathered the French Third Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland into an alliance with the Russian Empire . The Communist Manifesto had stated that "the working class has no country " and exclaimed " Proletarians of all countries, unite! " Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it was declared. \n Nevertheless, within hours of the declarations of war, almost all the socialist parties of the combatant states announced their support for their own respective countries. The only exceptions were the socialist parties of the Balkans , Russia , and tiny minorities in other countries. To Lenin\'s surprise, even the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) voted in favor of war credits. The assassination of French socialist Jean Jaur\xc3\xa8s on July 31, 1914 killed the last hope of peace by removing one of the few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international socialist movement to prevent it from segmenting itself along national lines and supporting governments of National Unity . \n Socialist parties of neutral countries for the most part continued to argue for neutrality rather than for total opposition to the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference , Lenin organized opposition to the " imperialist war" into a movement that became known as the "Zimmerwald Left" and published the pamphlet Socialism and War , in which he called all socialists who collaborated with their national governments " social-chauvinists ", that is, socialists in word but chauvinists in deed. \n The International was dividing into a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a center group wavering between those poles. Lenin condemned much of the center as social-pacifists for several reasons, but partly because while they opposed the war they refused to break party discipline and voted for war credits. The term "social-pacifist" aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald , leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain , who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism but did not actively resist it. \n Discredited by its passivity towards world events, the Second International dissolved in the middle of the war in 1916. In 1917 Lenin published the April Theses , which openly supported a " revolutionary defeatism ": the Bolsheviks pronounced themselves in favor of the defeat of Russia which would permit them to move directly to the stage of a revolutionary insurrection . \n Impact of the Russian Revolution \n The victory of the Russian Communist Party in the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was felt throughout the world. An alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of the Great War, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin , believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism, just as the Paris Commune had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. To this end, the organization of a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world became to the Bolsheviks a necessity. \n Founding Congress \n Main article: Founding Congress of the Comintern \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Core tenets \n \n \n \n Communism \n Vanguard party \n Democratic centralism \n Central planning \n Proletarian internationalism \n Marxist\xe2\x80\x92Leninist atheism \n Single-party state \n Socialist patriotism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Topics \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n Stalinism \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Khrushchevism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Vladimir Lenin \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n Ernst Th\xc3\xa4lmann \n \n \n Earl Browder \n \n \n Gonchigiin Bumtsend \n \n \n Josip Broz Tito \n Fidel Castro \n \n \n Che Guevara \n Mao Zedong \n \n \n Deng Xiaoping \n Ho Chi Minh \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Mathieu K\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9kou \n \n \n Agostinho Neto \n Samora Machel \n \n \n Thomas Sankara \n Alfonso Cano \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Literature \n \n \n \n Wage Labour and Capital \n Materialism and Empirio-criticism \n Imperialism &#160;&#160; (Lenin) \n What Is to Be Done? \n The State and Revolution \n \n Dialectical and \nHistorical Materialism \n \n On Contradiction \n Guerrilla Warfare \n \n Fundamentals of \nMarxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History \n \n \n \n Great October Socialist Revolution \n \n \n Soviet Union \n Comintern \n \n \n Hungarian Soviet Republic \n \n \n Spanish Civil War \n World War II \n \n \n Warsaw Pact \n Greek Civil War \n \n \n Chinese Revolution \n \n \n Korean War \n Cuban Revolution \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n \n \n Non-Aligned Movement \n \n \n Sino-Soviet split \n Vietnam War \n \n \n Portuguese Colonial War \n \n \n Nicaraguan Revolution \n \n \n Nepalese Civil War \n \n \n Naxalite-Maoist insurgency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Bolshevism \n Leninism \n \n \n Maoism \n Marxism \n \n \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Titoism \n Trotskyism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communism portal \n Politics portal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n The Comintern was founded in these conditions at a Congress held in Moscow March 2\xe2\x80\x936, 1919, [ 2 ] against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War . There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties. [ 3 ] They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, Trotsky and Christian Rakovsky later delegated the task of managing the International to Grigory Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff , acting as the secretary of the International, Victor L. Kibaltchitch [ 4 ] and Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin . [ 5 ] Lenin, Trotsky and Alexandra Kollontai presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between " bourgeois democracy " and the " dictatorship of the proletariat ". [ 6 ] \n The following parties and movements were invited to the Founding Congress: \n \n  Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) \n  Spartacus League ( Germany ) \n  Communist Party of German Austria \n  Hungarian Communist Workers\' Party , in power during B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s  Hungarian Soviet Republic \n  Communist Party of Finland \n  Communist Party of Poland \n  Communist Party of Estonia \n  Communist Party of Latvia \n  Lithuanian CP \n  Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Byelorussia \n  Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (Ukrainian section of Russian CP, same party basically) \n  The revolutionary elements of the Czech social democracy \n  Social Democratic and Labour Party of Bulgaria ( Tesnyatsi ) \n  Romanian Social Democratic Party \n  Left-wing of the Serbian SDP \n  Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden \n  The Norwegian Labour Party \n  For Denmark , the Klassekampen group \n  Communist Party of the Netherlands \n  Revolutionary elements of the Belgian Labour Party (who would create the Communist Party of Belgium in 1921) \n  Groups and organisations within the French socialist and syndicalist movements \n  Left wing within the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland \n  Italian Socialist Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Spanish Socialist Workers\' Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Portuguese Socialist Party \n  British socialist parties (particularly the current represented by John Maclean ) \n  Socialist Labour Party (Great Britain) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (Great Britain) \n  Revolutionary elements of the workers\' organisations of Ireland \n  Revolutionary elements among the Shop stewards (Great Britain) \n  Socialist Labor Party of the United States \n  Left elements of the Socialist Party of America (the tendency represented by Eugene Debs and the Socialist Propaganda League of America ) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (United States) \n  Industrial Workers of the World ( Australia ) \n  Workers\' International Industrial Union (United States) \n  The Socialist groups of Tokyo and Yokohama ( Japan , represented by Sen Katayama ) \n Socialist Youth International (represented by Willi M\xc3\xbcnzenberg ) [ 7 ] \n \n Of these, the following attended: the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, the Volga German region; the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (the opposition), Balkan Revolutionary People\'s of Russia; Zimmerwald Left Wing of France; the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French and Swiss Communist Groups; the Dutch Social-Democratic Group; Socialist Propaganda League and the Socialist Labor Party of America; Socialist Workers\' Party of China; Korean Workers\' Union, Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijanian and Persian Sections of the Central Bureau of the Eastern People\'s, and the Zimmerwald Commission. [ 3 ]  [ 8 ] \n Grigory Zinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern\'s Executive Committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in What Is to Be Done? (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin\'s leadership was that Communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international proletarian revolution . The parties also shared his principle of democratic centralism , "freedom of discussion, unity of action", that is, that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made. [ 9 ] In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the " General Staff of the World Revolution ." [ 10 ] \n Second World Congress \n \n Main article: 2nd World Congress of the Comintern . \n \n \n \n \n  \nSecond Congress of the Communist International. 1920. \n \n \n Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. The Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between Communist parties and other socialist groups, [ 11 ] and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organisations along democratic centralist lines, in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership. \n Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the second congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M.N. Roy , who attended as a delegate of the Communist Party of Mexico . The congress removed the term \xe2\x80\x98bourgeois-democratic\' in what became the 8th condition. [ 12 ] \n Many European socialist parties went through splits on the basis of the adhesion or not to the new International. The French Section of the Workers International (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 Tours Congress , leading to the creation of the new French Communist Party (initially called "French Section of the Communist International" - SFIC); the Communist Party of Spain was created in 1920, the Communist Party of Italy was created in 1921, the Belgian Communist Party in September 1921, etc. \n Third World Congress \n Writings from the Third Congress, held in June\xe2\x80\x93July 1921, talked about how the struggle could be transformed into "civil war" when the circumstances were favorable and "openly revolutionary uprisings". [ 13 ] The Fourth Congress, November 1922, at which Leon Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein. [ 14 ] \n The Dungan commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, Magaza Masanchi , attended the Third Congress. [ 15 ] \n During this early period, known as the "First Period" in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik revolution under attack in the Russian Civil War and a wave of revolutions across Europe , the Comintern\'s priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some Communist Parties had secret military wings. On example is the M-Apparat of the Communist Party of Germany . Its purpose was to prepare for the civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany, and to liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party. There was also a paramilitary organization, the Rotfrontk\xc3\xa4mpferbund . [ 16 ] \n The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader, B\xc3\xa9la Kun . Soon an official "Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government" was formed, unofficially known as " Lenin Boys ". [ 17 ] The next attempt was the " March Action " in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former Chairman, Paul Levi , from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet, [ 18 ] which was ratified by the ECCI prior to the 3rd congress. [ 19 ] A new attempt was made at the time of the Ruhr Crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200-300 Communists attacked police stations but were quickly defeated. [ 20 ] In 1924 there was a failed coup in Estonia by the Estonian Communist Party . [ 21 ] \n In 1924, the Mongolian People\'s Revolutionary Party joined Comintern. [ 22 ] At first, in China both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were supported. After the definite break with Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Stalin sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed. [ 23 ] \n Fifth to Seventh World Congresses \n The Second Period \n \n \n \n  \nThe Comintern membership card of Karl Kilbom \n \n \n Lenin died in 1924. 1925 signalled a shift from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that year, Joseph Stalin upheld the thesis of " socialism in one country ", detailed by Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat? (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin\'s January 1926 article On the Issues of Leninism . The perspective of a world revolution was dismissed after the failures of the Spartacist uprising in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the reflux of all revolutionary movements in Europe, such as in Italy , where the fascist squadristi broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following the 1922 March on Rome ). This period, up to 1928, was known as the "Second Period", mirroring the shift in the USSR from war communism to the New Economic Policy . [ 24 ] \n At the 5th World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned Marxist philosopher Georg Luk\xc3\xa1cs \'s History and Class Consciousness , published in 1923 after his involvement in B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s Hungarian Soviet Republic , and Karl Korsch \'s Marxism and Philosophy . [ citation needed ] Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin, who already held considerable power by this time. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years, until 1928 when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution. \n Geoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: \n \n By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924... the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of "Bolshevization" was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of "internal rectification" began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928. [ 25 ] \n \n The Third Period \n In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee began the so-called " Third Period ", which was to last until 1935. [ 26 ] The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse, and that as such, the correct stance for all Communist parties was that of a highly aggressive, militant, ultra-left line. In particular, the Comintern described all moderate left-wing parties as " social fascists ", and urged the Communists devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. With the rise of the Nazi movement in Germany after 1930, this stance became somewhat controversial with many, such as the Polish Communist historian Isaac Deutscher , criticizing the tactics of the Communist Party of Germany of treating the Social Democratic Party of Germany as the principal enemy. [ citation needed ] \n The 6th World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The congress did however make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally but not a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian Communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists. [ 27 ] \n Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front \n The seventh and last congress of the Comintern was held between July 25 and August 20, 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti , Wilhelm Pieck and Dmitry Manuilsky . [ 28 ] The congress officially endorsed the Popular Front against fascism. This policy argued that Communist Parties should seek to form a Popular Front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a United Front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern; in France and Spain in particular, it would have momentous consequences with L\xc3\xa9on Blum \'s 1936 election, which led to the Popular Front government . \n Stalin\'s purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the USSR and overseas. At Stalin\'s direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser , using the pseudonym \'Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin\', was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later, the NKVD ). At Stalin\'s orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge . Several hundred German Communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated, and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany. [ 29 ]  Fritz Platten died in a labor camp; the leaders of the Indian ( Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish Communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. A great number of German Communists were handed over to Adolf Hitler . Leopold Trepper recalled these days: "In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o\'clock in the morning.... Exactly 3 o\'clock the car lights began to be seen... we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped." [ 30 ] \n Dissolution \n At the start of World War II , the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention , arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, much like World War I had been. But when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the Allies . On May 15, 1943, a declaration of the Executive Committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of Comintern. The declaration read: \n \n The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers\' parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.... But long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles. \n \n Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: \n \n To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International. \n \n After endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved. [ 31 ] Messages between Tito and Dimitrov the Secretary-General in Moscow were intercepted and decrypted by the British GC&amp;CS ( Bletchley Park ) from 1943, though the volume of messages was not great (the first message from "Walter" [Tito] was intercepted on 21 April, though not decrypted until many months later). They showed the level of control exercised over him (Tito) by Moscow and continued with Dimitrov after June 1943, when the Comintern itself was dissolved. [ 32 ] \n Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill ) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries. [ 33 ] \n Successor organisations \n The International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown. [ 34 ] \n In September 1947, following the June 1947 Paris Conference on Marshall Aid , Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties and set up the Cominform , or Communist Information Bureau , often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the Communist parties of Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , France , Hungary , Italy , Poland , Romania , the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia (led by Josip Broz Tito , it was expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956, following Stalin\'s 1953 death and the XXth Congress of the CPSU . \n While the Communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after dissolution of Comintern, periodical meetings of Communist parties were held in Moscow . Moreover World Marxist Review , a joint periodical of the Communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Socialist Bloc in 1989-1991. \n Comintern and Communist Party of China \n The complicated relationship between the Comintern and the Communist Party of China (CPC) is an important chapter in the history of Comintern. \n 1921 to 1927 \n The CPC was established in 1921 with the help of the Comintern. The CPC declared itself to be a branch of the Comintern. At that time, China had a large revolutionary party called the Chinese Nationalist Party ( Kuomintang ). Its leader, Dr. Sun Yatsen , frustrated by the refusal of aid for China from the democratic Western countries, quickly turned to the Soviet Union and the Comintern. Under the instruction of the Comintern, [ citation needed ] the CPC joined the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang also applied for membership in the Comintern, but was not accepted since it was essentially considered to be an anti-colonialist bourgeois political party and not a true Marxist vehicle. Sun Yatsen\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Chiang Kai-shek , was once elected as an honorary member of the standing committee of the Comintern. [ citation needed ] \n The Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Joseph Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin followed a practical policy, ignoring communist ideology. He told the Chinese Communist Party to stop whining about the lower classes and follow the Kuomintang \'s orders. Stalin, like Vladimir Lenin , believed that the KMT bourgeoisie would defeat the western imperialists in China and complete the revolution. Trotsky wanted the Communist party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and opposed the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. [ 35 ] Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang\'s right wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 1927 by massacring the Communist party in Shanghai midway in the Northern Expedition. [ 36 ]  [ 37 ] \n 1927 to 1935 \n After the success of the joint revolution of the Kuomintang and CPC in reuniting China under a single government, they split over their ideological differences. The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek ultimately became an anti-Communist force. The Comintern instructed the Communists to initiate urban riots, but all failed. [ citation needed ] A group of \xe2\x80\x9cnative Communists\xe2\x80\x9d, such as Mao Zedong , used peasant riots to establish the Soviet Republic of China in remote mountain villages. The Comintern sent a German Communist, Otto Braun , as the CPC\'s military adviser, who became the CPC\'s de facto military commander later. [ citation needed ] Zhou Enlai , once the Comintern\'s favorite, [ citation needed ] was the chairman of the Military Committee of the CPC. After being besieged by Chiang Kai-shek\xe2\x80\x99s Nationalist army, the Chinese Red Army had to escape to try to find a new base - this came to be known as the Long March (1934\xe2\x80\x931935). \n 1935 to 1942 \n During the Long March, the CPC party leadership re-examined its policy in Zunyi (January 1935). Mao Zedong blamed the CPC\'s failure to ignite a revolution on their decision to blindly follow the Comintern\'s instructions, which did not take into account the reality of Chinese conditions. During the heated debate, Zhou Enlai unexpectedly accepted the criticism and sided with Mao. Otto Braun was dismissed from his position as the CPC\'s military commander. \n After they resettled in Yanan , the native Chinese Communists, such as Mao and Zhu De , became the real powers in the CPC rather than the foreign Communists supplied by the Comintern. Those Chinese Communists who were loyal to the Comintern, such as a group called the 28 Bolsheviks , fell from all of the most important positions within the CPC. Zhou Enlai became an assistant to Mao in political affairs, such as the pursuit of the United Front and diplomacy. By this time, the Comintern and the Soviet Union could no longer control the CPC. The Comintern continued to give advice, but much of it was simply ignored. The CPC was now a truly Chinese entity, much as the Bolshevik Party had been a truly Russian one. \n An exception to this rule was the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army , organized by the Manchuria branch of the CPC in 1932. Geographically separated from the CPC headquarters in Yenan , this guerrilla army did not report directly to the CPC center, but was still led and supported by the Soviet Union under the guise of the Comintern until it was defeated by a Japanese occupation force and fled to the Soviet Union in 1942. \n Comintern-sponsored international organisations \n Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period: \n \n Communist Youth International (1919\xe2\x80\x931943) \n Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern - formed 1920) \n Communist Women\'s International (formed 1920) \n International Red Aid (MOPR - formed 1922) \n Red Peasant International (Krestintern - formed 1923) \n Red Sports International (Sportintern) \n International of the Proletarian Freethinkers (1925\xe2\x80\x931933) \n League against Imperialism (formed 1927) \n \n World congresses and plenums of Comintern \n Delegate figures are voting plus consultative.

The term "purge" has taken on very negative connotations, because of the Great Purge of the 1930s. In the early 1920s, however, the term was more ambiguous. See J.

Workers should struggle in solidarity with their fellow workers in other countries on the basis of a common class interest . \n Proletarian internationalism is closely linked to Marxist goals of world revolution , to be achieved through successive or simultaneous communist revolutions in all nations. Marxist theory is that world revolution would lead to world communism , and later still, stateless communism . [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] \n Marxists regard proletarian internationalism as the antonym of bourgeois nationalism but the term has been subjected to different interpretations by various currents of Marxist thought. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Marx and Engels \n 2 First International \n 3 Second International \n 4 First World War \n 5 Third International: Leninism versus Left Communism \n 6 Socialist internationalism \n 7 Proletarian internationalism today \n 8 Leftist opposition to proletarian internationalism \n 9 See also \n 10 Footnotes \n 11 References and external links \n \n \n \n \n Marx and Engels \n Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan coined by Marx and Engels, Workers of all countries, unite! , the last line of The Communist Manifesto , published in 1848. However, Marx and Engels\' approach to the national question was also shaped by tactical considerations in their pursuit of a long-term revolutionary strategy. In 1848, the proletariat was a small minority in all but a handful of countries. Political and economic conditions needed to ripen in order to advance the possibility of proletarian revolution. \n Thus, for example, Marx and Engels supported the emergence of an independent and democratic Poland, which at the time was divided between Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary. Rosa Luxemburg\'s biographer Peter Nettl writes, "In general, Marx and Engels\' conception of the national-geographical rearrangement of Europe was based on four criteria: the development of progress, the creation of large-scale economic units, the weighting of approval and disapproval in accordance with revolutionary possibilities, and their specific enmity to Russia." [ 3 ] Russia was seen as the heartland of European reaction at the time. \n First International \n The trade unionists who formed the International Workingmen\'s Association (IWA), sometimes called the First International , recognised that the working class was an international class which had to link its struggle on an international scale. By joining together across national borders, the workers would gain greater bargaining power and political influence. \n Founded in 1864, the IWA was the first mass movement with a specifically international focus. At its peak, the IWA had 5 million members, according to police reports from the various countries in which it had a significant presence. [ 4 ] Repression in Europe and internal divisions between the anarchist and Marxist currents led eventually to its dissolution in 1876. Shortly thereafter, the Marxist and revolutionary socialist tendencies continued the internationalist strategy of the IWA through the successor organisation of the Second International, though without the inclusion of the anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movements. \n Second International \n Proletarian internationalism was perhaps best expressed in the resolution sponsored by Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg at the Seventh Congress of the Second International at Stuttgart in 1907. This asserted that: \n \n "Wars between capitalist states are, as a rule, the outcome of their competition on the world market, for each state seeks not only to secure its existing markets, but also to conquer new ones. In this, the subjugation of foreign peoples and countries plays a prominent role. These wars result furthermore from the incessant race for armaments by militarism, one of the chief instruments of bourgeois class rule and of the economic and political subjugation of the working class. \n \n \n "Wars are favored by the national prejudices which are systematically cultivated among civilized peoples in the interest of the ruling classes for the purpose of distracting the proletarian masses from their own class tasks as well as from their duties of international solidarity. \n \n \n "Wars, therefore, are part of the very nature of capitalism; they will cease only when the capitalist system is abolished or when the enormous sacrifices in men and money required by the advance in military technique and the indignation called forth by armaments, drive the peoples to abolish this system." \n \n The resolution concluded that: \n \n "If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their parliamentary representatives in the countries involved, supported by the coordinating activity of the International Socialist Bureau, to exert every effort in order to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective, which naturally vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the sharpening of the general political situation. \n \n \n "In case war should break out anyway, it is their duty to intervene in favor of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war to rouse the masses and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule." [ 5 ] \n \n In fact, Luxemburg and Lenin had very different interpretations of the national question. Lenin and the Bolsheviks opposed imperialism and chauvinism by advocating a policy of national self-determination, including the right of oppressed nations to secede from Russia. They believed this would help to create the conditions for unity between the workers in both oppressing and oppressed nations. Specifically, Lenin claimed \xe2\x80\x9cThe bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression and it is this content that we unconditionally support." [ 6 ] By contrast, Luxemburg broke with the mainstream Polish Socialist Party (PPS) in 1893 on the national question. \n Luxemburg argued in that the nature of Russia had changed since Marx\xe2\x80\x99s day. Russia was now fast developing as a major capitalist nation, while the Polish bourgeoisie now had its interests linked to Russian capitalism. This had opened the possibility of a class alliance between the Polish and Russian working class. \n In the event the leading party of the Second International, the SPD , voted overwhelmingly in support of Germany\'s entry into the First World War by approving war credits on 4 August 1914. Many other member parties of the Second International followed suit by supporting national governments and the Second International was dissolved in 1916. Proletarian internationalists characterized the combination of social democracy and nationalism as social chauvinism . \n First World War \n The hopes of internationalists such as Lenin, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were dashed by the initial enthusiasm for war. Lenin tried to re-establish socialist unity against the war at the Zimmerwald conference but the majority of delegates took a pacifist rather than a revolutionary position. \n In prison, Luxemburg deepened her analysis with the Junius Pamphlet of 1915. In this document she specifically rejects the notion of oppressor and oppressed states: "Imperialism is not the creation of one or any group of states. It is the product of a particular stage of ripeness in the world development of capital, an innately international condition, an indivisible whole, that is recognisable only in all its relations, and from which no nation can hold aloof at will." [ 7 ] \n Proletarian internationalists now argued that the alliances of the First World War had proved that socialism and nationalism were incompatible in the imperialist era, that the concept of national self-determination had become outdated, and in particular, that nationalism would prove to be an obstacle to proletarian unity. Anarcho-syndicalism was a further working class political current that characterised the war as imperialist on all sides, finding organisational expression in the Industrial Workers of the World . \n The internationalist perspective influenced the revolutionary wave towards the end of the First World War, notably with Russia\'s withdrawal from the conflict following the Bolshevik revolution and the revolt in Germany beginning in the naval ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven that brought the war to an end in November 1918. However, once this revolutionary wave had receded in the early 1920s, proletarian internationalism was no longer mainstream in working class politics. \n Third International: Leninism versus Left Communism \n \n \n \n  \nThe polyethnic nature of Budapest in 1919. During the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919 the Millennium Monument was completely covered by red textile and at the basement of the obelisk a new statue was erected: Marx with a worker and a peasant. The statues of Hungarian historic national heroes were toppled. The Hungarian national symbols were banned. \n \n \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Anarcho-communism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Concepts \n \n \n \n Anarchy \n Anti-authoritarianism \n \n \n Anti-capitalism \n Anti-statism \n \n \n Proletarian internationalism \n \n \n Class consciousness \n \n \n Class struggle \n Classless society \n \n \n Common ownership \n Commons \n \n \n Commune \n Consensus democracy \n \n \n Co-operative economics \n \n \n Direct democracy \n \n \n Egalitarian community \n \n \n Free association \n Free store \n \n \n \n " From each according to his ability, \nto each according to his need " \n \n \n \n Mass strike \n Gift economy \n \n \n Market abolitionism \n Mutual aid \n \n \n \n \n Prefigurative politics \n Primitive communism \n Stateless communism \n Stateless society \n Workers\' control \n Worker cooperative \n Workers\' council \n Wage slavery \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Joseph D\xc3\xa9jacque \n Peter Kropotkin \n \n \n Carlo Cafiero \n Errico Malatesta \n \n \n Emma Goldman \n Luigi Galleani \n \n \n Ricardo Flores Mag\xc3\xb3n \n \n \n Alexander Berkman \n \n \n Buenaventura Durruti \n Volin \n \n \n S\xc3\xa9bastien Faure \n Nestor Makhno \n \n \n Murray Bookchin \n Albert Meltzer \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Organizational forms \n \n \n \n Insurrectionary anarchism \n Platformism \n Synthesis federations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Theoretical works \n \n \n \n The Conquest of Bread \n Fields, Factories and Workshops \n Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution \n Anarchism and Other Essays \n Now and After \n The Right To Be Greedy \n Post-Scarcity Anarchism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anarchism \n Autonomism \n \n \n \n \n Communization \n Council communism \n Left communism \n Libertarian socialism \n Social anarchism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n Following the First World War the international socialist movement was irreconcilably split into two hostile factions: on the one side, the social democrats , who broadly supported their national governments during the conflict; and on the other side Leninists and their allies who formed the new Communist Parties that were organised into the Third International , which was established in March 1919. However, during the Russian Civil War Lenin and Trotsky more firmly embraced the concept of national self-determination for tactical reasons. In the Third International the national question became a major bone of contention between mainstream Leninists and " left communists ". However the latter soon became an isolated minority, either falling into line or leaving the International. \n By the time the Second World War broke out in 1939 only a few prominent communists such as the Italian Marxist Amadeo Bordiga and the Dutch council communist Anton Pannekoek remained opponents of Russia\'s use of the tactics of national self-determination. But in 1943, following the collapse of the Mussolini regime in Italy, Bordigists regrouped and founded the Internationalist Communist Party (PCInt). The first edition of the party organ, Prometeo (Prometheus) proclaimed: "Workers! Against the slogan of a national war which arms Italian workers against English and German proletarians, oppose the slogan of the communist revolution, which unites the workers of the world against their common enemy \xe2\x80\x94 capitalism." [ 8 ] The PCInt took the view that Luxemburg, not Lenin, had been right on the national question. \n Socialist internationalism \n Socialist internationalism allegedly regulated relationship between socialist countries. [ 9 ] In reality Soviet Union controlled smaller countries using the Warsaw Pact and Comecon , invading Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. The Sino-Soviet split in 1950s and 1960s produced two groups of socialist countries. \n Proletarian internationalism today \n Some political groupings such as the International Communist Party, the International Communist Current and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party (which includes the PCInt) follow the Luxemburgist and Bordigist interpretations of proletarian internationalism, as do some libertarian communists . \n Leftist opposition to proletarian internationalism \n In contrast, some socialists have pointed out that social realities such as local loyalties and cultural barriers militate against proletarian internationalism. For example, George Orwell believed that "in all countries the poor are more national than the rich." [ 10 ] To this, Marxists might counter that while the rich may have historically had the awareness and education to recognize cross-national interest of class, the poor of those same nations likely have not had this advantage, making them more susceptible to what Marxists would describe as the false ideology of patriotism. Marxists assert that patriotism and nationalism serve precisely to obscure opposing class interests that would otherwise pose a threat to the ruling class order. \n Marxists would also point out that in times of intense revolutionary struggle (the most evident being the revolutionary periods of 1848-9, 1917\xe2\x80\x931923 and 1968) internationalism within the proletariat can overtake petty nationalisms as intense class struggles break out in multiple nations at the same time and the workers of those nations discover that they have more in common with other workers than with their own bourgeoisie. \n On the question of imperialism and national determination, proponents of third worldism argue that workers in "oppressor" nations (such as the USA or Israel) must first support national liberation movements in "oppressed" nations (such as Afghanistan or Palestine) before there can be any basis for proletarian internationalism. For example, Tony Cliff , a leading figure of the British Socialist Workers Party , denied the possibility of solidarity between Palestinians and Israelis in the current Middle East situation, writing "Israel is not a colony suppressed by imperialism, but a settler\xe2\x80\x99s citadel, a launching pad of imperialism. It is a tragedy that some of the very people who had been persecuted and massacred in such bestial fashion should themselves be driven into a chauvinistic, militaristic fervour, and become the blind tool of imperialism in subjugating the Arab masses." [ 11 ] \n Trotskyists argue that there must be a permanent revolution in third world countries, in which a bourgeoisie revolution will inevitably lead to a worker\'s revolution with an international scope. We may see this in the Bolshevik Revolution before the movement was stopped by Stalin, a proponent of Socialism in One Country . Because of this threat, the bourgeoisie in third world countries will willingly subjugate themselves to national and capitalist interests in order to prevent a proletarian uprising. \n Internationalists would respond that capitalism has proved itself incapable of resolving the competing claims of different nationalisms, and that the working class (of all countries) is oppressed by capitalism, not by other workers. Moreover, the global nature of capitalism and international finance make "national liberation" an impossibility. [ 12 ] For internationalists, all national liberation movements, whatever their "progressive" gloss, are therefore obstacles to the communist goal of world revolution. \n See also \n \n Marxism \n Communism \n Global Citizens Movement \n Socialist International \n Social Patriotism \n \n Footnotes \n \n \n ^  N.I.

If you\'ve never read the Communist Manifesto , take two hours and read it--it\'s just a 50-page pamphlet. You can buy it at most bookstores for a couple bucks, or read it online at www.marxists.org --or better yet, order Phil Gasper\'s annotated version from HaymarketBooks.org. \n \n \n  Series:  Ten socialist classics \n \n \nSocialistWorker.org writers introduce 10 of the most important writings by leading thinkers in the revolutionary socialist tradition. The Communist Manifesto \n Socialism: Utopian and Scientific \n Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State \n The Civil War in France \n The Mass Strike \n Reform or Revolution \n State and Revolution \n What Is To Be Done? \n Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism \n Permanent Revolution \n \n \n \n My bet is that you will find at least 10 things that make you say, "That is exactly what I\'ve always thought!" \n More than that, when you finish reading it, you\'ll think, "Sure, some things have changed, but my God--the Communist Manifesto is more relevant, truthful and inspiring than anything I\'ve ever read by an American politician. No wonder they don\'t assign this as reading in high school history class!" \n Then you\'ll understand why South African coal miners, the unemployed of Indonesia, South Korean teachers, French railroad workers, Indian trade unionists and Cuban radicals have all looked to Karl Marx for inspiration. \n Why in 1920, 1 million Americans--from New England textile workers to Oklahoman small farmers--voted for Eugene V. Debs, the most famous Marxist in America. Why thousands of Pennsylvania coal miners joined the Communist Party in the 1920s and \'30s. Why Paul Robeson and W.E.B. DuBois urged people to study Karl Marx. Why the Black Panther Party made the Communist Manifesto required reading for members. \n And why Venezuelan President Hugo Ch&aacute;vez told a cheering crowd of 15,000 people at the World Social Forum in Caracas in January 2006: "Karl Marx is more relevant today than ever before, so the question is: socialism or death--but death of the human race, the death of the planet, because capitalism...is destroying the ecology of the planet. We must raise up a new banner of socialism--a new way for the 21st century, the building of a firm movement of real socialism on the planet." \n \n \n  \n  What else to read \n     \n  \n Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, The Communist Manifesto \n Frederick Engels, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific \n Frederick Engels, The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State \n Karl Marx, The Civil War in France \n Rosa Luxemburg, The Mass Strike \n Rosa Luxemburg, Reform or Revolution \n Vladimir Lenin, State and Revolution \n Vladimir Lenin, What Is to Be Done \n Vladimir Lenin, Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism \n All three works by Vladimir Lenin can be found in Essential Works of Lenin: "What Is to Be Done?" and Other Writings \n Leon Trotsky, Permanent Revolution \n \n   \n If I win the bet, all you have to do is find some way to actively participate in changing the world for the better. If I lose (which I won\'t), then I\'ll read anything you send me that you think is better than Marx, and start a dialogue with you about it (unless you\'re a right-wing crank, and then, I really don\'t care what you think). \n Why am I so confident? Because Karl Marx and Frederick Engels do two things in the Communist Manifesto : They first identify many of the issues facing working-class people living under capitalism, and they then provide a theory to tie it all together--to understand where human society has come from, how it got to this point, and how it can be changed. \n Not bad in 50 pages. \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n CONSIDER HOW relevant the Communist Manifesto reads on issues in the headlines today: \n Sexism \nSeventy years before women were even allowed to vote in the U.S., the Manifesto took up the idea of freeing women from sexual abuse perpetrated against them by wealthy and powerful men. Marx and Engels called for equality--and to "do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production." \n In later works, Marx, and especially Engels, blazed new trails in understanding the "historic defeat of the female sex," as Engels put it, as a consequence of the rise of a class society divided between rich and poor--and arguing that only socialist equality could ever fully end sexism. \n More than a century and a half later, women in the U.S. still earn only 70 cents on the dollar compared to men, and the corporate media treats even a woman as powerful as Hillary Clinton with a disgusting, paternalistic double standard. \n Nationalism, Racism and War \nIn the mid-19th century, the European powers were expanding their control over the rest of the world and preparing the ground for increasingly bloody wars. They stoked nationalist prejudice and fostered racism to justify their actions. The Manifesto took these ideas head on: \n \nIn proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another is put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\n \n In the coming years, Marx and Engels sharpened their critique of national oppression. In Capital , Marx explained how capitalism\'s most cherished myth, "the free market," was really based on slavery, colonialism and the naked robbery of the wealth of Africa, Asia and Latin America. The market was only "free" from the point of view of the capitalists and slave masters. \n Today, the American government is whipping up an anti-Arab and Muslim racism to justify occupying two countries, the politicians scapegoat Latino and Asian immigrants for layoffs and budget cuts, and the descendents of the millions of slaves who built up America\'s wealth suffer imprisonment at rates many times greater than that of whites. \n The Rich Get Richer...and Meaner \nThe Internet and instant cable news have made the world a very small place, and we take for granted the power of monster global corporations. In Marx and Engel\'s day, capitalism was just taking root, but they could see where the system was going. As they put it in this prophetic passage in the Manifesto : \n \nThe bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production...All fixed, fast-frozen relations...are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned...The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.\n \n Marx and Engels saw that aspects of this rapid industrial and technological progress were positive, but warned that ordinary people in society would pay a heavy price: \n \nOwing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine...In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases.\n \n That certainly describes most people\'s jobs today. Whether you work for $9 an hour at Starbucks or $22 an hour in an auto plant or $30 an hour as a nurse, you know that the biggest part of any technological innovation goes to the boss. \n No matter how much the economy grows, there\'s never enough money for health care, education or decent wages. Of course, they always find a way to pay for war and tax cuts for the rich. And this is all in "good times"--we all know what happens when capitalism goes into to one of its regular slumps. \n - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n NOW YOU see why I\'m going to win the bet. But Marx and Engel\'s eloquent denunciations of capitalism\'s crimes are not the most important part of the Manifesto . \n Like the song says, "You don\'t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows." However, you do need a meteorologist to tell you when a storm is coming, what conditions make create that storm, and what you should do to prepare for it. \n What Ben Franklin did for thunderstorms, Marx and Engels did for economics and politics. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels provided an overall theory to help explain history, how to fight for justice today, and the possibility of a better future. \n Liberal and conservative historians want you to believe that society has always been divided between the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, men and women, etc.--division based on money, race, nationality is built into our human nature. \n The Manifesto takes a radically different view: Humans lived for thousands of years in what Marx and Engels called "primitive communism"--by which they meant societies that existed in every part of the world where cooperation and mutual reliance, and not competition, formed the basis of survival. \n At the time, this was based on cutting-edge anthropological research that was very controversial, but today, all but a few right-wing cranks accept that this is the truth about pre-class human society. \n This is more than just an interesting observation. Marx and Engels based their whole view of the possibility of social change on it. If humans lived for tens of thousands of years without war and cutthroat competition, then we can do it again. Simple, huh? \n Many famous people have agreed with this as a hope or a wish or a dream--Jesus, Buddha, Mohammad, Moses, Spartacus, Ghandi and Martin Luther King to name a few. \n However, Marx and Engels make a very specific case about how to make this vision of a different kind of world concrete: \n \nThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf... in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.\n \n So once primitive communism is replaced by the haves and have-nots, two things happen: The rich fight like hell to get richer, while the poor resist their exploitation to the best of their ability. \n Human history is about our capacity as a species to innovate, and then about the fight over who will benefit from our collective efforts--everyone equally or a domineering minority. \n The rich usually manage to keep control because they can pay other people to carry arms to enforce their will, and they have the leisure time to dedicate to politics. But any given ruling class always has to watch out for a challenge from two sources: either foreign competitors abroad and newly emerging wealthy classes at home, or the solidarity of the lower classes banding together to try to upend the status quo. \n It is very common in history for one ruling class to be replaced by another: the Greeks beat the Persians, the Romans beat the Germans, the Chinese beat the Vietnamese, the Moguls beat the Hindus, the Aztecs beat the Tepanecs. More recently, European and American imperialism has seized control of most parts of the world. Many mainstream historians choose their favorite conquering nation, and then write history based on defending that conquest. \n Marx and Engels certainly recognized that this happened, but they were interested in a different fight: namely, could the oppressed people in any given country work together to get rid of their rulers and get back to running society cooperatively, like primitive communism, but with better technology? And if they could, was it possible to spread that revolution internationally? \n Their affirmative answer is as radical today as it was back then. Contrary to myth, the Communist Manifesto never said that socialism was inevitable. In fact, Marx and Engels pointed out that the "common ruin of the contending classes" was very common in history and a real danger. \n Today, we have to ask ourselves what will happen to the planet if we cannot successfully challenge the power of the imperialists and the corporations. Every year, 6 million children die from malnourishment and lack of cheap medicines. Wars are killing millions more, and, sooner or later, some president or premier will decide that nuclear warfare is "reasonable." Global warming endangers thousands of species, and the drinking water and farmland upon which hundreds of millions of people rely. \n The disasters that modern capitalism has in store for us make the collapse of Rome look like a picnic. But socialism, a society based on democratic planning of the economy in order to eradicate poverty and oppression, is not a pipe dream. It is one of our possible futures. \n Of course, Marx and Engels--and countless millions of working-class socialist activists--fought and died without achieving their goals. And today, they seem even farther away. \n Marx and Engels would be the last people to tell you that simply reading the Communist Manifesto would change the world.

It upheld the legacy of Joseph Stalin and accused the post-Stalin Soviet leadership of deviating from the socialist path. It represented the line taken by the People\'s Republic of China and People\'s Republic of Albania after the Sino-Soviet Split . Little is known about the group.

It was moreover claimed that the document had been distributed clandestinely amongst communists in the Soviet Union. [ 2 ] The document harshly criticized the wealthy lifestyles of the upper sections of the Soviet bureaucracy, argued that such lifestyles were in contradiction to socialism. [ 3 ] \n The first known English-language edition of the document was released in Albania at this point. In the beginning of 1967 a French language translation was published through French and Belgian leftwing publications. [ 2 ] In the same year a Swedish language edition was published by KFML , with a preface by Nils Holmberg . [ 4 ] \n [ edit ] An Albanian hoax? \n Since the only information about the group comes from contemporary official Albanian sources, there has been speculation about whether the group actually existed or was simply a fictional construct of the Albanian Party. [ 5 ] In any case, the existence of \'Revolutionary Communists\' within the Soviet Union was used in the Albanian rhetoric to claim legitimacy for their position within the international communist movement, i.e. that they represented the original Bolshevik line of Lenin and Stalin. [ 6 ] \n [ edit ] Involvement of Molotov? \n At the time the programme document began circulating in Western Europe, a general assumption amongst its Western distributors was that the group had been formed around the former Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, V.M. Molotov . This assumption was based on a study of the language used in the text and direct references to Molotov and his associates in inner party struggles. Molotov had been expelled from the CPSU after the takeover by Khrushchev.

Khrushchev\'s betrayal the time has come for you Soviet communists to perform your lofty revolutionary duty towards your glorious party, people and country, towards the proletariat and peoples of the whole world, not to allow the treacherous Khrushchevite clique to jeopardize the future of socialism and communism. The Soviet revolutionary communists have never sat back on the strength of their traditions and merits of the past. Today more than ever before these traditions should be reasserted in the same revolutionary spirit, with the same determination and devotion to principle, to defend the glorious name of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to raise high its revolutionary banner, flung to the ground by N. Khrushchev."

Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga , Herman Gorter , Anton Pannekoek , Otto R\xc3\xbchle , Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick . \n Left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party , the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Early history and overview \n 2 Russian left communism \n 3 Italian left communism until 1926 \n 4 German-Dutch left communism until 1933 \n 5 Left communism and the Communist International \n 6 Italian left communism 1926\xe2\x80\x931939 \n 7 1939\xe2\x80\x931945 \n 8 1945\xe2\x80\x931952 \n 9 1952\xe2\x80\x931968 \n 10 Since 1968 \n 11 See also \n 12 References \n 13 Further reading \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Early history and overview \n Two major traditions can be observed within left communism: the Dutch-German tradition and the Italian tradition . [ 1 ] The political positions those traditions have in common are a shared opposition to what is termed frontism , many kinds of nationalism and thus national liberation movements (although, it must be stressed that Bordiga and many Bordigist groups have positions that some left-communists consider supportive of national liberation) and parliamentarianism . There is an underlying commonality at a level of abstract theory and more crucially, left communist groups from both traditions tend to identify elements of commonality in each other. \n The historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before the First World War , but it only came into focus after 1918 . All left communists were supportive of the October Revolution in Russia but retained a critical view of its development. Some, however, would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a proletarian or socialist nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution by creating a state capitalist system. \n Left communism first came into being as a clear movement in or around 1918. Its essential features were: a stress on the need to build a communist party entirely separate from the reformist and centrist elements who were seen as having betrayed socialism in 1914, opposition to all but the most restricted participation in elections and an emphasis on the need for revolutionaries to move on the offensive. Apart from that, there was little in common between the various wings. Only the Italians accepted the need for electoral work at all for a very short period of time, which they later vehemently opposed, attracting the wrath of Lenin attacking Bordiga in "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder [6] , the German-Dutch and Russian wings opposed the "right of nations to self-determination" which they denounced as a form of bourgeois nationalism , the Italians did not have a clear position on national determination however. \n [ edit ] Russian left communism \n Russian left communism began in 1918 as a faction within the Russian Communist Party named the Left Communists , which opposed the signing of the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty with Imperial Germany . The Left Communists wanted international proletarian revolution across the world . The leader of this faction, in the beginning, was Nikolai Bukharin . They stood for a revolutionary war against the Central Powers ; opposed the right of nations to self-determination (specifically in the case of Poland , since there were many Poles in this communist group and they did not want a Polish capitalist state to be established); and they generally took a voluntarist stance regarding the possibilities for social revolution at that time. \n They began to publish a newspaper, Kommunist [7] , which offered a critique of the direction in which the Bolsheviks were heading. They argued against the over-bureaucratisation of the state and further argued that full state ownership of the means of production should proceed at a quicker pace than Lenin desired. \n The Left Communists faded as the world revolutionary wave died down in militancy; Lenin had shifted to a more right-wing position and proved too strong a figure. They also lost Bukharin as a leading figure, since his position became more right-wing until he eventually came to agree with Lenin. Being defeated in internal debates, they then dissolved. A few very small left communist groups surfaced within the RSFSR in the next few years, but later fell victim to repression by the state. In many ways, the positions of the Left Communists were inherited by the Workers Opposition faction and Gabriel Myasnikov \'s Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party and to some extent by the Decists . \n [ edit ] Italian left communism until 1926 \n The Italian left communists were named "left communists" at a later stage in their development, but when the Communist Party of Italy (PCI) was founded, its members actually represented the majority of communists in that country. This was a result of the Abstentionist Communist Faction of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) being in advance of other sections of the PSI in their realisation that a separate communist party had to be formed which did not include reformists . This gave them a great advantage over the sections of the PSI who looked to figures such as Serratti and Gramsci for leadership. It was a consequence of the revolutionary impatience common at a time when revolution, in the narrow sense of an insurrectionary attempt at the seizure of power, was expected to develop in the very near future. \n Under the leadership of Amadeo Bordiga , the left was to control the PCI until the Lyons Congress of 1926. In this period, the militants of the PCI would find themselves isolated from reformist workers and from other anti-fascist militants. At one stage this isolation was deepened when communist militants were instructed to leave defense organisations that were not totally controlled by the party. These sectarian tactics produced concern in the leadership of the Communist International and led to a developing opposition within the PCI itself. Eventually these two factors led to the displacement of Bordiga from his position as first secretary and his replacement by Gramsci. By then, Bordiga was in a fascist jail and he was to remain outside organised politics until 1952. The development of the Left Communist Faction was not the development of the Bordigist current (as it is often portrayed). \n The year 1925 was a turning point for the Italian left as it was the year that the so-called Bolshevisation took place in the sections of the Communist International. This plan was designed to eliminate all social democratic deviations from the Comintern and develop them on Bolshevik lines or at least along the lines of what Zinoviev , the secretary of the International, considered Bolshevik lines. In practice, this meant top-down bureaucratic structures in which the members were controlled by a leadership approved of by the Comintern\'s International Executive Committee. In Italy this meant that the leadership which had formerly been in the hands of Bordiga was given to a body that came into being when the Serrati-Maffi minority of the PSI joined the PCI, although Bordiga\'s group were in a majority. The new leadership was supported by Bordiga, who, as a centralist, accepted the will of the International. \n Nevertheless, Bordiga fought the IEC from within, only to have an article of his which was favourable to Trotsky \'s positions on the disputed Russian questions suppressed. Meanwhile, sections of the left motivated by Onorato Damen formed the Entente Committee . This committee was ordered to dissolve itself by the incoming leadership, led now by Gramsci who only then opposed Bordiga\'s positions, which had gained prestige after a successful recruitment campaign. With the party Congress of 1926 held in Lyons, crowned by Gramsci\'s famous Lyons Theses , the left majority was now defeated and on course to becoming a minority within the party. With the victory of fascism in Italy, Bordiga was jailed and when he opposed a vote against Trotsky in the prison PCI group, he was expelled from the party in 1930 . He took a stance of non-involvement in politics for many years after this. The victory of Italian fascism also meant that the Italian left would enter into a new chapter in its development - this time in exile. \n [ edit ] German-Dutch left communism until 1933 \n The German-Dutch tradition of left communism was so named because the movement in both countries was very closely connected. Among the leading theoreticians of the more powerful German movement were Anton Pannekoek and Herman Gorter (for example) and German activists found refuge in the Netherlands after the Nazis came to power in 1933. This current could trace its origins back before World War I , since in the Netherlands a revolutionary wing of Social Democracy had broken from the reformist party even before the war and had built links with German activists. After the beginning of the German Revolution in 1918, a leftist mood could be found among sections of the communist parties of both countries. In Germany this led directly to the foundation of the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD) after its leading figures were expelled from the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) by Paul Levi . This development was mirrored in the Netherlands and on a smaller scale in Bulgaria , where the left communist movement was to mimic that of Germany. \n When it was founded, the KAPD included some tens of thousands of revolutionaries. However, within a few years, it had broken up and practically dissolved. This was because it was founded on the basis of revolutionary optimism and a purism that rejected what became known as frontism. Frontism entailed working in the same organisations as reformist workers. Such work was seen by the KAPD as unhelpful at a time when the revolution was thought to be an imminent event, and not merely a goal to be aimed at. This led the members of the KAPD to reject working in the traditional trade unions in favour of forming their own Revolutionary Unions . These unionen , so called to distinguish them from the official trade unions, had 80,000 members in 1920 and peaked in 1921 with 200,000 members, after which they declined rapidly. They were also organisationally divided from the beginning, with those unionen linked to the KAPD forming the AAU-D, and those in Saxony around Otto R\xc3\xbchle who opposed the conception of a party in favour of a unitary class organisation being organised as the AAU-E. \n The KAPD was unable to reach even its founding Congress prior to suffering its first split when the so-called National Bolshevik tendency around Fritz Wolffheim and Heinrich Laufenberg appeared (it should be noted that this tendency has no connection with modern political tendencies in Russia which use the same name). More seriously, the KAPD lost most of its support very rapidly as it failed to develop lasting structures. This also contributed to internecine quarrels and the party actually split into two competing tendencies known as the Essen and Berlin tendencies to the historians of the left. The recently established Communist Workers International (KAI) split on exactly the same lines as did the tiny Communist Workers Party of Bulgaria . The only other affiliates of the KAI were the Communist Workers Party of Britain led by Sylvia Pankhurst , the Communist Workers Party of the Netherlands (KAPN) in the Netherlands and a group in Russia. The AAU-D split on the same lines, and it rapidly ceased to exist as a real tendency within the factories. \n [ edit ] Left communism and the Communist International \n As discussed above, the left communists initially rallied to the Russian Revolution of October 1917 and to the new Communist International. In fact, they controlled the first body formed by the Comintern to coordinate its activities in Western Europe , the Amsterdam Bureau . However, this was little more than a very brief interlude and the Bureau never functioned as a leadership body for Western Europe as was originally intended. The Vienna Bureau of the Comintern may also be classified as left communist, but its personnel were not to evolve into either of the two historic currents that made up left communism. Rather, the Vienna Bureau adopted the ultra-left ideas of the earliest period in the history of the Comintern. \n Left communists supported the Russian Revolution, but did not accept the methods of the Bolsheviks. Many of the German-Dutch tradition adopted Rosa Luxembourg \'s criticisms, as outlined in her posthumously published essay entitled " Marxism or Leninism? ". In this essay, she rejected the Bolshevik position on distribution of land to the peasantry, and their espousal of the "Right of nations to Self Determination" which she rejected as historically outmoded. The Italian left communists did not at the time accept any of these criticisms and both currents would evolve. \n To a considerable degree, Lenin\'s well known polemic Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder [8] is an attack on the ideas of the emerging left communist currents. His main aim was to polemicise with currents moving towards pure revolutionary tactics by showing them that they could remain based on firmly revolutionary principles while utilising a variety of tactics. Therefore Lenin defended the use of parliamentarism and working within the official trade unions. \n As the Kronstadt rebellion occurred at a time when the debate on tactics was still raging within the Comintern, it has been wrongly seen as being left communist by some commentators. In fact, the left communist currents had no connection with the rebellion - although they did rally to its support when they learned of it. In later years, the German-Dutch tradition in particular would come to see the suppression of the revolt as the historic turning point in the evolution of the Russian state after October 1917. \n [ edit ] Italian left communism 1926\xe2\x80\x931939 \n After 1926, Italian left communism took shape in exile and without the participation of Bordiga. Contacts between the Italians and the Germans had been made and were developed in France, but the Italian left saw the KAPD\'s stress on factory organisation as being similar to the ideas of Gramsci\'s L\'Ordine Nuovo and therefore rejected closer contact. Attempts to work with the group around Karl Korsch also failed. The left faction of the PCd\'I was formally established in July 1927 by a number of young militants. This new group had members in France, Belgium and the USA and published a review entitled Prometeo . It was estimated in 1928 that it had at most 200 militants, but it would seem that while it never had more than 100 militants active at any one time its influence was actually far greater. The control of the PCd\'I apparatus by the Stalinists , however, meant that attempts to reach other exiles was almost impossible and they were driven back into small circle work. \n The Italian left faction was for the rest of the 1930s led by Ottorino Perrone (also known with the pseudonym Vercesi), although it was fiercely opposed to the cult of the personality which was developing in the Comintern around Stalin in these years and resisted similar pressures in its own organisation. The faction had members in France, Belgium and the USA; how many in Italy looked to it cannot be ascertained (since all communist activities there had been driven underground by the fascist government). The main activity of the faction through these years was the publishing of its press, which consisted of the paper Prometeo and the journal Bilan . With its establishment as a group, the Fraction also looked for international co-thinkers. Seeing the International Left Opposition , led by Leon Trotsky , as central to the non-Stalinist Communist movement, they sought contact with it. These contacts were to be severed when agreement on basic principles proved impossible. \n The political distance between the faction and other communist currents would deepen throughout the 1930s as the faction declared itself opposed to the tactics adopted by the Left Opposition to broaden its support (i.e. the faction affirmed its opposition to fusion with centrist groups, opposition to entryism , etc.) Always opposed to the United Front tactic of the Comintern, the Fraction now declared itself firmly opposed to the Popular Front after 1933 . Like the Trotskyists , it saw the failure of the Communist Party of Germany in the face of fascism as its historic failure and ceased to consider itself a fraction of the Communist Party from the date of its 1935 Congress, held in Brussels . \n Isolated, the Left Fraction sought to discover allies within the milieu of groups to the left of the Trotskyist movement. Typically these discussions came to nothing, but they were able to recruit from the disintegrating Ligue des Communistes Internationalistes (LCI) in Belgium , a group which had broken from Trotskyism. A loose liaison was also maintained with the Council Communist groups in the Netherlands and in particular with the GIK. However, these discussions were pushed into the background as the attempted fascist coup in Spain led to revolution and civil war . \n Immediately after the civil war began, a minority emerged within the Left Fraction whose members sought to participate in the events in Spain. This minority, including longtime members of the fraction, numbered some 26 militants mainly belonging to the Parisian federation of the Fraction. They traveled to Barcelona to enlist in the workers militias and after a fruitless meeting in September with a delegation from the Fraction back home, they were expelled. The problem for the Fraction was that the military support given to the Republican forces by this minority was accompanied by political support (in that the minority wished to halt strikes among loyalist workers in the name of military victory against fascism). According to the Fraction, no support could be given to a bourgeois state , even in a struggle against fascism. \n The question of Spain forced the Belgian LCI to clarify its positions and a split ensued as a result of debate within its ranks. At its February 1937 conference a minority of the LCI led by Mitchell defended the positions of the Italian Left and were expelled. Although less than ten in number, they formed a Belgian Fraction of the Communist Left . It was at this point that the Italian Left learned of a group called the Grupo de Trabajadores in Mexico with very similar positions to their own. It was led by Paul Kirchhoff and had left the Mexican Trotskyist movement. Kirchoff had formerly been a member of the KAPD in Germany, then a Trotskyist in the USA but his tiny group would seem to have disappeared at the outbreak of war in 1939. In early 1938 the Italian and Belgian Fractions formed an International Bureau of the Left Fractions which published a review called Octobre . \n During this period the Italian Left also reviewed a number of positions which it thought had become outdated. They rejected the idea of national self-determination and began to develop their views on the war economy and capitalist decadence . Much of this was carried out by Vercesi, but Mitchell from the Belgian Fraction was also a leading figure in the work. Perhaps most dramatically they also reviewed their understanding of the Russian Revolution and the state that had emerged from it. Eventually they came to argue that the Russian state was by the late 1930s state capitalist and was not to be defended. In short, they believed there was need for a new revolution. \n [ edit ] 1939\xe2\x80\x931945 \n Many small currents to the left of the mass Communist Parties collapsed at the beginning of the Second World War and the Left Communists were initially silent too. Despite having foreseen the war more clearly than some other factions, when it began they were overwhelmed. Many were persecuted by either German Nazism or Italian fascism. Leading militants of the Communist Left, such as Mitchell, who was Jewish, were to die in the Buchenwald concentration camp. \n Meanwhile, in Germany the final council communist groups had disappeared in the maelstrom and in the Netherlands the International Communist Group (GIK) was moribund. The former " centrist " group led by Henk Sneevliet (the Revolutionary Socialist Workers Party, RSAP ) transformed itself into the Marx-Lenin-Luxemburg Front . But in April 1942 its leadership was arrested by the Gestapo and killed. The remaining activists then split into two camps, on the one hand some turned to Trotskyism forming the Committee of Revolutionary Marxists (CRM) while the majority formed the CommunistenBond-Spartacus . The latter group turned to council communism and was joined by most members of the GIK. \n In 1941, the Italian Fraction was reorganised in France and along with the new French Nucleus of the Communist Left came into conflict with the ideas which the Fraction had propagated from 1936: of the social disappearance of the proletariat and localised wars, etc. These ideas continued to be defended by Vercesi in Brussels. Gradually the Left Fractions adopted positions drawn from German Left Communism. They abandoned the conception that the Russian state remained in some way proletarian and also dropped Vercesi\'s conception of localised wars in favour of ideas on imperialism inspired by Rosa Luxemburg. Vercesi\'s participation in a Red Cross committee was also fiercely contested. \n The strike at FIAT in October 1942 had a major impact on the Italian Fraction in France, which was deepened by the fall of Mussolini\'s regime in July 1943. The Italian Fraction now saw a pre-revolutionary situation opening in Italy and prepared to participate in the coming revolution. Revived by Marco in Marseilles, the Italian Fraction now worked closely with the new French Fraction, which was formally founded in Paris in December 1944. However in May 1945 the Italian Fraction, many of whose members had already returned to Italy, voted to dissolve itself so that it\'s militants could integrate themselves as individuals into the Internationalist Communist Party . The conference at which this decision was made also refused to recognise the French Fraction and expelled Marco from their group. \n This led to a split in the French Fraction and the formation of the Gauche Communiste de France by the French Fraction led by Marco. The history of the GCF belongs to the post-war period. Meanwhile the former members of the French Fraction who sympathised with Vercesi and the Internationalist Communist party formed a new French Fraction, which published the journal L\'Etincelle and was joined at the end of 1945 by the old minority of the Fraction who had joined L\'Union Communiste in the 1930s. \n One other development during the war years merits mention at this point. A small grouping of German and Austrian militants came close to Left Communist positions in these years. Best known, to those few who know of them, as the Revolutionary Communist Organisation , these young militants were exiles from Nazism living in France at the start of World War II and were members of the Trotskyist movement but they had opposed the formation of the Fourth International in 1938 on the grounds that it was premature. They were refused full delegates\' credentials and only admitted to the founding conference of the Youth International on the following day. They then joined Hugo Oehler \'s International Contact Commission for the Fourth (Communist) International and in 1939 were publishing Der Marxist in Antwerp . \n With the beginning of the war, they took the name Revolutionary Communists of Germany (RKD) and came to define Russia as state capitalist, in agreement with Ante Ciliga\'s book The Russian Enigma . At this point they adopted a revolutionary defeatist position on the war and condemned Trotskyism for its critical defence of Russia (which was seen by Trotskyists as a degenerated workers\' state ). After the fall of France, they renewed contact with militants in the Trotskyist milieu in Southern France and recruited some of them into the Communistes Revolutionnaires in 1942. This group became known as Fraternisation Proletarienne in 1943 and then L\'Organisation Communiste Revolutionnaire in 1944 . The CR and RKD were autonomous, and clandestine, but worked closely together with shared politics. As the war ran its course, they evolved in a councilist direction, while also identifying more and more with Rosa Luxemburg\'s work. They also worked with the French Fraction of the Communist Left and seem to have disintegrated at the end of the war. This disintegration was speeded no doubt by the capture of a leading militant, Karl Fischer , who was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he was to participate in writing the Declaration of the Internationalist Communists of Buchenwald when the camp was liberated. \n [ edit ] 1945\xe2\x80\x931952 \n The closing stages of the Second World War marked a watershed in the history of Left Communism, as was true for every other political tendency. Left Communists, like the Trotskyists, expected the war to end with at least the beginnings of a revolutionary wave of struggle similar to that which had marked the end of the First World War. Therefore strikes in Italy from 1942 onwards were of intense interest to them. Many Left Communists formerly in exile, in jail or simply inactive due to repression returned to active political activity in Italy. This had the result that new organisations identifying with Left Communism came into being and older ones dissolved themselves. We look at these organisations and in particular at the International Communist Party below. \n If for the Italian Left the end of war marked a new beginning, it also did so for the German-Dutch Left. Although in Germany it was the case that the Communist Left tradition was all but extinguished, surviving only in the form of a few scattered groups holding councilist views, France, by comparison, saw an interesting development with the beginning of a conscious attempt to develop a synthesis of the two strands of Left Communism in the form of the Gauche Communiste de France , which built on pre-war contributions. \n [ edit ] 1952\xe2\x80\x931968 \n The year 1952 signaled the end of mass influence on the part of Italian Left Communism, as its sole remaining representative, the Internationalist Communist Party, split in two sections; the group led by Bordiga took the name International Communist Party , which continues today. The Gauche Communiste de France (GCF) also dissolved in the same year. Left Communists entered a period of almost constant decline from this point onwards, although they were somewhat rejuvenated by the events of 1968 . \n [ edit ] Since 1968 \n The uprisings of May 1968 led to a small resurgence of interest in left communist ideas. Various small left communist groups emerged around the world, predominantly in the leading capitalist countries. [ citation needed ] A series of conferences of the communist left began in 1976, with the aim of promoting international and cross-tendency discussion, but these petered out in the 1980s without having increased the profile of the movement or its unity of ideas. [ 2 ] \n Prominent post-1968 proponents of Left Communism have included Paul Mattick and Maximilien Rubel . Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party , International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency . In addition to the left communist groups in the direct lineage of the Italian and Dutch traditions, a number of groups with similar positions have flourished since 1968, such as the workerist and autonomist movements in Italy; Kolinko, Kurasje, Wildcat [ 3 ] and Krisis in Germany; Subversion and Aufheben in England; Th\xc3\xa9orie Communiste and Echanges &amp; Mouvements in France; TPTG, [ 4 ] Blaumachen [ 5 ] in Greece; Kamunist Kranti in India; Collective Action Notes and Loren Goldner in the USA. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Anarchist communism \n Autonomism \n Council communism \n Left Communism in China \n Libertarian socialism \n List of left communist internationals \n List of left communists \n Luxemburgism \n Ultra-leftism \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  [1] \n ^  [2] \n ^  [3] \n ^  [4] \n ^  [5] \n \n \n [ edit ] Further reading \n \n Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils (includes texts by Gorter , Pannekoek , Pankhurst and R\xc3\xbchle ), Red and Black Publishers, St Petersburg, Florida, 2007.

It was founded in 1864 in a workmen\'s meeting held in Saint Martin\'s Hall, London. Its first congress was held in 1866 in Geneva . \n In Europe, a period of harsh reaction followed the widespread Revolutions of 1848 . The next major phase of revolutionary activity began almost twenty years later with the founding of the IWA in 1864. At its peak, the IWA had 5 million members according to the police reports, [ 2 ] although the official journal reported 8 million members.

Henri Tolain , Perrachon, and Limousin visited London in July 1863, attending a meeting held in St. James\xe2\x80\x99 Hall in honour of the Polish uprising. Here there was discussion of the need for an international organisation, which would, amongst other things, prevent the import of foreign workers to break strikes. In September, 1864, some French delegates again visited London with the concrete aim of setting up a special committee for the exchange of information upon matters of interest to the workers of all lands. \n St. Martin\'s Hall Meeting, London, 1864 \n \n \n \n  \n Karl Marx (1818\xe2\x80\x931883). \n \n \n On September 28, a great international meeting for the reception of the French delegates took place in St. Martin\xe2\x80\x99s Hall in London. The meeting was attended by a wide array of European radicals, including English Owenites , French followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Louis Auguste Blanqui , Irish and Polish nationalists, Italian republicans, and German socialists. [ 4 ] Included among the last-mentioned of this eclectic band was a somewhat obscure 46-year old \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 journalist, Karl Marx , who would soon come to play a decisive role in the organisation. [ 4 ] \n The positivist historian Edward Spencer Beesly , a professor at London University , was in the chair. [ 4 ] His speech pilloried the violent proceedings of the governments and referred to their flagrant breaches of international law and advocated a union of the workers of the world for the realisation of justice on earth. George Odger , Secretary of the London Trades Council , read a speech calling for international co-operation. \n The meeting unanimously decided to found an international organisation of workers. The centre was to be in London, directed by a committee of 21, which was instructed to draft a programme and constitution. Most of the British members of the committee were drawn from the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes [ 5 ] and were noted trade-union leaders like Odger, George Howell (former secretary of the London Trades Council (LTC) which itself declined affiliation to the IWA (although remaining close to it)), Osborne, and Lucraft and included Owenites and Chartists . The French members were Denoual, Victor Le Lubez , and Bosquet. Italy was represented by Fontana. Other members were: Louis Wolff , Johann Eccarius , and at the foot of the list, Karl Marx . Marx participated in his individual capacity, and did not speak during the meeting. [ 6 ] \n This executive committee in turn selected a subcommittee to do the actual writing of the organisational programme \xe2\x80\x94 a group which included Karl Marx and which met at his home about a week after the conclusion of the St. Martin\'s Hall assembly. [ 4 ] This subcommittee deferred the task of collective writing in favor of sole authorship by Marx, and it was he who ultimately drew up the fundamental documents of the new organisation. [ 4 ] \n On October 5, the General Council was formed with co-opted additional members representing other nationalities. It was based at the headquarters of the Universal League for the Material Elevation of the Industrious Classes at 18 Greek Street. [ 7 ] Different groups offered proposals for the organisation: Louis Wolff ( Mazzini \'s secretary) offered a proposal based on the rules and constitution of the Italian Workingmen\xe2\x80\x99s Association (a Mazzinist organisation) and John Weston , [ disambiguation needed ] an Owenite, also tabled a programme. Wolff left for Italy, and Lubez rewrote it in a way which appalled Marx. Through deft manipulation of the sub-committee Marx was left with all the papers, and set about writing the Address to the Working Classes to which was attached a simplified set of rules. \n At its founding, the International Workingmen\'s Association was an alliance of people from diverse groups, including French Mutualists , Blanquists , English Owenites, Italian republicans , such American proponents of individualist anarchism as Stephen Pearl Andrews and William B. Greene , followers of Mazzini , and other socialists of various persuasions. Over its short life it grew into a major movement, with local federations in many countries developing strong bases of working class activism . Karl Marx was a constant, and leading, figure from the start\xe2\x80\x94he was elected to every succeeding General Council of the association. \n \n \n \n  \n Mikhail Bakunin . \n \n \n Due to the wide variety of philosophies present in the First International, there was conflict from the start. The first objections to Marx\'s influence came from the Mutualists who opposed communism and statism . However, shortly after Mikhail Bakunin and his followers (called Collectivists while in the International) joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Perhaps the clearest differences between the groups emerged over their proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The anarchists grouped around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin \'s words) "direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation." Marxist thinking, at that time, focused on parliamentary activity. For example, when the new German Empire of 1871 introduced male suffrage , many German socialists became active in the Marxist Social Democratic Party of Germany . \n The Geneva Congress, 1866 \n During the Geneva Congress the Paris group of Proudhonians dominated the discussions. Six Blanquists from Paris came to the Congress to denounce the French representatives as emissaries of Bonaparte, but they were thrown out. A significant decision at this event was the adoption of the 8-hour work day as one of the Association\'s fundamental demands. \n The Lausanne Congress, 1867 \n The Lausanne Congress of the International was held on September 2\xe2\x80\x938, 1867. Marx was unable to attend, as he was working on the final proofs of Das Kapital . The Congress was attended by 64 delegates from Great Britain , France , Germany , Belgium , Italy and Switzerland . The reports delivered recorded the increased influence of the International on the working classes in various countries. The Proudhonist delegates, primarily from France, influenced the orientation of the International\xe2\x80\x99s activity and its programmatic principles. Despite the efforts of the General Council\xe2\x80\x99s delegates, they succeeded in revising the resolutions of the Geneva Congress, passing a number of their resolutions, in particular on cooperation and credit . \n However, the Congress confirmed the Geneva Congress resolutions on the economic struggle and strikes and passed a resolution on political freedom which emphasised that the social emancipation of workers was inseparable from political liberation. The Proudhonists also failed to seize the leadership of the International, as the Congress re-elected the General Council in its former composition and retained London as its seat. \n However, the Lausanne Congress ignored the General Council\xe2\x80\x99s resolution and resolved officially to take part in the Congress of the League of Peace and Freedom . However, this Congress was attended by several General Council and some other International members and failed to resolve its political differences. \n The Brussels Congress, 1868 \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Socialism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Development \n \n \n \n History of socialism \n Socialist economics \n Socialist calculation debate \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ideas \n \n \n \n Calculation in kind \n Cooperative \n Common ownership \n Economic democracy \n Economic planning \n Equal opportunity \n Free association \n Labour voucher \n Material balancing \n Peer-to-Peer economy \n Production for use \n Public ownership \n Self-management \n Social dividend \n Socialization \n \n To each according \nto his contribution \n \n Workplace democracy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Models \n \n \n \n \n Decentralized planning \n Participatory economics \n \n \n Market socialism \n \n \n \n Lange model \n Mutualism \n \n \n \n Economic democracy \n \n \n Planned economy \n Soviet-type \n Project Cybersyn \n \n \n Socialist market economy \n Socialist-oriented market \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Variants \n \n \n \n Agrarian \n Anarchist \n \n \n Democratic \n Ethical \n \n \n Ecological \n Guild \n \n \n Impossibilism \n Liberal \n \n \n Libertarian \n Market \n Marxian \n \n \n One country \n Owenism \n \n \n Reformism \n Religious \n \n \n Revisionism \n Revolutionary \n \n \n Ricardian \n Scientific \n \n \n Social democracy \n State \n \n \n Syndicalism \n Utopian \n \n \n Zionist \n 21st-century \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Charles Hall \n Henri de Saint-Simon \n \n \n Robert Owen \n Charles Fourier \n \n \n William Thompson \n Thomas Hodgskin \n \n \n Louis Blanc \n Moses Hess \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Friedrich Engels \n \n \n Ferdinand Lassalle \n William Morris \n \n \n Mary Harris Jones \n Eugene V.

According to G. M. Stekloff \'s account, [ 8 ] in attendance were: \n \n Seventy-five delegates assembled: from Great Britain, the 6 members of the General Council, Applegarth, Eccarius , Cowell Stepney, Lessner, Lucraft, and Jung; from France, which sent 26 delegates, among whom we may mention Dereure, Landrin, Ch\xc3\xa9mal\xc3\xa9, Murat, Aubry, Tolain, A. Richard, Palix, Varlin, and Bakunin : Belgium sent 5 delegates, among whom were Hins, Brism\xc3\xa9e, and De Paepe ; Austria 2 delegates, Neumayer and Oberwinder; Germany sent 10 delegates, among whom were Becker, Liebknecht , Rittinghausen, and Hess; Switzerland had 22 representatives, among whom were Burkly, Greulich, Fritz Robert, Guillaume , Schwitzgu\xc3\xa9bel , and Perret; Italy sent but one delegate, Caporusso; from Spain there came Farga-Pellicer and Sentinon; and the United States of America was represented by Cameron. Jung was elected chairman of the congress. \n \n The conference was mainly noted for the confrontation between the Proudhonist mutualists and the collectivist position, defended by Marx\'s envoy for the General Council and Bakunin both. But the Belgian socialist de Paepe played a decisive role in bringing the Belgian delegation across to the collectivist side and isolating the mainly French Proudhonists. \n The Hague Congress, 1872 \n Main article: Hague Congress (1872) \n After the Paris Commune (1871), Bakunin characterised Marx\'s ideas as authoritarian , and argued that if a Marxist party came to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against (notably in his Statism and Anarchy ). In 1872, the conflict in the First International climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress. This clash is often cited as the origin of the long-running conflict between anarchists and Marxists . From then on, the Marxist and anarchist currents of socialism had distinct organisations, at various points including rival " internationals ". \n This split is sometimes called the "red" and "black" divide, red referring to the Marxists and black referring to the anarchists. Otto von Bismarck remarked, upon hearing of the split at the First International, "Crowned heads, wealth and privilege may well tremble should ever again the Black and Red unite!" [ 9 ] \n The Hague Congress was notable for the expulsion of Bakunin and Guillaume and for the decision to relocate the General Council to New York City . \n After 1872 \n The sixth Congress of the International was held in Geneva in September 1873, but was generally considered to be a failure. The International disbanded three years later, at the 1876 Philadelphia conference. Attempts to revive the organization over the next five years failed. However, the Second International was established in 1889 as its successor. Meanwhile, the anarchists continued to consider that they were unfairly ejected from the IWA, and in 1872 held a new congress at Saint-Imier over two days, September 15 and 16, 1872, where they declared themselves to be the true heirs of the International (see Anarchist St. Imier International ). Later, after the anarchist International collapsed in 1877, a year after the remnants of the rival Marxist group, there was an attempt to refound an anarchist International in 1881, with the International Working People\'s Association . This so-called "Black International" gradually passed out of existence after the late 1880s, until the anarcho-syndicalists decided to re-found the "First International" in a congress held at Berlin in 1922 as the International Workers Association . The IWA still exists. \n See also \n \n \n \n  \n Organized labour portal \n \n \n  \n Anarchism portal \n \n \n \n \n Second International and Socialist International \n Third International (Comintern) \n Fourth International and Trotskyist internationals \n Fifth International \n International Working People\'s Association \n International Workers Association \n International Anarchist Congresses \n List of left-wing internationals \n The Internationale \n George Odger , radical British trade unionist and reformer, President of the International. \n Victor Consid\xc3\xa9rant , a utopian socialist and member of the International. \n Alfred Walton , radical British reformer and member of the International. \n \n Footnotes \n \n \n ^  "Dictionary of politics: selected American and foreign political and legal terms" .

The economy was characterised by state control of investment, public ownership of industrial assets, and during the last 20 years of its existence, pervasive corruption and socioeconomic stagnation. \n After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, continuing economic liberalisation moved the economy towards a market-oriented socialist economy . All of these factors contributed to the final dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The stagnation that would consume the last years of the Soviet Union was caused by poor governance under Leonid Brezhnev and inefficiencies within the planned economy . When the stagnation began is a matter of debate, but is normally placed either in the 1960s or early 1970s. \n Beginning in 1928, the entire course of the economy was guided by a series of Five-Year Plans . By the 1950s, the Soviet Union had, during the preceding few decades, evolved from a mainly agrarian society into a major industrial power. [ 14 ] Its transformative capacity\xe2\x80\x94what the United States National Security Council described as a "proven ability to carry backward countries speedily through the crisis of modernization and industrialization"\xe2\x80\x94meant communism consistently appealed to the intellectuals of developing countries in Asia. [ 15 ] Impressive growth rates during the first three Five-Year Plans (1928\xe2\x80\x9340) are particularly notable given that this period is nearly congruent with the Great Depression. [ 16 ] Nevertheless, the impoverished base upon which the Five-Year Plans sought to build meant that, at the commencement of Operation Barbarossa , the country was still poor. [ 17 ] While legitimate strictly in terms of growth and industrialisation, the death toll attributable to Stalinist economic development has been estimated at 10 million, much of which comprises famine victims . [ 18 ] \n The complex demands of the modern economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central planners. Corruption and data fiddling became common practice among the bureaucracy by reporting fulfilled targets and quotas, thus entrenching the crisis. Nonetheless, from the Stalin-era to the early Brezhnev-era, the Soviet economy grew much slower than Japan and slightly faster than the U.S. GDP levels in 1950 (in billion 1990 dollars) were 510 (100%) in the USSR, 161 (100%) in Japan and 1456 (100%) in the US. By 1965 the corresponding values were 1011 (198%), 587 (365%), and 2607 (179%). [ 19 ] \n The USSR\'s relatively small service sector accounted for just under 60% of the country\'s GDP in 1990, while the industrial and agricultural sectors contributed 21.9% and 20% respectively in 1991. Agriculture was the predominant occupation in the USSR before the massive industrialization under Joseph Stalin . The service sector was of low importance in the USSR, with the majority of the labor force employed in the industrial sector . The labor force totaled 152.3 million people.

Beginning in 1928, the economy was directed by a series of five-year plans , with a brief attempt at seven-year planning. For every enterprise, planning ministries (also known as the "fund holders" or fondoderzhateli ) defined the mix of economic inputs (e.g., labor and raw materials), a schedule for completion, all wholesale prices and almost all retail prices . The planning process was based around material balances - balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally-planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process [ citation needed ] . \n Industry was long concentrated after 1928 on the production of capital goods through metallurgy , machine manufacture, and chemical industry. In Soviet terminology, the capital goods were known as group A goods , or means of production . This emphasis was based on the perceived necessity for a very fast industrialization and modernization of the Soviet Union. After the death of Stalin in 1953, consumer goods ( group B goods ) received more emphasis [ citation needed ] . For further details see consumer goods in the Soviet Union . \n Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down. There were several mechanisms in place for producers and consumers to provide input and information that would help in the drafting of economic plans (as detailed below), but the political climate was such that few people ever provided negative input or criticism of the plan [ citation needed ] . Thus, Soviet planners had very little reliable feedback that they could use to determine the success of their plans. This meant that economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages ( defitsit , \xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd1\x84\xd0\xb8\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82), while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Low-level managers often did not report such problems to their superiors, relying instead on each other for support. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts without the knowledge of the authorities and outside the parameters of the economic plan [ citation needed ] . \n Heavy industry was always the focus of the Soviet economy, even in its later years. The fact that it received special attention from the planners, combined with the fact that industrial production was relatively easy to plan even without minute feedback, led to significant growth in that sector. The Soviet Union became one of the leading industrial nations of the world. Industrial production was disproportionately high in the Soviet Union compared to Western economies. However, the production of consumer goods was disproportionately low. Economic planners made little effort to determine the wishes of household consumers, resulting in severe shortages of many consumer goods. Whenever these consumer goods would become available on the market, consumers routinely had to stand in long lines (queues) to buy them. [ citation needed ] A black market developed for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced (such as cigarettes ). \n \n See also : Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning . \n \n [ edit ] Drafting the five-year plans \n Under Stalin \'s tutelage, a complex system of planning arrangements had developed since the introduction of the first five-year plan in 1928. Until the late-1980s and early-1990s, when economic reforms backed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced significant changes in the traditional system ( see Perestroika ), the allocation of resources was directed by a planning apparatus rather than through the interplay of market forces. \n [ edit ] Time frame \n From the Joseph Stalin era through the late 1980s, the five-year plan integrated short-range planning into a longer time frame. It delineated the chief thrust of the country\'s economic development and specified the way the economy could meet the desired goals of the Communist Party . Although the five-year plan was enacted into law, it contained a series of guidelines rather than a set of direct orders. \n Periods covered by the five-year plans coincided with those covered by the gatherings of the CPSU Party Congress . At each CPSU Congress, the party leadership presented the targets for the next five-year plan. Thus, each plan had the approval of the most authoritative body of the country\'s leading political institution. \n [ edit ] Guidelines for the plan \n The Central Committee of the CPSU and, more specifically, its Politburo , set basic guidelines for planning. The Politburo determined the general direction of the economy via control figures (preliminary plan targets), major investment projects (capacity creation), and general economic policies. These guidelines were submitted as a report of the Central Committee to the Congress of the CPSU to be approved there. \n After the approval at the congress, the list of priorities for the five-year plan was processed by the Council of Ministers , which constituted the government of the USSR. The Council of Ministers was composed of industrial ministers, chairmen of various state committees, and chairmen of agencies with ministerial status. This committee stood at the apex of the vast economic administration, including the state planning apparatus, the industrial ministries, the trusts (the intermediate level between the ministries and the enterprises), and finally, the state enterprises. The Council of Ministers elaborated on Politburo plan targets and sent them to Gosplan, which gathered data on plan fulfillment. \n [ edit ] Gosplan \n Main article: Gosplan \n Combining the broad goals laid out by the Council of Ministers with data supplied by lower administrative levels regarding the current state of the economy, Gosplan worked out, through trial and error, a set of preliminary plan targets. Among more than twenty state committees, Gosplan headed the government\'s planning apparatus and was by far the most important agency in the economic administration. The task of planners was to balance resources and requirements to ensure that the necessary inputs were provided for the planned output. The planning apparatus alone was a vast organizational arrangement consisting of councils, commissions, governmental officials, specialists, etc. charged with executing and monitoring economic policy. \n The state planning agency was subdivided into its own industrial departments, such as coal , iron , and machine building. It also had summary departments such as finance , dealing with issues that crossed functional boundaries. With the exception of a brief experiment with regional planning during the Khrushchev era in the 1950s, Soviet planning was done on a sectoral basis rather than on a regional basis. The departments of the state planning agency aided the agency\'s development of a full set of plan targets along with input requirements, a process involving bargaining between the ministries and their superiors. \n [ edit ] Planning ministries \n Economic ministries performed key roles in the Soviet organizational structure. When the planning goals had been established by Gosplan , economic ministries drafted plans within their jurisdictions and disseminated planning data to the subordinate enterprises. The planning data were sent downward through the planning hierarchy for progressively more detailed elaboration. The ministry received its control targets, which were then disaggregated by branches within the ministry, then by lower units, eventually until each enterprise received its own control figures (production targets). \n [ edit ] Enterprises \n Enterprises were called upon to develop in the final period of state planning in the late-1980s and early-1990s (even though such participation was mostly limited to a rubber-stamping of prepared statements during huge pre-staged meetings). The enterprises\' draft plans were then sent back up through the planning ministries for review. This process entailed intensive bargaining, with all parties seeking the target levels and input figures that best suited their interests. \n [ edit ] Redrafting the plan \n After this bargaining process, Gosplan received the revised estimates and re-aggregated them as it saw fit. Then, the redrafted plan was sent to the Council of Ministers and the Party\'s Politburo and Central Committee Secretariat for approval. The Council of Ministers submitted the Plan to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee submitted the plan to the Party Congress, both for rubber stamp approval. By this time, the process had been completed and the plan became law. \n [ edit ] Approval of the plan \n The review, revision, and approval of the five-year plan were followed by another downward flow of information, this time with the amended and final plans containing the specific targets for each sector of the economy. Implementation began at this point, and was largely the responsibility of enterprise managers. \n [ edit ] State budget \n The national state budget was prepared by the Ministry of Finance of the USSR by negotiating with its all-Union local organizations. If the state budget was accepted by the Soviet Union , to then get adopted. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Agriculture \n Main article: Agriculture in the Soviet Union \n Agriculture was organized into a system of collective farms ( kolkhozes ) and state farms ( sovkhozes ). Organized on a large scale and highly mechanized, the Soviet Union was one of the world\'s leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a record harvest followed by another drop in overall production in 1979 and 1980 back to levels attained in 1975. Cotton , sugar beets , potatoes , and flax were also major crops. \n However, despite immense land resources, extensive machinery and chemical industries, and a large rural work force, Soviet agriculture was relatively unproductive, [ original research? ] hampered in many areas by the climate (only 10 percent of the Soviet Union\'s land was arable), and poor worker productivity since the collectivization in the 1930s. [ citation needed ] Lack of transport infrastructure also caused much waste. \n A view of poor performance of Soviet collective farms is provided by two historians, M. Heller and A. Nekich ("Utopia in Power, History of the Soviet Union from 1917 to Present," Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1986). The authors report that in 1979, 28% of the Soviet agricultural production was from small plots of private citizens, which represented less than 1% of the cultivated land. So according to them, collective farms operated very inefficiently. \n [ edit ] Foreign trade and currency \n Main article: Foreign trade of the Soviet Union \n Largely self-sufficient, the Soviet Union traded little in comparison to its economic strength. However, trade with noncommunist countries increased in the 1970s as the government sought to compensate gaps in domestic production with imports. \n In general, fuels , metals , and timber were exported. Machinery , consumer goods , and sometimes grain were imported. In the 1980s trade with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) member states accounted for about half the country\'s volume of trade. Although often associated with alcohol production, such as that of vodka , none of these were leading Soviet exports. \n The Soviet currency (ruble) was non-convertible after 1932 (when trade in gold-convertible " chervonets ", introduced by Lenin in NEP years, was suspended) until the late eighties. It was impossible (both for citizens and state-owned businesses) to freely buy or sell foreign currency even though the "exchange rate" was set and published regularly. Buying or selling foreign currency on a black market was a serious crime until the late eighties. Individuals who were paid from abroad (for example writers whose books were published abroad) normally had to spend their currency in a foreign-currency-only chain of state-owned " Beryozka " ("Birch-tree") stores. Once a free conversion of currency was allowed, the exchange rate plummeted from its official values by almost a factor of 10. \n Overall, the banking system was highly centralized and fully controlled by a single state-owned Gosbank , responsive to the fulfillment of the government\'s economic plans. Soviet banks furnished short-term credit to state-owned enterprises. \n [ edit ] Forms of property \n There were two basic forms of property in the Soviet Union: individual property and collective property. These differed greatly in their content and legal status. According to communist theory, capital ( means of production ) should not be individually owned, with certain negligible exceptions. In particular, after the end of a short period of the New Economic Policy and with collectivization completed, all industrial property and virtually all land were collective. \n Land in rural areas was allotted for housing and some sustenance farming, and persons had certain rights to it, but it was not their property in full. In particular, in kolkhozes and sovkhozes there was a practice to rotate individual farming lots with collective lots. This resulted in situations where people would ameliorate , till and cultivate their lots carefully, adapting them to small-scale farming, and in 5\xe2\x80\x937 years those lots would be swapped for kolkhoz ones, typically with exhausted soil due to intensive, large-scale agriculture. There was an extremely small number of remaining individual farmsteads ( khutors \xd1\x85\xd1\x83\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd1\x80), located in isolated rural areas in the Baltic states , Ukraine , Siberia and cossack lands. \n [ edit ] Individual property \n To distinguish "capitalist" and "socialist" types of property ownership further, two different forms of individual property were recognized: private property ( \xd1\x87\xd0\xb0\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , chastnaya sobstvennost) and personal property ( \xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x87\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , lichnaya sobstvennost). The former encompassed capital (means of production), while the latter described everything else in a person\'s possession. This distinction has been a source of confusion when interpreting phrases such as "socialism (communism) abolished private property" ; one might conclude that all individual property was abolished, when this was in fact not the case [ citation needed ] . \n [ edit ] Collective property \n There were several forms of collective ownership, the most significant being state property , kolkhoz property , and cooperative property . The most common forms of cooperative property were housing cooperatives (\xd0\xb6\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x89\xd0\xbd\xd1\x8b\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb2\xd1\x8b) in urban areas, consumer cooperatives (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f, \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f), and rural consumer societies (\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb0, \xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe). \n [ edit ] History \n [ edit ] Early development \n Both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later, the Soviet Union , were countries in the process of industrialization . For both, this development occurred slowly and from a low initial starting point. Because of World War I , the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Russian Civil War industrial production had only managed to barely recover its 1913 level by 1926. [ 21 ] By this time about 18% of the population lived in non-rural areas, although only about 7.5% were employed in the non-agricultural sector. The remainder were stuck in the low productivity agriculture. [ 22 ] \n According to David A. Dyker , the Soviet Union of the 1930s can be regarded as a typical developing country, characterized by low capital investment and most of its population resident in the countryside. Part of the reason for low investment rates lay in the inability to acquire capital from abroad. This in turn, was the result of the repudiation of the debts of the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks , as well as the world wide financial troubles. Consequently, any kind of economic growth had to be financed by domestic savings. [ 22 ] \n The economic problems in agriculture were further acerbated by natural conditions, such as long cold winters across the country, droughts in the south and acidic soils in the north. However, according to Dyker, the Soviet economy did have "extremely good" potential in the area of raw materials and mineral extraction, for example in the oil fields in Transcaucasia , and this, along with a small but growing manufacturing base, helped the USSR avoid any kind of balance of payments problems. [ 22 ] \n [ edit ] New Economic Policy (1921\xe2\x80\x939) \n Main article: New Economic Policy \n \n \n \n  \nThe two major economic policy makers of the USSR, Lenin (left) created the NEP while Stalin (right) created the planned economy \n \n \n By early 1921 it became apparent to the Bolsheviks that forced requisitioning of grain had resulted in low agricultural production and widespread opposition. As a result, the decision was made by Lenin and the Politburo to try an alternative approach. [ 23 ] The so-called New Economic Policy (NEP) was approved at the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) [ 24 ] \n Everything except "the commanding heights", as Lenin put it, of the economy would be privatized . "The commanding heights" included foreign trade , heavy industry , communication and transport among others. [ 23 ] In practice this limited the private sector to artisan and agricultural production/trade. [ 25 ] The NEP encountered strong resistance within the Bolshevik party. Lenin had to persuade communist skeptics that " state capitalism " was a necessary step in achieving communism , while he himself harbored suspicions that the policy could be abused by private businessmen (" NEPmen "). [ 26 ] \n As novelist Andrei Platonov , among others, noted, the improvements were immediate. Rationing cards and queues, which had become hallmarks of war communism , had disappeared. However, due to prolonged war, low harvests, and several natural disasters the Soviet economy was still in trouble, particularly its agricultural sector. In 1921 widespread famine broke out in the Volga-Ural region . The Soviet government changed its previous course and allowed international relief to come in from abroad, and established a special committee chaired by prominent communists and non-communists alike. Despite this, an estimated five million people died in the famine. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Stalinism \n Starting in 1928, the five-year plans began building a heavy industrial base at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. The country now became industrialized at a hitherto unprecedented pace, surpassing Germany \'s pace of industrialization in the 19th century and Japan \'s earlier in the 20th century. \n After the reconstruction of the economy (in the wake of the destruction caused by the Russian Civil War ) was completed, and after the initial plans of further industrialisation were fulfilled, the explosive growth slowed down, but still generally surpassed most of the other countries in terms of total material production ( GNP ) [ citation needed ] until the period of Brezhnev stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s. \n Led by the creation of NAMI , and by the GAZ copy of the Ford Model A in 1929, [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] industrialization came with the extension of medical services, which improved labor productivity . Campaigns were carried out against typhus , cholera , and malaria ; the number of physicians increased as rapidly as facilities and training would permit; and death and infant mortality rates steadily decreased. \n [ edit ] 1930\xe2\x80\x931970 \n \n \n \n  \nThe State Quality Mark of the USSR , introduced in 1967, was used to certify that goods met quality standards, and to improve the efficiency of production \n \n \n As weighed growth rates, economic planning performed very well during the early and mid-1930s, World War II -era mobilization, and for the first two decades of the postwar era. The Soviet Union became the world\'s leading producer of oil , coal , iron ore , and cement ; manganese , gold , natural gas and other minerals were also of major importance. However, information about the Soviet famine of 1932\xe2\x80\x931933 was suppressed by the Soviet authorities until perestroika . In 1933 workers\' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level. [ 30 ] Common and political prisoners in labor camps were forced to do unpaid labor, and communists and Komsomol members were frequently "mobilized" for various construction projects. \n The German invasion of World War II inflicted punishing blows to the economy of the USSR, with Soviet GDP falling 34% between 1940 and 1942. [ 31 ] Industrial output did not recover to its 1940 level for almost a decade. [ 18 ] \n In 1961, a new redenominated Soviet ruble was issued. It maintained exchange parity with the Pound Sterling until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. After a new leadership, headed by Leonid Brezhnev , had come to power, attempts were made to revitalize the economy through economic reform . Starting in 1965, enterprises and organizations were made to rely on economic methods of profitable production, rather than follow orders from the state administration. By 1970, the Soviet economy had reached its zenith and was estimated at about 60 percent of the size of the USA [ citation needed ] in terms of the estimated commodities (like steel and coal). In 1989, the GDP of the Soviet Union was $2,500 Billion [ 32 ] while the GDP of the United States was $4,862 Billion [ 33 ] with per capita income figures as $8,700 and $19,800 respectively. \n \n \n \n  \n \n This article\'s factual accuracy is disputed .

Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR\'s GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. [ citation needed ] The Soviet planned economy was not structured to respond adequately to the demands of the complex modern economy it had helped to forge. The massive quantities of goods produced often did not meet the needs or tastes of consumers. [ 34 ] The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. During 1975\xe2\x80\x9385, corruption and data fiddling became common practice among bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas thus entrenching the crisis. \n Awareness of the growing crisis arose initially within the KGB which with its extensive network of informants in every region and institution had its finger on the pulse of the nation. Yuri Andropov , director of the KGB, created a secret department during the 1970s within the KGB devoted to economic analysis, and when he succeeded Brezhnev in 1982 sounded the alarm forcefully to the Soviet leadership. Andropov\'s remedy of increased discipline, however, proved ineffective. It was only when Andropov\'s protege Gorbachev assumed power that a determined, but ultimately unsuccessful, assault on the economic crisis was undertaken.

It had its origin in 1973 as the Asian Study Group (renamed the Workers\' Viewpoint Organization in 1976) established by Jerry Tung , a former member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) [ 1 ] who had grown disenchanted with the group and disagreed with its new position on nationalism . The party is mainly remembered as the victim of the Greensboro Massacre of 1979. [ 2 ] \n The CWP followed the policies of Mao Zedong , Joseph Stalin , and later Pol Pot , [ 3 ] and originally gave some support to the Islamists of the Iranian Revolution , which it held to be objectively anti-imperialist. It later changed its line on the Iranian revolution and backed the Iranian left opposed to the ruling Ayatollahs. The CWP also incorporated aspects of the CPUSA\'s anti-racist pre- Popular Front program. In particular the CWP emphasized unionization and self-determination for African Americans . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n 2 References \n 3 Publications \n 4 Archives \n 5 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n The CWP enjoyed some success in textile cities of North Carolina. The new party established branches in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, Greensboro, West Virginia, Colorado and other locations. Before forming itself into a party in October 1979 (the founding congress was held in the backroom of a discoth\xc3\xa8que in New York City), the group was known as the Workers Viewpoint Organization. Under its umbrella, it directed groups as the Revolutionary Youth League, the African Liberation Support Committee, and the Trade Union Education League. \n Confrontations with the Klan were particularly acute in Greensboro, North Carolina , where the Klan attempted to disrupt the work of the CWP and vice versa. In July 1979, the Klan held a rally and viewing of The Birth of a Nation in China Grove , near Charlotte , which was disrupted by CWP members who burned a Confederate flag and taunted members of the KKK. There were also challenges in the press. "The KKK is one of the most treacherous scum elements produced by the dying system of capitalism. "We challenge you," CWP leader Paul Bermanzohn taunted the Klan, "to attend our rally in Greensboro." These apparent provocations provided the KKK a pretext for a coming violent showdown. \n On November 3, 1979 members of the KKK, including a police informant, and the American Nazi Party attacked a "Death to the Klan!" rally organized by the CWP. [ 4 ] Members of the Klan were armed, as were some members of the CWP. Two members of the CWP and three rally participants were killed by the KKK. [ 4 ] These murders became known as the " Greensboro Massacre ". [ 4 ] In response to the acquittal of the accused killers, the CWP attempted to storm the 1980 Democratic National Convention and succeeded in setting off firecrackers in Madison Square Garden . [ 5 ] \n From its earliest phase as the Workers\' Viewpoint Organization, the CWP had considered itself as Maoist and supported the so-called Gang of Four after Mao\'s death. Following the line of Mao, it considered the Soviet Union and its bloc as restored capitalist countries. For some time after the arrest of the Gang of Four, the group remained silent about the events in China but later accused China also of having taken the capitalist road. \n In 1980, there was a dramatic reversal of this line. In his book The Socialist Road , CWP Chairman Jerry Tung announced that both the Soviet Union and China were socialist, although an unhealthy bureaucracy had taken shape in the governments of both countries. \n Subsequent to the Greensboro massacre, the group gave up its Leninist structure and moved towards a social democratic formation that would work for peaceful transition to socialism; it dissolved the Communist Workers Party and formed the New Democratic Movement in 1985. The New Democratic Movement lasted only a few years. The most important remnant of the CWP/NDM can be found in the Greensboro Justice Fund which continues to this day and promotes groups struggling for social justice.

The announcement\n     ended the costly full-scale civil war between the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\n     and the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang (KMT), which broke out immediately\n     following World War II and had been preceded by on and off conflict between the\n     two sides since the 1920\'s. The creation of the PRC also completed the long\n     process of governmental upheaval in China begun by the Chinese Revolution of 1911 .\n     The "fall" of mainland China to communism in 1949 led the United States to\n     suspend diplomatic ties with the PRC for decades. \n        \n         Communists entering Beijing in 1949. \n         \n        \n        The Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1921 in Shanghai ,\n     originally existed as a study group working within the confines of the First\n     United Front with the Nationalist Party. Chinese Communists joined with the\n     Nationalist Army in the Northern Expedition of 1926-27 to rid the nation of the\n     warlords that prevented the formation of a strong central government. This\n     collaboration lasted until the "White Terror" of 1927, when the Nationalists\n     turned on the Communists, killing them or purging them from the party. \n        After the Japanese invaded\n      Manchuria in 1931 , the Government of the Republic of China (ROC) faced\n     the triple threat of Japanese invasion, Communist uprising, and warlord\n     insurrections. Frustrated by the focus of the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek\n     on internal threats instead of the Japanese assault, a group of generals\n     abducted Chiang in 1937 and forced him to reconsider cooperation with the\n     Communist army. As with the first effort at cooperation between the Nationalist\n     government and the CCP, this Second United Front was short-lived. The\n     Nationalists expended needed resources on containing the Communists, rather than\n     focusing entirely on Japan, while the Communists worked to strengthen their\n     influence in rural society. \n        During World War II, popular support for the Communists increased. U.S. officials\n     in China reported a dictatorial suppression of dissent in Nationalist-controlled\n     areas. These undemocratic polices combined with wartime corruption made the\n     Republic of China Government vulnerable to the Communist threat. The CCP, for\n     its part, experienced success in its early efforts at land reform and was lauded\n     by peasants for its unflagging efforts to fight against the Japanese\n     invaders. \n        \n         Chiang Kai-shek \n         \n        \n        Japanese surrender set the stage for the resurgence of civil war in China. Though\n     only nominally democratic, the Nationalist Government of Chiang Kai-shek\n     continued to receive U.S. support both as its former war ally and as the sole\n     option for preventing Communist control of China. U.S. forces flew tens of\n     thousands of Nationalist Chinese troops into Japanese-controlled territory and\n     allowed them to accept the Japanese surrender. The Soviet Union, meanwhile,\n     occupied Manchuria and only pulled out when Chinese Communist forces were in\n     place to claim that territory. \n        In 1945, the leaders of the Nationalist and Communist parties, Chiang Kai-shek\n     and Mao Zedong, met for a series of talks on the formation of a post-war\n     government. Both agreed on the importance of democracy, a unified military, and\n     equality for all Chinese political parties. The truce was tenuous, however, and,\n     in spite of repeated efforts by U.S. General George\n      Marshall to broker an agreement, by 1946 the two sides were\n     fighting an all-out civil war. Years of mistrust between the two sides thwarted\n     efforts to form a coalition government. \n        As the civil war gained strength from 1947 to 1949, eventual Communist victory\n     seemed more and more likely. Although the Communists did not hold any major\n     cities after World War II, they had strong grassroots support, superior military\n     organization and morale, and large stocks of weapons seized from Japanese\n     supplies in Manchuria. Years of corruption and mismanagement had eroded popular\n     support for the Nationalist Government. Early in 1947, the ROC Government was\n     already looking to the island province of Taiwan, off the coast of Fujian\n     Province, as a potential point of retreat. Although officials in the Truman\n     Administration were not convinced of the strategic importance to the United\n     States of maintaining relations with Nationalist China, no one in the U.S.\n     Government wanted to be charged with facilitating the "loss" of China to\n     communism. Military and financial aid to the floundering Nationalists continued,\n     though not at the level that Chiang Kai-shek would have liked. In October of\n     1949, after a string of military victories, Mao Zedong proclaimed the\n     establishment of the PRC; Chiang and his forces fled to Taiwan to regroup and\n     plan for their efforts to retake the mainland. \n        The ability of the PRC and the United States to find common ground in the wake of\n     the establishment of the new Chinese state was hampered by both domestic\n     politics and global tensions. In August of 1949, the Truman administration\n     published the "China White Paper," which explained past U.S. policy toward China\n     based upon the principle that only Chinese forces could determine the outcome of\n     their civil war. Unfortunately for Truman, this step failed to protect his\n     administration from charges of having "lost" China. The unfinished nature of the\n     revolution, leaving a broken and exiled but still vocal Nationalist Government\n     and army on Taiwan, only heightened the sense among U.S. anti-communists that\n     the outcome of the struggle could be reversed. The outbreak of the Korean War,\n     which pitted the PRC and the United States on opposite sides of an international\n     conflict, ended any opportunity for accommodation between the PRC and the United\n     States. Truman\'s desire to prevent the Korean conflict from spreading south led\n     to the U.S. policy of protecting the Chiang Kai-shek government on Taiwan. \n        For more than twenty years after the Chinese revolution of 1949, there were few\n     contacts, limited trade and no diplomatic ties between the two countries. Until the 1970s , the United States\n     continued to recognize the Republic of China, located on Taiwan, as China\'s true\n     government and supported that government\'s holding the Chinese seat in the\n     United Nations. \n       \n       \n        \n         \xc2\xab Previous \n         \n         Next \xc2\xbb \n         \n        \n            \n     \n    \n    \n    \n     \n      \n       Home | About Us | Contact Us | FAQ | Privacy Notice | External Link Policy | Copyright Info | Search Office of the Historian, Bureau of Public Affairs,\n     United States Department of State'

ALBANY \xe2\x80\x94 Who are Wilson and Pakula and why is their arcane 1947 law a major issue in Albany today? Wilson-Pakula is the original party crasher law, created during America\'s Red Scare to keep socialists and communists from infiltrating political parties and taking them over from within. In a measure that may only make sense in New York\'s power politics, it places extraordinary power in the hands of political party bosses. It allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. Today, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson, who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. In April, Bharara accused Democratic Sen. Malcolm Smith of Queens of trying to bribe his way onto the Republican line to run for New York City mayor. Smith denies the charge and state Republican Chairman Ed Cox said his party would never have accepted Smith. Now, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to dismantle Wilson-Pakula. He wants to take away the power of party chairmen to grant waivers allowing an insider onto the party line. Instead, Cuomo wants to create a petition process that would require broader political support by party members. "You have heard the expression \'pay to play\'?" Cuomo said, referring to the practice in which lobbyists make campaign donations to get or stop legislation. "This is \'pay to run.\' "The allegation is that the minor parties basically, on occasion, have used campaign contributions to determine who gets the line," Cuomo said. "It\'s almost that the line goes to the highest bidder." The Independent Democratic Conference, which shares majority control of the Senate with Republicans, also supports repeal. Wilson-Pakula, however, is being defended by the unlikeliest band of liberals, conservatives, moderates and disenfranchised voters equally disgusted by the Democratic and Republican parties. Supporters pose a scenario in which a wealthy candidate \xe2\x80\x94 for example, a conservative \xe2\x80\x94 could organize enough supporters to infiltrate a minor party of liberals and collect votes from liberals who assumed the candidate shared their values. The next step, supporters portend, would include Republicans and Democrats infiltrating the opposition party, resulting in two parties indistinguishable from each other or, worse, a de facto single party. "We respectfully disagree with anyone who wants to change the Wilson-Pakula law," said Frank MacKay, chairman of the state Independence Party. "Without Wilson-Pakula, a wealthy candidate could override the philosophy of a party which he has nothing in common with." On this, many liberals and conservatives agree. "Hey, I don\'t like the Working Families Party," said state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long. "But they stand for a set of principles and enunciate a set of principles. ... We feel this is important for this nation. It would really end a philosophical bent to political parties in New York." The liberal Working Families Party agrees. "The governor\'s proposal will cause a tremendous amount of confusion and chaos among voters and is a direct attack on the rights of minor parties to be effective participants in New York politics," said Dan Cantor, executive director of the party. "We know a lot of people vote on our line and we know a lot don\'t. But they\'ve come to rely on our line meaning something," Cantor said. "The governor is trying to make ideas even less important in politics. And that\'s a bad thing." The Green Party, another liberal force, calls efforts to repeal Wilson-Pakula an assault on the First Amendment and a move that would make well-funded candidates even more powerful. Cuomo has more than $20 million in his campaign fund and the Democratic line in a state dominated nearly 2-to-1 by Democratic voters. He has no need to run on a minor party line, but for his Republican opponent, additional lines will be essential. "Cuomo and the Independent Democratic Conference aren\'t interested in preventing corruption," said Gloria Mattera, co-chairwoman of the Green Party. "They just want to further weaken political parties and make it easier for the candidates with the most money to buy elections." \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Text Only \n | Photo Reprints \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n Copyright \n 2013\n The Associated Press.

It was founded in 1988 to secure the existence of an independent Marxist-Leninist party. Since its founding, it has not gained seats in the parliament, and as a result, has been removed from the party register and re-registered three times. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n 2 Politics \n 3 Organization \n 4 Electoral performance \n 5 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n The Finnish Communist movement was split in the mid-1980s after years of infighting. Those expelled from the Communist Party of Finland (SKP) formed the Communist Party of Finland (Unity) (SKPy) which, however, itself soon split into different factions. KTP was founded in 1988 by one part of Finnish Communists who thought the SKPy had ventured too far from the principles of Marxism-Leninism . The final decision to found a new registered Communist party was made in the autumn 1987 seminar held at Matinkyl\xc3\xa4 . The Marxist-Leninists behind the project felt themselves neglected since the Dipoli congress of the SKPy in 1986. Many of the KTP cadres came from the (expelled) Uusimaa district of the SKP which, since the late 1970s, had had its disputes with the opposition of the SKP led by the Tiedonantaja society . \n In 2002 the KTP split over question of alliances possible for a Communist party. The Central Committee of the KTP rejected after voting (18\xe2\x80\x939) a proposed membership in a new (electoral) party, Forces for Change in Finland (MVS), in which clearly right-wing elements were also going to participate. MVS was supported especially by the Helsinki district organization of the KTP which then decided to enter the MVS without their comrades. KTP answered by expelling the above mentioned organization and many leading members of the party, including Heikki M\xc3\xa4nnikk\xc3\xb6 (the party secretary), Reijo Katajaranta (the editor-in-chief of the KTP organ) and Pekka Tiainen (the former presidential candidate in 1994), had to go. The Communists expelled then found their own organization, which was at first called plainly Communists , but later changed to League of Communists (or Communist League). The KTP has avoided contacts to their ex-members. \n The KTP got some unexpected nationwide, and even international, publicity ahead the local elections in 2004 when the Turku and Raisio branches of the party made an electoral alliance with the far-right racist [ citation needed ] Finnish People\'s Blue-whites (SKS). [ citation needed ] The party leadership reacted strongly and condemned the manoeuvres. The alliances were, however, already signed and the KTP candidates stood in the two west coast cities with no success, although the KTP didn\'t advertise their rebel candidates. The man behind the alliances, Esko Luukkonen , was discharged from all party responsibilities, and he (and the KTP Turku district organization) later joined the League of Communists. \n [ edit ] Politics \n The founders of the KTP were former supporters of the SKP opposition and as such came from the brezhnevist tradition of Marxism-Leninism. The critique of the late Soviet Union has been, however, included in the party ideology from the beginning. In 1998, for example, the KTP announced that the estimations made on the nature of the era, during the 1970s and the 1980s, were no longer realistic or correct. Yet the Marxism-Leninism of the KTP is far from Eurocommunism . The party leaders may quote Joseph Stalin and traditional Leninist rhetoric is required. \n The existence of an independent Communist party, which is not buried in any unprincipled coalition, has always been one of the central political issues in the KTP. Markus Kainulainen , probably the best known politician in the KTP, was one of those who, already in 1969, in the then SKP, was in favor of a new party unlike the majority of the party opposition. In the 1980s, the KTP used to criticise the SKPy for not officially registering the party. \n The KTP is strictly against the European Union , the Euro currency and Finland\'s participation in these capitalist formations. The party has consistently boycotted the elections of European Parliament . \n The KTP wholeheartedly supports the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and its current leadership. The party has published writings of Kim Jong-Il and many members of the KTP are actively participating in The Society for the Study of the Juche Idea . \n [ edit ] Organization \n Every year, the KTP holds its party congresses in which the official delegates choose the members of the important Central Committee. Little change usually happens and Hannu Harju has led the party since the 1997 congress. He was preceded by Timo Lahdenm\xc3\xa4ki . \n The KTP has been a small party all its life and it currently has some 200 members. The candidates of the KTP in the parliamentary elections have failed to get the attention of voters and the party has managed to gather only a few thousand votes. The KTP has some local strongholds, like the city of Kemi in northern Finland where Pirkko Ezewuzie is the lone KTP councillor. The party, with its own lists, has also participated in the elections of some trade unions and cooperatives. \n The KTP has international contacts even though the party is not a member of any international organization. The Russian Communist Workers\' Party \xe2\x80\x93 Revolutionary Party of Communists has warm relations with the KTP as well as the Nordic Communist Party of Sweden (SKP), Communist Party in Denmark (KPiD) and Communist Party of Norway (NKP). \n Ty\xc3\xb6kansan Sanomat (TKS), which appears fifteen times a year, is the organ of the KTP. The current editor-in-chief of TKS is Hannu Tuominen . In local (Helsinki area) L\xc3\xa4hiradio radio station the KTP has a weekly program called Ty\xc3\xb6v\xc3\xa4en puolituntinen . \n [ edit ] Electoral performance \n \n \n Parliamentary elections \n \n \n Year \n Elected \n Votes \n Share \n \n \n 1991 \n 0 \n 6,201 \n 0.22% \n \n \n 1995 \n 0 \n 4,784 \n 0.17% \n \n \n 1999 \n 0 \n 3,455 \n 0.13% \n \n \n 2003 \n 0 \n 2,908 \n 0.10% \n \n \n 2007 \n 0 \n 2,007 \n 0.07% \n \n \n 2011 \n 0 \n 1,575 \n 0.05% \n \n \n \n &#160; \n &#160; \n &#160; \n Local elections \n \n \n Year \n Elected \n Votes \n Share \n \n \n 1992 \n 1 \n 4,828 \n 0.18% \n \n \n 1996 \n 3 \n 4,483 \n 0.19% \n \n \n 2000 \n 2 \n 2,314 \n 0.10% \n \n \n 2004 \n 1 \n 1,248 \n 0.05% \n \n \n 2008 \n 0 \n 1,065 \n 0.04% \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] External links \n \n Official website \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n  Political parties in Finland \n \n \n \n \n \n \n MPs in parliament \n \n \n \n National Coalition Party (44) \n Social Democratic Party of Finland (42) \n True Finns (39) \n Centre Party (35) \n Left Alliance (14) \n Green League (10) \n Swedish People\'s Party of Finland (9+ 1 ) \n Christian Democrats (6) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Other registered parties \n \n \n \n Independence Party \n For The Poor \n Workers Party of Finland \n Pirate Party \n Change 2011 \n Freedom Party \n Communist Party of Finland \n Communist Workers\' Party \xe2\x80\x93 For Peace and Socialism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Unregistered parties \n \n \n \n Finnish Seniors\' Party \n Finnish Islamic Party \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Portal:Politics \n List of political parties \n Politics of Finland \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communist_Workers%27_Party_\xe2\x80\x93_For_Peace_and_Socialism&amp;oldid=551264280 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Communist parties in Finland Political parties established in 1988 Political parties in Finland  Hidden categories: Articles containing Finnish language text All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements from June 2009  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation menu \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n Create account Log in \t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Article \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Navigation \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Contents \n\t\t\t Featured content \n\t\t\t Current events \n\t\t\t Random article \n\t\t\t Donate to Wikipedia \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Interaction \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t\t About Wikipedia \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Contact Wikipedia \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Upload file \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t\t Page information \n Cite this page \t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Print/export \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Create a book \n\t\t\t Download as PDF \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c \n\t\t\t Suomi \n\t\t\t Svenska \n\t\t\t Edit links \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 20 April 2013 at 10:24. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.

These revolutions would not necessarily occur simultaneously, but where local conditions allowed a revolutionary party to successfully replace bourgeois ownership and rule, and install a workers\' state based on social ownership of the means of production. In most Marxist schools, such as Trotskyism , the essentially international character of the class struggle and the necessity of global scope are critical elements and a chief explanation of the failure of socialism in one country . \n The end goal is to achieve world socialism , and later, stateless communism . [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Communist movements \n \n 1.1 Post World War Two \n \n \n 2 See also \n 3 References \n 4 External links \n \n \n \n \n Communist movements \n The October Revolution of 1917 in Russia sparked a revolutionary wave of socialist and communist uprisings across Europe, most notably the German Revolution , the Hungarian Revolution , Biennio Rosso and the revolutionary war in Finland with the short lived Finnish Socialist Workers\' Republic , which made large gains and met with considerable success in the early stages; see also Revolutions of 1917-23 . \n Particularly in the years 1918-1919, it seemed plausible that capitalism would soon be swept from the European continent forever. Given the fact that European powers controlled the majority of Earth\'s land surface at the time, such an event could have meant the end of capitalism not just in Europe, but everywhere. Additionally, the Comintern , founded in March 1919, began as an independent international organization of communists from various countries around the world that evolved after the Russian Civil War into an essentially Soviet -sponsored agency responsible for coordinating the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism worldwide. \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n Revolutions are the locomotives of history. \n \xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x94 Karl Marx  [ 3 ] \n \n \n \n With the prospect of world revolution so close at hand, Marxists were dominated by a feeling of overwhelming optimism, which in the end proved to be quite premature. The European revolutions were crushed one by one, until eventually the Russian revolutionaries found themselves to be the only survivors. Since they had been relying on the idea that an underdeveloped and agrarian country like Russia would be able to build socialism with help from successful revolutionary governments in the more industrialized parts of Europe, they found themselves in a crisis once it became clear that no such help would arrive; see Socialism in one country . \n After those events and up until the present day, the international situation never came quite so close to a world revolution again. As fascism grew in Europe in the 1930s, instead of immediate revolution, the Comintern opted for a Popular Front with liberal capitalists against fascism; then, at the height of World War II in 1943, the Comintern was disbanded on the request of the Soviet Union\'s Western allies. \n Post World War Two \n A new upsurge of revolutionary feeling swept across Europe in the aftermath of World War II , though it was not as strong as the one triggered by World War I which resulted in failed (in the socialist sense) revolution in Germany and a successful one (for seventy years) in Russia. Communist parties in countries such as Greece , France , and Italy had acquired significant prestige and public support due to their activity as leaders of anti-fascist resistance movements during the war; as such, they also enjoyed considerable success at the polls and regularly finished second in elections in the late 1940s. However, none managed to finish in first and form a government. Communist parties in Eastern Europe , meanwhile, though they did win elections at around the same time, did so under circumstances regarded by some as mere show elections . \n Revolts across the world in the 1960s and early 1970s, coupled with the Chinese Cultural Revolution , the establishment of the New Left together with the Civil Rights Movement , the militancy of the Black Panther Party and similar armed/insurrectionary "Liberation Front" groups around the globe, and even a bit of a resurgence in the labor movement for a time once again made it seem to some as though world revolution was not only possible, but actually imminent; thus, there was a common expression, " The East is Red , and the West is Ready". However, this radical left spirit ebbed by the mid-1970s, and in 1980s and 1990s there was a return to certain right-wing , economically conservative ideologies (spearheaded, among other examples, by Thatcherism in the United Kingdom and Reaganomics in the United States ) and also free-market reforms in China and in Vietnam . \n Within Marxist theory , Lenin \'s concept of the labor aristocracy and his description of imperialism , and&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 separately, but not necessarily unrelatedly&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 Trotsky \'s theories regarding the deformed workers\' state , offer several explanations as to why the world revolution has not occurred to the present day. Many groups, however, such as the Progressive Labor Party (United States) , still explicitly pursue the goal of worldwide communist revolution, calling it the truest expression of proletarian internationalism . \n See also \n \n \n \n Wikimedia Commons has media related to: World revolution posters of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n Proletarian internationalism \n Social Patriotism \n Stateless communism \n Workers of the world, unite! \n World communism \n \n References \n \n \n ^  The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism by Bukharin \n ^  The State and Revolution \xe2\x80\x94 Chapter 5 \n ^  Stalin in Power: The Revolution from Above 1928-1941 by Robert C.

Both referred to economic systems in which the government owns the means of production. The two terms diverged in meaning largely as a result of the political theory and practice of Vladimir Lenin (1870\xe2\x80\x931924). \n      \n      \n       Like most contemporary socialists, Lenin believed that socialism could not be attained without violent revolution. But no one pursued the logic of revolution as rigorously as he. After deciding that violent revolution would not happen spontaneously, Lenin concluded that it must be engineered by a quasi-military party of professional revolutionaries, which he began and led. After realizing that the revolution would have many opponents, Lenin determined that the best way to quell resistance was with what he frankly called \xe2\x80\x9cterror\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94mass executions, slave labor, and starvation. After seeing that the majority of his countrymen opposed communism even after his military triumph, Lenin concluded that one-party dictatorship must continue until it enjoyed unshakeable popular support. In the chaos of the last years of World War I, Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s tactics proved an effective way to seize and hold power in the former Russian Empire. Socialists who embraced Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s methods became known as \xe2\x80\x9ccommunists\xe2\x80\x9d and eventually came to power in China, Eastern Europe, North Korea, Indo-China, and elsewhere. \n      \n      \n       The most important fact to understand about the economics of communism is that communist revolutions triumphed only in heavily agricultural societies. 1 Government ownership of the means of production could not, therefore, be achieved by expropriating a few industrialists. Lenin recognized that the government would have to seize the land of tens of millions of peasants, who surely would resist. He tried during the Russian Civil War (1918\xe2\x80\x931920), but retreated in the face of chaos and five million famine deaths. Lenin\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Joseph Stalin, finished the job a decade later, sending millions of the more affluent peasants (\xe2\x80\x9ckulaks\xe2\x80\x9d) to Siberian slave labor camps to forestall organized resistance and starving the rest into submission. \n      \n      \n       The mechanism of Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterror famine\xe2\x80\x9d was simple. Collectivization reduced total food production. The exiled kulaks had been the most advanced farmers, and after becoming state employees, the remaining peasants had little incentive to produce. But the government\xe2\x80\x99s quotas drastically increased. The shortage came out of the peasants\xe2\x80\x99 bellies. Robert Conquest explains: \n       Agricultural production had been drastically reduced, and the peasants driven off by the millions to death and exile, with those who stayed reduced, in their own view, to serfs. But the State now controlled grain production, however reduced in quantity. And collective farming had prevailed. 2 \n      \n      \n            \n      \n       In the capitalist West, industrialization was a by-product of rising agricultural productivity . As output per farmer increased, fewer farmers were needed to feed the population . Those no longer needed in agriculture moved to cities and became industrial workers. Modernization and rising food production went hand in hand. Under communism, in contrast, industrialization accompanied falling agricultural productivity. The government used the food it wrenched from the peasants to feed industrial workers and pay for exports. The new industrial workers were, of course, former peasants who had fled the wretched conditions of the collective farms. 3 \n      \n      \n       One of the most basic concepts in economics is the production possibilities frontier (PPF), which shows feasible combinations of, for example, wheat and steel. If the frontier remains fixed, more steel means less wheat. In the noncommunist world, industrialization was a continuous outward shift of the PPF driven by technological change ( Figure 1 ). In the communist world, industrialization was a painful movement along the PPF; or, to be more precise, it moved along the PPF as it shifted in ( Figure 2 ). \n      \n      \n       The other distinctive feature of Soviet industrialization was that few manufactured products ever reached consumers. The emphasis was on \xe2\x80\x9cheavy industry\xe2\x80\x9d such as steel and coal. This is puzzling until one realizes that the term \xe2\x80\x9cindustrialization\xe2\x80\x9d is a misnomer. What happened in the Soviet Union during the 1930s was not industrialization, but militarization, an arms build-up greater than that by any other nation in the world, including Nazi Germany. 4 Martin Malia explains: \n       Contrary to the declared goals of the regime, it was the opposite of a system of production to create abundance for the eventual satisfaction of the needs of the population; it was a system of general squeeze of the population to produce capital goods for the creation of industrial power, in order to produce ever more capital goods with which to produce still further industrial might, and ultimately to produce armaments. 5 \n      \n      \n       Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s apologists argue that Germany forced militarization on him. In truth, Stalin not only began World War II as Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s active ally against Poland, but also saw the war as a golden opportunity for communist expansion: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Soviet government made clear in its Comintern circular of September 1939 that stimulation of the \xe2\x80\x98second imperialist war\xe2\x80\x99 was in the interests of the Soviet Union and of world revolution, while maintaining the peace was not.\xe2\x80\x9d 6 \n      \n      \n       Foolish as he looked after Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s double-cross in 1941, Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was correct. After World War II, the USSR installed communist regimes throughout Eastern Europe. More significantly, Japan \xe2\x80\x99s defeat created a power vacuum in Asia, allowing Mao Zedong to establish a Leninist dictatorship in mainland China. The European puppets closely followed the Soviet model, but their greater prewar level of development made the transition less deadly. Mao, in contrast, pursued even more radical economic policies than Stalin, culminating in the Great Leap Forward (1958\xe2\x80\x931960). Thirty million Chinese starved to death in a rerun of Soviet collectivization. \n      \n      \n       After Stalin\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1953, the economic policies of the Soviet Union and its European satellites moderated. Most slave laborers were released, and the camps became prisons for dissidents instead of enterprises for the cheap harvest of remote resources. Communist regimes put more emphasis on consumer goods and food production, and less on the military. But their economic pedigree remained obvious. Military strength was the priority, and consumer goods and food were an afterthought. \n      \n      \n       The most common economic criticism of the Soviet bloc has long been its failure to use incentives. This is a half-truth. 7 As Hedrick Smith explained in The Russians, the party leadership used incentives in the sectors where it really wanted results: \n       Not only do defense and space efforts get top national priority and funding, but they also operate on a different system from the rest of the economy. Samuel Pisar, an American lawyer, writer, and consultant on East-West trade, made the shrewd observation to me that the military sector is \xe2\x80\x9cthe only sector of the Soviet economy which operates like a market economy, in the sense that the customers pull out of the economic mechanism the kinds of weaponry they want.. . . The military, like customers in the West . . . can say, \xe2\x80\x98No, no, no, that isn\xe2\x80\x99t what we want.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d 8 \n      \n      \n       In a sense, the collapse of communism would not have surprised Lenin. Lenin knew that the party needed terror until it had solid popular support. When Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power, popular support had not materialized even in the USSR, much less in its European satellites. Gorbachev dismantled the apparatus of terror with blinding speed, undoing seven decades of intimidation in a few years. The result was the rapid end of communism in the satellites in 1989, followed by the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991. A patchwork quilt of nationalisms proved far more popular than Marxism -Leninism ever was. \n      \n      \n       \n       Figure 1 \xc2\xa0Normal Industrialization and the PPF \n       \n       \n        \n       \n       \n       \n      \n      \n       \n       Figure 2 \xc2\xa0Communist Industrialization and the PPF \n       \n       \n        \n       \n       \n       \n      \n      \n       Much, but not all, of the former Soviet bloc now has markedly more economic and political freedom\xe2\x80\x94changes visible respectively in the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) study and Freedom House (FH) country rankings ( Table 1 ). In 1988, the republics of the Soviet Union had economic freedom scores below 1. 9 In the same year, Freedom House classified the entire Soviet bloc as \xe2\x80\x9cnot free,\xe2\x80\x9d except for \xe2\x80\x9cpartly free\xe2\x80\x9d Poland and Hungary. \n      \n      \n       Free-market reforms have been harshly criticized, especially the drastic reforms derided as \xe2\x80\x9cshock therapy.\xe2\x80\x9d But the countries that reformed the most have seen the greatest rise in their standard of living, and those that resist change continue to do poorly. 10 Critics lament large measured declines in output, but much of the \xe2\x80\x9clost output\xe2\x80\x9d consists in products for which there was little consumer demand in the first place. Many former communist nations suffered hyperinflation , but only because\xe2\x80\x94ignoring all sensible economic advice\xe2\x80\x94they printed money to cover massive budget deficits. The \xe2\x80\x9cshock therapy\xe2\x80\x9d prescription would have been to slash government spending and/or sell more state assets. \n       \n       \n        \n        \n         \n         \n         Table 1 The Rise in Economic Freedom (EFW) and Political Freedom (FH) \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n         \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        Country \n        2002 Economic Freedom Score \n        2002 Political Freedom Classification \n        \n         \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        Bulgaria \n        6.0 \n        F \n        \n        Czech Republic \n        6.9 \n        F \n        \n        Estonia \n        7.7 \n        F \n        \n        Hungary \n        7.3 \n        F \n        \n        Latvia \n        7.0 \n        F \n        \n        Lithuania \n        6.8 \n        F \n        \n        Poland \n        6.4 \n        F \n        \n        Romania \n        5.4 \n        F \n        \n        Russia \n        5.0 \n        PF \n        \n        Slovak Republic \n        6.6 \n        F \n        \n        Ukraine \n        5.3 \n        PF \n        \n         \n         \n         \n        \n        \n        \n         Sources: \n         http://www.freetheworld.com/2004/2004dataset.xls ; http://www.freedomhouse.org/ratings/allscore04.xls . \n        \n        \n         Notes: EFW scores range, 0\xe2\x80\x9310, 10 being freest; Freedom House classifies countries as free (F), partly free (PF), or not free (NF). \n        \n       \n       \n       \n      \n      \n       China followed a different path away from communism. After the death of Mao in 1976, his successors essentially privatized agriculture, allowing relatively normal development to begin. Economic freedom increased significantly, but China remains a one-party dictatorship. Some attribute its impressive economic growth to this combination of moderate economic freedom and authoritarian rule. In large part, however, the growth reflects the abject poverty of Maoist China; it is easy to double production if you start near zero. \n      \n      \n       During the twentieth century, avowed socialists came to power around the world, but only the followers of Lenin approximated the original goal of abolishing private property in the means of production. Dictatorship and terror were the necessary means, and few noncommunist politicians wholeheartedly embraced them. The communists\xe2\x80\x99 willingness to wage total war on their own people sets them apart. \n      \n      \n      \n       About the Author \n       \n       Bryan Caplan is an associate professor of economics at George Mason University.

The International intended to fight "by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and for the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the State." [ 1 ] \n The Comintern was founded after the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference [ clarification needed ] in which Vladimir Lenin had organized the " Zimmerwald Left " against those who refused to approve any statement explicitly endorsing socialist revolutionary action, and after the 1916 dissolution of the Second International . \n The Comintern had seven World Congresses between 1919 and 1935. It also had thirteen "Enlarged Plenums" of its governing Executive Committee , which had much the same function as the somewhat larger and more grandiose Congresses.

(March 2011)  \n \n \n While the differences had been evident for decades, World War I proved the issue that finally divided the revolutionary and reformist wings of the workers\' movement . The socialist movement had been historically antimilitarist and internationalist , and therefore opposed workers serving as "cannon fodder" for the "bourgeois" governments at war. This especially since the Triple Alliance (1882) comprised two empires, while the Triple Entente gathered the French Third Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland into an alliance with the Russian Empire . The Communist Manifesto had stated that "the working class has no country " and exclaimed " Proletarians of all countries, unite! " Massive majorities voted in favor of resolutions for the Second International to call upon the international working class to resist war if it was declared. \n Nevertheless, within hours of the declarations of war, almost all the socialist parties of the combatant states announced their support for their own respective countries. The only exceptions were the socialist parties of the Balkans , Russia , and tiny minorities in other countries. To Lenin\'s surprise, even the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) voted in favor of war credits. The assassination of French socialist Jean Jaur\xc3\xa8s on July 31, 1914 killed the last hope of peace by removing one of the few leaders who possessed enough influence on the international socialist movement to prevent it from segmenting itself along national lines and supporting governments of National Unity . \n Socialist parties of neutral countries for the most part continued to argue for neutrality rather than for total opposition to the war. On the other hand, during the 1915 Zimmerwald Conference , Lenin organized opposition to the " imperialist war" into a movement that became known as the "Zimmerwald Left" and published the pamphlet Socialism and War , in which he called all socialists who collaborated with their national governments " social-chauvinists ", that is, socialists in word but chauvinists in deed. \n The International was dividing into a revolutionary left and a reformist right, with a center group wavering between those poles. Lenin condemned much of the center as social-pacifists for several reasons, but partly because while they opposed the war they refused to break party discipline and voted for war credits. The term "social-pacifist" aimed in particular at Ramsay MacDonald , leader of the Independent Labour Party in Britain , who opposed the war on grounds of pacifism but did not actively resist it. \n Discredited by its passivity towards world events, the Second International dissolved in the middle of the war in 1916. In 1917 Lenin published the April Theses , which openly supported a " revolutionary defeatism ": the Bolsheviks pronounced themselves in favor of the defeat of Russia which would permit them to move directly to the stage of a revolutionary insurrection . \n Impact of the Russian Revolution \n The victory of the Russian Communist Party in the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917 was felt throughout the world. An alternative path to power to parliamentary politics was demonstrated. With much of Europe on the verge of economic and political collapse in the aftermath of the carnage of the Great War, revolutionary sentiments were widespread. The Russian Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin , believed that unless socialist revolution swept Europe, they would be crushed by the military might of world capitalism, just as the Paris Commune had been crushed by force of arms in 1871. To this end, the organization of a new international to foment revolution in Europe and around the world became to the Bolsheviks a necessity. \n Founding Congress \n Main article: Founding Congress of the Comintern \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Core tenets \n \n \n \n Communism \n Vanguard party \n Democratic centralism \n Central planning \n Proletarian internationalism \n Marxist\xe2\x80\x92Leninist atheism \n Single-party state \n Socialist patriotism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Topics \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n Stalinism \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Khrushchevism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Vladimir Lenin \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n Ernst Th\xc3\xa4lmann \n \n \n Earl Browder \n \n \n Gonchigiin Bumtsend \n \n \n Josip Broz Tito \n Fidel Castro \n \n \n Che Guevara \n Mao Zedong \n \n \n Deng Xiaoping \n Ho Chi Minh \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Mathieu K\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9kou \n \n \n Agostinho Neto \n Samora Machel \n \n \n Thomas Sankara \n Alfonso Cano \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Literature \n \n \n \n Wage Labour and Capital \n Materialism and Empirio-criticism \n Imperialism &#160;&#160; (Lenin) \n What Is to Be Done? \n The State and Revolution \n \n Dialectical and \nHistorical Materialism \n \n On Contradiction \n Guerrilla Warfare \n \n Fundamentals of \nMarxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History \n \n \n \n Great October Socialist Revolution \n \n \n Soviet Union \n Comintern \n \n \n Hungarian Soviet Republic \n \n \n Spanish Civil War \n World War II \n \n \n Warsaw Pact \n Greek Civil War \n \n \n Chinese Revolution \n \n \n Korean War \n Cuban Revolution \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n \n \n Non-Aligned Movement \n \n \n Sino-Soviet split \n Vietnam War \n \n \n Portuguese Colonial War \n \n \n Nicaraguan Revolution \n \n \n Nepalese Civil War \n \n \n Naxalite-Maoist insurgency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Bolshevism \n Leninism \n \n \n Maoism \n Marxism \n \n \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Titoism \n Trotskyism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communism portal \n Politics portal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n The Comintern was founded in these conditions at a Congress held in Moscow March 2\xe2\x80\x936, 1919, [ 2 ] against the backdrop of the Russian Civil War . There were 52 delegates present from 34 parties. [ 3 ] They decided to form an Executive Committee with representatives of the most important sections and that other parties joining the International would have their own representatives. The Congress decided that the Executive Committee would elect a five-member bureau to run the daily affairs of the International. However, such a bureau was not formed and Lenin, Trotsky and Christian Rakovsky later delegated the task of managing the International to Grigory Zinoviev as the Chairman of the Executive. Zinoviev was assisted by Angelica Balabanoff , acting as the secretary of the International, Victor L. Kibaltchitch [ 4 ] and Vladmir Ossipovich Mazin . [ 5 ] Lenin, Trotsky and Alexandra Kollontai presented material. The main topic of discussion was the difference between " bourgeois democracy " and the " dictatorship of the proletariat ". [ 6 ] \n The following parties and movements were invited to the Founding Congress: \n \n  Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) \n  Spartacus League ( Germany ) \n  Communist Party of German Austria \n  Hungarian Communist Workers\' Party , in power during B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s  Hungarian Soviet Republic \n  Communist Party of Finland \n  Communist Party of Poland \n  Communist Party of Estonia \n  Communist Party of Latvia \n  Lithuanian CP \n  Communist Party (bolsheviks) of Byelorussia \n  Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (Ukrainian section of Russian CP, same party basically) \n  The revolutionary elements of the Czech social democracy \n  Social Democratic and Labour Party of Bulgaria ( Tesnyatsi ) \n  Romanian Social Democratic Party \n  Left-wing of the Serbian SDP \n  Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden \n  The Norwegian Labour Party \n  For Denmark , the Klassekampen group \n  Communist Party of the Netherlands \n  Revolutionary elements of the Belgian Labour Party (who would create the Communist Party of Belgium in 1921) \n  Groups and organisations within the French socialist and syndicalist movements \n  Left wing within the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland \n  Italian Socialist Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Spanish Socialist Workers\' Party \n  Revolutionary elements of the Portuguese Socialist Party \n  British socialist parties (particularly the current represented by John Maclean ) \n  Socialist Labour Party (Great Britain) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (Great Britain) \n  Revolutionary elements of the workers\' organisations of Ireland \n  Revolutionary elements among the Shop stewards (Great Britain) \n  Socialist Labor Party of the United States \n  Left elements of the Socialist Party of America (the tendency represented by Eugene Debs and the Socialist Propaganda League of America ) \n  Industrial Workers of the World (United States) \n  Industrial Workers of the World ( Australia ) \n  Workers\' International Industrial Union (United States) \n  The Socialist groups of Tokyo and Yokohama ( Japan , represented by Sen Katayama ) \n Socialist Youth International (represented by Willi M\xc3\xbcnzenberg ) [ 7 ] \n \n Of these, the following attended: the Communist Parties of Russia, Germany, German Austria, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia, Estonia, Armenia, the Volga German region; the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party (the opposition), Balkan Revolutionary People\'s of Russia; Zimmerwald Left Wing of France; the Czech, Bulgarian, Yugoslav, British, French and Swiss Communist Groups; the Dutch Social-Democratic Group; Socialist Propaganda League and the Socialist Labor Party of America; Socialist Workers\' Party of China; Korean Workers\' Union, Turkestan, Turkish, Georgian, Azerbaijanian and Persian Sections of the Central Bureau of the Eastern People\'s, and the Zimmerwald Commission. [ 3 ]  [ 8 ] \n Grigory Zinoviev served as the first Chairman of the Comintern\'s Executive Committee from 1919 to 1926, but its dominant figure until his death in January 1924 was Lenin, whose strategy for revolution had been laid out in What Is to Be Done? (1902). The central policy of the Comintern under Lenin\'s leadership was that Communist parties should be established across the world to aid the international proletarian revolution . The parties also shared his principle of democratic centralism , "freedom of discussion, unity of action", that is, that parties would make decisions democratically, but uphold in a disciplined fashion whatever decision was made. [ 9 ] In this period, the Comintern was promoted as the " General Staff of the World Revolution ." [ 10 ] \n Second World Congress \n \n Main article: 2nd World Congress of the Comintern . \n \n \n \n \n  \nSecond Congress of the Communist International. 1920. \n \n \n Ahead of the Second Congress of the Communist International, held in July through August 1920, Lenin sent out a number of documents, including his Twenty-one Conditions to all socialist parties. The Congress adopted the 21 conditions as prerequisites for any group wanting to become affiliated to the International. The 21 Conditions called for the demarcation between Communist parties and other socialist groups, [ 11 ] and instructed the Comintern sections not to trust the legality of the bourgeois states. They also called for the build-up of party organisations along democratic centralist lines, in which the party press and parliamentary factions would be under the direct control of the party leadership. \n Regarding the political situation in the colonized world, the second congress of the Communist International stipulated that a united front should be formed between the proletariat, peasantry and national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. Amongst the twenty-one conditions drafted by Lenin ahead of the congress was the 11th thesis which stipulated that all communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic liberation movements in the colonies. Notably some of the delegates opposed the idea of alliance with the bourgeoisie, and preferred giving support to communist movements in these countries instead. Their criticism was shared by the Indian revolutionary M.N. Roy , who attended as a delegate of the Communist Party of Mexico . The congress removed the term \xe2\x80\x98bourgeois-democratic\' in what became the 8th condition. [ 12 ] \n Many European socialist parties went through splits on the basis of the adhesion or not to the new International. The French Section of the Workers International (SFIO) thus broke away with the 1920 Tours Congress , leading to the creation of the new French Communist Party (initially called "French Section of the Communist International" - SFIC); the Communist Party of Spain was created in 1920, the Communist Party of Italy was created in 1921, the Belgian Communist Party in September 1921, etc. \n Third World Congress \n Writings from the Third Congress, held in June\xe2\x80\x93July 1921, talked about how the struggle could be transformed into "civil war" when the circumstances were favorable and "openly revolutionary uprisings". [ 13 ] The Fourth Congress, November 1922, at which Leon Trotsky played a prominent role, continued in this vein. [ 14 ] \n The Dungan commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, Magaza Masanchi , attended the Third Congress. [ 15 ] \n During this early period, known as the "First Period" in Comintern history, with the Bolshevik revolution under attack in the Russian Civil War and a wave of revolutions across Europe , the Comintern\'s priority was exporting the October Revolution. Some Communist Parties had secret military wings. On example is the M-Apparat of the Communist Party of Germany . Its purpose was to prepare for the civil war the Communists believed was impending in Germany, and to liquidate opponents and informers who might have infiltrated the party. There was also a paramilitary organization, the Rotfrontk\xc3\xa4mpferbund . [ 16 ] \n The Comintern was involved in the revolutions across Europe in this period, starting with the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. Several hundred agitators and financial aid were sent from the Soviet Union and Lenin was in regular contact with its leader, B\xc3\xa9la Kun . Soon an official "Terror Group of the Revolutionary Council of the Government" was formed, unofficially known as " Lenin Boys ". [ 17 ] The next attempt was the " March Action " in Germany in 1921, including an attempt to dynamite the express train from Halle to Leipzig. After this failed, the Communist Party of Germany expelled its former Chairman, Paul Levi , from the party for publicly criticising the March Action in a pamphlet, [ 18 ] which was ratified by the ECCI prior to the 3rd congress. [ 19 ] A new attempt was made at the time of the Ruhr Crisis in spring and then again in selected parts of Germany in the autumn of 1923. The Red Army was mobilized, ready to come to the aid of the planned insurrection. Resolute action by the German government cancelled the plans, except due to miscommunication in Hamburg, where 200-300 Communists attacked police stations but were quickly defeated. [ 20 ] In 1924 there was a failed coup in Estonia by the Estonian Communist Party . [ 21 ] \n In 1924, the Mongolian People\'s Revolutionary Party joined Comintern. [ 22 ] At first, in China both the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang were supported. After the definite break with Chiang Kai-shek in 1927, Stalin sent personal emissaries to help organize revolts which at this time failed. [ 23 ] \n Fifth to Seventh World Congresses \n The Second Period \n \n \n \n  \nThe Comintern membership card of Karl Kilbom \n \n \n Lenin died in 1924. 1925 signalled a shift from the immediate activity of world revolution towards a defence of the Soviet state. In that year, Joseph Stalin upheld the thesis of " socialism in one country ", detailed by Nikolai Bukharin in his brochure Can We Build Socialism in One Country in the Absence of the Victory of the West-European Proletariat? (April 1925). The position was finalized as the state policy after Stalin\'s January 1926 article On the Issues of Leninism . The perspective of a world revolution was dismissed after the failures of the Spartacist uprising in Germany and of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the reflux of all revolutionary movements in Europe, such as in Italy , where the fascist squadristi broke the strikes and quickly assumed power following the 1922 March on Rome ). This period, up to 1928, was known as the "Second Period", mirroring the shift in the USSR from war communism to the New Economic Policy . [ 24 ] \n At the 5th World Congress of the Comintern in July 1924, Zinoviev condemned Marxist philosopher Georg Luk\xc3\xa1cs \'s History and Class Consciousness , published in 1923 after his involvement in B\xc3\xa9la Kun \'s Hungarian Soviet Republic , and Karl Korsch \'s Marxism and Philosophy . [ citation needed ] Zinoviev himself was dismissed in 1926 after falling out of favor with Stalin, who already held considerable power by this time. Bukharin then led the Comintern for two years, until 1928 when he too fell out with Stalin. Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov headed the Comintern in 1934 and presided until its dissolution. \n Geoff Eley summed up the change in attitude at this time as follows: \n \n By the Fifth Comintern Congress in July 1924... the collapse of Communist support in Europe tightened the pressure for conformity. A new policy of "Bolshevization" was adopted, which dragooned the CPs toward stricter bureaucratic centralism. This flattened out the earlier diversity of radicalisms, welding them into a single approved model of Communist organization. Only then did the new parties retreat from broader Left arenas into their own belligerent world, even if many local cultures of broader cooperation persisted. Respect for Bolshevik achievements and defense of the Russian Revolution now transmuted into dependency on Moscow and belief in Soviet infallibility. Depressing cycles of "internal rectification" began, disgracing and expelling successive leaderships, so that by the later 1920s many founding Communists had gone. This process of coordination, in a hard-faced drive for uniformity, was finalized at the next Congress of the Third International in 1928. [ 25 ] \n \n The Third Period \n In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee began the so-called " Third Period ", which was to last until 1935. [ 26 ] The Comintern proclaimed that the capitalist system was entering the period of final collapse, and that as such, the correct stance for all Communist parties was that of a highly aggressive, militant, ultra-left line. In particular, the Comintern described all moderate left-wing parties as " social fascists ", and urged the Communists devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. With the rise of the Nazi movement in Germany after 1930, this stance became somewhat controversial with many, such as the Polish Communist historian Isaac Deutscher , criticizing the tactics of the Communist Party of Germany of treating the Social Democratic Party of Germany as the principal enemy. [ citation needed ] \n The 6th World Congress also revised the policy of united front in the colonial world. In 1927 the Kuomintang had turned on the Chinese Communists, which led to a review of the policy on forming alliances with the national bourgeoisie in the colonial countries. The congress did however make a differentiation between the character of the Chinese Kuomintang on one hand and the Indian Swarajist Party and the Egyptian Wafd Party on the other, considering the latter as an unreliable ally but not a direct enemy. The congress called on the Indian Communists to utilize the contradictions between the national bourgeoisie and the British imperialists. [ 27 ] \n Seventh World Congress and the Popular Front \n The seventh and last congress of the Comintern was held between July 25 and August 20, 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti , Wilhelm Pieck and Dmitry Manuilsky . [ 28 ] The congress officially endorsed the Popular Front against fascism. This policy argued that Communist Parties should seek to form a Popular Front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a United Front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern; in France and Spain in particular, it would have momentous consequences with L\xc3\xa9on Blum \'s 1936 election, which led to the Popular Front government . \n Stalin\'s purges of the 1930s affected Comintern activists living in both the USSR and overseas. At Stalin\'s direction, the Comintern was thoroughly infused with Soviet secret police and foreign intelligence operatives and informers working under Comintern guise. One of its leaders, Mikhail Trilisser , using the pseudonym \'Mikhail Aleksandrovich Moskvin\', was in fact chief of the foreign department of the Soviet OGPU (later, the NKVD ). At Stalin\'s orders, 133 out of 492 Comintern staff members became victims of the Great Purge . Several hundred German Communists and antifascists who had either fled from Nazi Germany or were convinced to relocate in the Soviet Union were liquidated, and more than a thousand were handed over to Germany. [ 29 ]  Fritz Platten died in a labor camp; the leaders of the Indian ( Virendranath Chattopadhyaya or Chatto), Korean, Mexican, Iranian and Turkish Communist parties were executed. Out of 11 Mongolian Communist Party leaders, only Khorloogiin Choibalsan survived. A great number of German Communists were handed over to Adolf Hitler . Leopold Trepper recalled these days: "In house, where the party activists of all the countries were living, no-one slept until 3 o\'clock in the morning.... Exactly 3 o\'clock the car lights began to be seen... we stayed near the window and waited [to find out], where the car stopped." [ 30 ] \n Dissolution \n At the start of World War II , the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention , arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, much like World War I had been. But when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position to one of active support for the Allies . On May 15, 1943, a declaration of the Executive Committee was sent out to all sections of the International, calling for the dissolution of Comintern. The declaration read: \n \n The historical role of the Communist International, organized in 1919 as a result of the political collapse of the overwhelming majority of the old pre-war workers\' parties, consisted in that it preserved the teachings of Marxism from vulgarisation and distortion by opportunist elements of the labor movement.... But long before the war it became increasingly clear that, to the extent that the internal as well as the international situation of individual countries became more complicated, the solution of the problems of the labor movement of each individual country through the medium of some international centre would meet with insuperable obstacles. \n \n Concretely, the declaration asked the member sections to approve: \n \n To dissolve the Communist International as a guiding centre of the international labor movement, releasing sections of the Communist International from the obligations ensuing from the constitution and decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International. \n \n After endorsements of the declaration were received from the member sections, the International was dissolved. [ 31 ] Messages between Tito and Dimitrov the Secretary-General in Moscow were intercepted and decrypted by the British GC&amp;CS ( Bletchley Park ) from 1943, though the volume of messages was not great (the first message from "Walter" [Tito] was intercepted on 21 April, though not decrypted until many months later). They showed the level of control exercised over him (Tito) by Moscow and continued with Dimitrov after June 1943, when the Comintern itself was dissolved. [ 32 ] \n Usually, it is asserted that the dissolution came about as Stalin wished to calm his World War II allies (particularly Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill ) and keep them from suspecting the Soviet Union of pursuing a policy of trying to foment revolution in other countries. [ 33 ] \n Successor organisations \n The International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was founded at roughly the same time that the Comintern was abolished in 1943, although its specific duties during the first several years of its existence are unknown. [ 34 ] \n In September 1947, following the June 1947 Paris Conference on Marshall Aid , Stalin gathered a grouping of key European communist parties and set up the Cominform , or Communist Information Bureau , often seen as a substitute to the Comintern. It was a network made up of the Communist parties of Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , France , Hungary , Italy , Poland , Romania , the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia (led by Josip Broz Tito , it was expelled in June 1948). The Cominform was dissolved in 1956, following Stalin\'s 1953 death and the XXth Congress of the CPSU . \n While the Communist parties of the world no longer had a formal international organization, they continued to maintain close relations with each other through a series of international forums. In the period directly after dissolution of Comintern, periodical meetings of Communist parties were held in Moscow . Moreover World Marxist Review , a joint periodical of the Communist parties, played an important role in coordinating the communist movement up to the break-up of the Socialist Bloc in 1989-1991. \n Comintern and Communist Party of China \n The complicated relationship between the Comintern and the Communist Party of China (CPC) is an important chapter in the history of Comintern. \n 1921 to 1927 \n The CPC was established in 1921 with the help of the Comintern. The CPC declared itself to be a branch of the Comintern. At that time, China had a large revolutionary party called the Chinese Nationalist Party ( Kuomintang ). Its leader, Dr. Sun Yatsen , frustrated by the refusal of aid for China from the democratic Western countries, quickly turned to the Soviet Union and the Comintern. Under the instruction of the Comintern, [ citation needed ] the CPC joined the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang also applied for membership in the Comintern, but was not accepted since it was essentially considered to be an anti-colonialist bourgeois political party and not a true Marxist vehicle. Sun Yatsen\xe2\x80\x99s successor, Chiang Kai-shek , was once elected as an honorary member of the standing committee of the Comintern. [ citation needed ] \n The Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Joseph Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin followed a practical policy, ignoring communist ideology. He told the Chinese Communist Party to stop whining about the lower classes and follow the Kuomintang \'s orders. Stalin, like Vladimir Lenin , believed that the KMT bourgeoisie would defeat the western imperialists in China and complete the revolution. Trotsky wanted the Communist party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and opposed the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. [ 35 ] Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang\'s right wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 1927 by massacring the Communist party in Shanghai midway in the Northern Expedition. [ 36 ]  [ 37 ] \n 1927 to 1935 \n After the success of the joint revolution of the Kuomintang and CPC in reuniting China under a single government, they split over their ideological differences. The Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek ultimately became an anti-Communist force. The Comintern instructed the Communists to initiate urban riots, but all failed. [ citation needed ] A group of \xe2\x80\x9cnative Communists\xe2\x80\x9d, such as Mao Zedong , used peasant riots to establish the Soviet Republic of China in remote mountain villages. The Comintern sent a German Communist, Otto Braun , as the CPC\'s military adviser, who became the CPC\'s de facto military commander later. [ citation needed ] Zhou Enlai , once the Comintern\'s favorite, [ citation needed ] was the chairman of the Military Committee of the CPC. After being besieged by Chiang Kai-shek\xe2\x80\x99s Nationalist army, the Chinese Red Army had to escape to try to find a new base - this came to be known as the Long March (1934\xe2\x80\x931935). \n 1935 to 1942 \n During the Long March, the CPC party leadership re-examined its policy in Zunyi (January 1935). Mao Zedong blamed the CPC\'s failure to ignite a revolution on their decision to blindly follow the Comintern\'s instructions, which did not take into account the reality of Chinese conditions. During the heated debate, Zhou Enlai unexpectedly accepted the criticism and sided with Mao. Otto Braun was dismissed from his position as the CPC\'s military commander. \n After they resettled in Yanan , the native Chinese Communists, such as Mao and Zhu De , became the real powers in the CPC rather than the foreign Communists supplied by the Comintern. Those Chinese Communists who were loyal to the Comintern, such as a group called the 28 Bolsheviks , fell from all of the most important positions within the CPC. Zhou Enlai became an assistant to Mao in political affairs, such as the pursuit of the United Front and diplomacy. By this time, the Comintern and the Soviet Union could no longer control the CPC. The Comintern continued to give advice, but much of it was simply ignored. The CPC was now a truly Chinese entity, much as the Bolshevik Party had been a truly Russian one. \n An exception to this rule was the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army , organized by the Manchuria branch of the CPC in 1932. Geographically separated from the CPC headquarters in Yenan , this guerrilla army did not report directly to the CPC center, but was still led and supported by the Soviet Union under the guise of the Comintern until it was defeated by a Japanese occupation force and fled to the Soviet Union in 1942. \n Comintern-sponsored international organisations \n Several international organizations were sponsored by the Comintern in this period: \n \n Communist Youth International (1919\xe2\x80\x931943) \n Red International of Labour Unions (Profintern - formed 1920) \n Communist Women\'s International (formed 1920) \n International Red Aid (MOPR - formed 1922) \n Red Peasant International (Krestintern - formed 1923) \n Red Sports International (Sportintern) \n International of the Proletarian Freethinkers (1925\xe2\x80\x931933) \n League against Imperialism (formed 1927) \n \n World congresses and plenums of Comintern \n Delegate figures are voting plus consultative.

The term "purge" has taken on very negative connotations, because of the Great Purge of the 1930s. In the early 1920s, however, the term was more ambiguous. See J. Arch Getty Origins of the Great Purges: The Soviet Communist Party Reconsidered, 1933-1938 p.41 for discussion of the ambiguities in the term, including its use in the 1920 Comintern resolution. \n ^  M.V.S.

Marx , also known as the father of communism, spent most of his life in exile in Great Britain and France . He wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848, which later served as the inspiration for the formation of the Communist Party. Communism is also known as &quot;Marxism.&quot; Marx believed that a truly utopian society must be classless and stateless. (It should be noted that Marx died well before any of his theories were put to the test.) Marx\'s main idea was simple: Free the lower class from poverty and give the poor a fighting chance. How he believed it should be accomplished, however, was another story. In order to liberate the lower class, Marx believed that the government would have to control all means of production so that no one could outdo anyone else by making more money. Unfortunately, that proves to this day to be more difficult than he might have realized. Marx described three necessary phases toward achieving his idea of utopia. Phase 1: A revolution must take place in order to overthrow the existing government. Marx emphasized the nee\xc2\xadd for total destruction of the existing system in order to move on to Phase 2. Phase 2: A dictator or elite leader (or leaders) must gain absolute control over the proletariat. During this phase, the new government exerts absolute control over the common citizen\'s personal choices -- including his or her education, religion, employment and even marriage . Collectivization of property and wealth must also take place. Phase 3: Achievement of utopia. This phase has never been attained because it requires that all non-communists be destroyed in order for the Communist Party to achieve supreme equality. In a Marxist utopia, everyone would happily share property and wealth, free from the restrictions that class-based systems require. The government would control all means of production so that the one-class system would remain constant, with no possibility of any middle class citizens rising back to the top. (You can see the full text of the manifesto at this Web site.) Marx also detailed the 10 essential tenets of communism, namely: Central banking system Government controlled education Government controlled labor Government ownership of transportation and communication vehicles Government ownership of agricultural means and factories Total abolition of private property Property rights confiscation Heavy income tax on everyone Elimination of rights of inheritance Regional planning In the communist society that Marx described, the government has supreme authority through its total control of land and means of production. Because the government distributes land and property among the people, communism sets a standard of equality -- both economically and socially -- among its followers. \xc2\xadThe system seems to work in theory, but how did communism work in practice? Read on to learn about the rise of the first communist nation. \t \n \n\t Communism-related Terms \n\t\t \n Socialism : A system that advocates the state\'s ownership of land, industry and capital.

His comprehensive writings on the subject laid the foundation for later political leaders, notably V. I. Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, to impose communism on more than twenty countries. \n      \n      \n       Marx was born in Trier, Prussia (now Germany), in 1818. He studied philosophy at universities in Bonn and Berlin, earning his doctorate in Jena at the age of twenty-three. His early radicalism, first as a member of the Young Hegelians, then as editor of a newspaper suppressed for its derisive social and political content, preempted any career aspirations in academia and forced him to flee to Paris in 1843. It was then that Marx cemented his lifelong friendship with Friedrich Engels. In 1849 Marx moved to London, where he continued to study and write, drawing heavily on works by David Ricardo and Adam Smith . Marx died in London in 1883 in somewhat impoverished surroundings. Most of his adult life, he relied on Engels for financial support. \n      \n      \n       At the request of the Communist League, Marx and Engels coauthored their most famous work, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Communist Manifesto,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1848. A call to arms for the proletariat\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cWorkers of the world, unite!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the manifesto set down the principles on which communism was to evolve. Marx held that history was a series of class struggles between owners of capital (capitalists) and workers (the proletariat). As wealth became more concentrated in the hands of a few capitalists, he thought, the ranks of an increasingly dissatisfied proletariat would swell, leading to bloody revolution and eventually a classless society. \n      \n      \n       It has become fashionable to think that Karl Marx was not mainly an economist but instead integrated various disciplines\xe2\x80\x94economics, sociology, political science, history, and so on\xe2\x80\x94into his philosophy. But Mark Blaug, a noted historian of economic thought, points out that Marx wrote \xe2\x80\x9cno more than a dozen pages on the concept of social class, the theory of the state, and the materialist conception of history\xe2\x80\x9d while he wrote \xe2\x80\x9cliterally 10,000 pages on economics pure and simple.\xe2\x80\x9d 1 \n      \n      \n       According to Marx, capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction. Communism was the inevitable end to the process of evolution begun with feudalism and passing through capitalism and socialism . Marx wrote extensively about the economic causes of this process in Capital . Volume one was published in 1867 and the later two volumes, heavily edited by Engels, were published posthumously in 1885 and 1894. \n      \n      \n       The labor theory of value, decreasing rates of profit, and increasing concentration of wealth are key components of Marx\xe2\x80\x99s economic thought. His comprehensive treatment of capitalism stands in stark contrast, however, to his treatment of socialism and communism, which Marx handled only superficially. He declined to speculate on how those two economic systems would operate. \n      \n      About the Author \n      \n       Janet Beales Kaidantzis was assistant editor of The Fortune Encyclopedia of Economics. \n      \n      \n      \n       Selected Works \n       \n       1848. \xe2\x80\x9cManifesto of the Communist Party.\xe2\x80\x9d Reprinted in Marx: The Revolutions of 1848.

Says Soros: Robs from rich western countries, and uses his profits to rob even more savagely from the East, under the cloak of &quot;philanthropy.&quot; His goal is to loot wherever and however he can. Soros has been called the master manipulator of &quot;hit-and-run capitalism.&quot; Says he has attacked the currencies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Mexico. Says George Soros is part of a tightly knit financial mafia and connected to the Rothschilds. Says Soros admitted in a radio interview that his father gave him Nazi credentials in Hungary during the war, and he looted wealthy Jewish estates. Further research showed that this operation was probably run by the SS. Says Soros worked with Communists in Poland and shows his ties to Henry Kissinger. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 11.01.96 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The Man Who Broke the Bank of England \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  Soros caused the 4Q'08 US financial collapse (with the help of Barney Frank and Chris Dodd ). The precise timing of the global bank run - just weeks before the 2008 election - was the tip off.

It publishes a quarterly magazine, Revolutionary Perspectives and distributes an agitational broadsheet Aurora . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n \n 1.1 Growth \n 1.2 Merger \n \n \n 2 See also \n 3 References \n 4 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n The group was founded in the mid-1970s with the union of Workers Voice , based in Liverpool , and Revolutionary Perspectives , a group based in the North of england and Scotland some of whose members had previously been active in Solidarity . Both groups were influenced by German left communism and in particular the KAPD. Both published articles on the German Revolution. Revolutionary Perspectives also translated Otto Ruhle\'s "From the Bourgeois to the Proletarian Revolution" into English. By 1975 the two groups coalesced broadly around the positions of the KAPD\'s "Essen Tendency". Both groups had also taken part in international conferences sponsored by the French group R\xc3\xa9volution Internationale with the British group World Revolution . These two groups formed the International Communist Current , but the Workers Voice group denounced this as "counter-revolutionary" over its defence of the October Revolution and its position on the period of transition. Revolutionary Perspectives had tried to mediate between Workers Voice and World Revolution but was now forced to choose. As World Revolution had already rejected its draft platform and it had disagreements on several other positions, most notably the tendency of the rate of profit to fall Revolutionary Perspectives chose to unite with Workers Voice. \n [ edit ] Growth \n For a year the organisation grew, publishing ten issues (the journals Workers Voice and Revolutionary Perspectives) as well as distributing thousands of leaflets at factory gates and establishing groups in several factories. However by the end of 1976 it was clear that the wave of working class struggle which had led to the rebirth of left communism in Britain was over. The Liverpool section now began to retreat into local activity and, without issuing a document or giving any political explanation, abandoned joint political work and dissolved. This loss was followed in 1977 by the demand of the Aberdeen section that the CWO should now join the International Communist Current , which they now claimed was the communist movement. Although the majority were prepared to discuss this the Aberdeen section left within a month (it would split from the ICC within a few years to form the Communist Bulletin Group ). \n [ edit ] Merger \n In 1977 the CWO majority adhered to the international conferences initiated by the Internationalist Communist Party (Battaglia Comunista) and in the course of them became convinced by them that the positions the latter had defended since 1943 were the best product of the left communist tradition. The two organisations formed the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party in 1983. This organisation was eventually joined by left communist groups in France, Canada, the USA and Germany. In recognition of this expansion it moved towards a closer coordination of its activities in 2009 with the formation of the Internationalist Communist Tendency . \n [ edit ] See also \n \n An earlier British organisation with the same name in the late sixties was a Maoist group which merged with the Irish Communist Organisation in 1971.

War Communism was\r\nintroduced by Lenin to combat the economic problems brought on by the civil war \r\nin Russia. It was a combination of emergency measures and socialist dogma. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n One of the first measures of War\r\nCommunism was the nationalisation of land . Banks and shipping were also\r\nnationalised and foreign trade was declared a state monopoly. This was the\r\nresponse when Lenin realised that the Bolsheviks were simply unprepared to take\r\nover the whole economic system of Russia. Lenin stressed the importance of the\r\nworkers showing discipline and a will to work hard if the revolution was to\r\nsurvive. There were those in the Bolshevik hierarchy who wanted factory managers\r\nremoved and the workers to take over the factories for themselves but on behalf\r\nof the people. It was felt that the workers would work better if they believed\r\nthey were working for a cause as opposed to a system that made some rich but\r\nmany poor. The civil war had made many in the Bolsheviks even more class\r\nantagonistic, as there were many of the old guard who were fighting to destroy\r\nthe Bolsheviks. \r\n On June 28th, 1918, a decree\r\nwas passed that ended all forms of private capitalism. Many large factories were\r\ntaken over by the state and on November 29th, 1920, any\r\nfactory/industry that employed over 10 workers was nationalised. \r\n War Communism also took control of the\r\ndistribution of food. The Food Commissariat was set up to carry out this task.\r\nAll co-operatives were fused together under this Commissariat. \r\n War Communism had six principles: \r\n\r\n \r\n 1) Production should be run by the state. Private ownership should be kept\r\nto the minimum. Private houses were to be confiscated by the state. \r\n 2) State control was to be granted over the labour of every citizen. Once a\r\nmilitary army had served its purpose, it would become a labour army. \r\n 3) The state should produce everything in its own undertakings. The state\r\ntried to control the activities of millions of peasants. \r\n 4) Extreme centralisation was introduced. The economic life of the area\r\ncontrolled by the Bolsheviks was put into the hands of just a few organisations.\r\nThe most important one was the Supreme Economic Council. This had the right to\r\nconfiscate and requisition. The speciality of the SEC was the management of\r\nindustry. Over 40 head departments (known as glavki) were set up to accomplish\r\nthis. One glavki could be responsible for thousands of factories. This\r\nfrequently resulted in chronic inefficiency. The Commissariat of Transport\r\ncontrolled the railways. The Commissariat of Agriculture controlled what the\r\npeasants did. \r\n 5) The state attempted to become the soul distributor as well as the sole\r\nproducer. The Commissariats took what they needed to meet demands. The people\r\nwere divided into four categories \x96 manual workers in harmful trades, workers\r\nwho performed hard physical labour, workers in light tasks/housewives and\r\nprofessional people. Food was distributed on a 4:3:2:1 ratio. Though the manual\r\nclass was the favoured class, it still received little food. Many in the\r\nprofessional class simply starved. It is believed that about 0% of all food\r\nconsumed came from an illegal source. On July 20th 1918, the\r\nBolsheviks decided that all surplus food had to be surrendered to the state.\r\nThis led to an increase in the supply of grain to the state. From 1917 to 1928,\r\nabout \xbe million ton was collected by the state. In 1920 to 1921, this had risen\r\nto about 6 million tons. However, the policy of having to hand over surplus food\r\ncaused huge resentment in the countryside, especially as Lenin had promised\r\n\x93all land to the people\x94 pre-November 1917. While the peasants had the land,\r\nthey had not been made aware that they would have to hand over any extra food\r\nthey produced from their land. Even the extra could not meet demand. In 1933, 25\r\nmillion tons of grain was collected and this only just met demand. \r\n 6) War Communism attempted to abolish money as a means of exchange. The\r\nBolsheviks wanted to go over to a system of a natural economy in which all\r\ntransactions were carried out in kind. Effectively, bartering would be\r\nintroduced. By 1921, the value of the rouble had dropped massively and inflation\r\nhad markedly increased. The government\x92s revenue raising ability was\r\nchronically poor, as it had abolished most taxes. The only tax allowed was the\r\n\x91Extraordinary Revolutionary Tax\x92, which was targeted at the rich and not\r\nthe workers. \r\n War Communism was a disaster. In all\r\nareas, the economic strength of Russia fell below the 1914 level. Peasant\r\nfarmers only grew for themselves, as they knew that any extra would be taken by\r\nthe state. Therefore, the industrial cities were starved of food despite the\r\nintroduction of the 4:3:2:1 ratio. A bad harvest could be disastrous for the\r\ncountryside \x96 and even worse for cities. Malnutrition was common, as was\r\ndisease. Those in the cities believed that their only hope was to move out to\r\nthe countryside and grow food for themselves. Between 1916 and 1920, the cities\r\nof northern and central Russia lost 33% of their population to the countryside.\r\nUnder War Communism, the number of those working in the factories and mines\r\ndropped by 50%. \r\n In the cities, private trade was\r\nillegal, but more people were engaged in this than at any other time in\r\nRussia\x92s history. Large factories became paralysed through lack of fuel and\r\nskilled labour. \r\n Small factories were in 1920 producing\r\njust 43% of their 1913 total. Large factories were producing 18% of their 1913\r\nfigure. Coal production was at 27% of its 1913 figure in 1920. With little food\r\nto nourish them, it could not be expected that the workers could work\r\neffectively. By 1920, the average worker had a productivity rate that was 44%\r\nless than the 1913 figure. \r\n Even if anything of value could be\r\nproduced, the ability to move it around Russia was limited. By the end of 1918,\r\nRussia\x92s rail system was in chaos. \r\n In the countryside, most land was used\r\nfor the growth of food. Crops such as flax and cotton simply were not grown.\r\nBetween 1913 and 1920, there was an 87% drop in the number of acres given over\r\nto cotton production. Therefore, those factories producing cotton related\r\nproducts were starved of the most basic commodity they needed. \r\n How did the people react to War\r\nCommunism? Within the cities, many were convinced that their leaders were right\r\nand the failings being experienced were the fault of the Whites and\r\ninternational capitalists. There were few strikes during War Communism \x96\r\nthough Lenin was quick to have anyone arrested who seemed to be a potential\r\ncause of trouble. Those in Bolshevik held territory were also keen to see a\r\nBolshevik victory in the civil war, so they were prepared to do what was\r\nnecessary. The alternate \x96 a White victory \x96 was unthinkable. \r\n Also the Bolshevik hierarchy could blame\r\na lot of Russia\x92s troubles on the Whites as they controlled the areas, which\r\nwould have supplied the factories with produce. The Urals provided Petrograd and\r\nTula with coal and iron for their factories. The Urals was completely separated\r\nfrom Bolshevik Russia from the spring of 1918 to November 1919. Oil fields were\r\nin the hands of the Whites. Also the Bolshevik\x92s Red Army took up the majority\r\nof whatever supplies there were in their fight against the Whites. \r\n No foreign country was prepared to trade\r\nwith the Russia controlled by the Bolsheviks, so foreign trade ceased to exist.\r\nBetween 1918 and November 1920, the Allies formally blockaded Russia. \r\n The harshness of War Communism could be justified\r\nwhilst the civil war was going on. When it had finished, there could be no such\r\njustification. There were violent rebellions in Tambov and in Siberia. The\r\nsailors in Kronstadt mutinied. Lenin faced the very real risk of an uprising of\r\nworkers and peasants and he needed to show the type of approach to the problem\r\nthat the tsarist regime was incapable of doing. In February 1921, Lenin had\r\ndecided to do away with War Communism and replace it with a completely different\r\nsystem \x96 the New Economic Policy . This was put to the 10th Party\r\nConference in March and accepted. War Communism was swept away. During War\r\nCommunism, the people had no incentive to produce as money had been abolished.\r\nThey did what needed to be done because of the civil war, but once this had\r\nended Lenin could not use it as an excuse any longer.  \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n   Related Pages  World War One, WW1 The Purges in the USSR Sergei Kirov The Red Terror Felix Dzerzhinsky November Revolution 1917 March Revolution 1917 The Cheka The Revolt of the Spanish Netherlands Nicolai Bukharin  \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   History Learning Site &gt;  Modern World History &gt;  Russia 1900 to 1939 &gt;  War Communism \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n   Online College and University Degree Guide \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   \r\n   If you have any enquiries or notice any problems please contact me at\r\n   enquiries@historylearningsite.co.uk \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   About the Author | \r\n   Terms of Use | \r\n   Privacy Policy \r\n   \r\n  \r\n   &copy; 2000-2013 HistoryLearningSite.co.uk \r\n   \r\n   Back to top'

It has since been recognized as one of the world\'s most influential political manuscripts. [ 1 ] Commissioned by the Communist League , it laid out the League\'s purposes and program. It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and present) and the problems of capitalism, rather than a prediction of communism\'s potential future forms. [ 2 ] \n The book contains Marx and Engels\' theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". [ 3 ] It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism , and then eventually communism . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Authorship \n 2 Textual history \n 3 Contents \n \n 3.1 Introduction \n 3.2 I.

In July 1847, Engels was elected into the Communist League, where he was assigned to draw up a catechism. This became the Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith. The draft contained almost two dozen questions that helped express the ideas of both Engels and Karl Marx at the time. In October 1847, Engels composed his second draft for the Communist League entitled The Principles of Communism. The text remained unpublished until 1914, despite its basis for The Manifesto. From Engels\'s drafts Marx was able to write, once commissioned by the Communist League, The Communist Manifesto, where he combined more of his ideas along with Engels\'s drafts and work, The Condition of the Working Class in England. [ 4 ] \n Although the names of both Engels and Karl Marx appear on the title page alongside the "persistent assumption of joint-authorship", Engels, in the preface introduction to the 1883 German edition of the Manifesto, said that the Manifesto was "essentially Marx\'s work" and that "the basic thought... belongs solely and exclusively to Marx." [ 5 ] \n Engels wrote after Marx\'s death, \n \n "I cannot deny that both before and during my forty years\' collaboration with Marx I had a certain independent share in laying the foundations of the theory, but the greater part of its leading basic principles belongs to Marx....Marx was a genius; we others were at best talented. Without him the theory would not be by far what it is today. It therefore rightly bears his name." [ 6 ] \n \n Despite Engels\'s modesty in these two quotations, in fact he made major contributions to the Manifesto, starting with the suggestion to abandon "the form of a catechism and entitle it the Communist Manifesto ." Moreover, Engels joined Marx in Brussels for the writing of the Manifesto. There is no evidence of what his contributions to the final writing were, but the Manifesto bears the stamp of Marx\'s more rhetorical writing style. Nevertheless, it seems clear that Engels\'s contributions justify his name\'s appearance on the title page after Marx\'s. [ 7 ] \n Textual history \n The Communist Manifesto was first published (in German) in London by a group of German political refugees in 1848. It was also serialised at around the same time in a German-language London newspaper, the Deutsche Londoner Zeitung . [ 8 ] The first English translation was produced by Helen Macfarlane in 1850, and the book was first published in the United States by Stephen Pearl Andrews . [ 9 ] The Manifesto went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 French edition, and the 1888 English edition. The 1910 edition , translated by Samuel Moore with the assistance of Engels, has been the most commonly used English text since. [ 10 ] \n However, some recent English editions, such as Phil Gasper\'s annotated "road map" ( Haymarket Books , 2006), have used a slightly modified text in response to criticisms of the Moore translation made by Hal Draper in his 1994 history of the Manifesto , The Adventures of the "Communist Manifesto" (Center for Socialist History, 1994). \n In late 2010, Red Quill Books announced the release of a modern, illustrated "comic book" version of the Communist Manifesto in four parts. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] \n Contents \n The Manifesto is divided into an introduction, three substantive sections, and a conclusion. \n Introduction \n The preamble to the main text of the Manifesto states that the continent of Europe fears the "spectre of communism", and the powers of old Europe are uniting in "a holy alliance [intended to] exorcise this spectre". Marx refers here to not only the houses of power and landed gentry of old Europe\xe2\x80\x94the bourgeoisie\xe2\x80\x94but diverse factions such as the papacy and the emerging corporate world as well. [ 13 ] Marx declares that "It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself". [ 13 ] \n I. Bourgeois and Proletarians \n The first chapter of the Manifesto , "Bourgeois and Proletarians", examines the Marxist conception of history, with the initial idea asserting that "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". [ 3 ] It goes on to say that in capitalism, the working class, proletariat , are fighting in the class struggle against the owners of the means of production, the bourgeois , and that past class struggle ended either with revolution that restructured society, or "common ruin of the contending classes". [ 3 ] \n It continues by adding that the bourgeois exploits the proletariat through the "constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions". [ 3 ] \n The Manifesto explains that the reason the bourgeois exist and exploit the proletariat with low wages is private property , "the accumulation of wealth in private hands, the formation and increase of capital", [ 3 ] and that competition amongst the proletariat creates wage-labour, which rests entirely on the competition among the workers. [ 3 ] \n This section further explains that the proletarians will eventually rise to power through class struggle: the bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for its manual labour and cheap wages, ultimately to create profit for the bourgeois; the proletariat rise to power through revolution against the bourgeoisie such as riots or creation of unions. The Communist Manifesto states that while there is still class struggle amongst society, capitalism will be overthrown by the proletariat only to start again in the near future; ultimately communism is the key to class equality amongst the citizens of Europe. \n II. Proletarians and Communists \n The second section, "Proletarians and Communists", starts by stating the relationship of conscious communists to the rest of the working class, declaring that they will not form a separate party that opposes other working-class parties, will express the interests and general will of the proletariat as a whole, and will distinguish themselves from other working-class parties by always expressing the common interest of the entire proletariat independently of all nationalities and representing the interests of the movement as a whole. [ 14 ] \n The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, such as the claim that communists advocate " free love ", and the claim that people will not perform labor in a communist society because they have no incentive to work. [ 14 ] The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands: \n \n \n Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes. \n A heavy progressive or graduated income tax. \n Abolition of all right of inheritance . \n Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels . \n Centralisation of credit in the hands of the State , by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly. \n Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State. \n Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan . \n Equal liability of all to labour. Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture. \n Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equitable distribution of the population over the country. \n Free education for all children in public schools . Abolition of children\'s factory labour in its present form and combination of education with industrial production. [ 15 ] \n \n \n The implementation of these policies would, as believed by Marx and Engels, be a precursor to the stateless and classless society . [ 14 ] In a controversial passage they suggested that the "proletariat" might in competition with the bourgeoisie be compelled to organise as a class, form a revolution, make itself a ruling class, sweep away the old conditions of production, and in that step have abolished its own supremacy as a class. [ 14 ] This account of the transition from socialism to communism was criticised particularly during and after the Soviet era. \n III. Socialist and Communist Literature \n The third section, "Socialist and Communist Literature," distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time the Manifesto was written. [ 16 ] While the degree of reproach of Marx and Engels toward rival perspectives varies, all are dismissed for advocating reformism and failing to recognise the preeminent role of the working class. \n IV. Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties \n The concluding section, "Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties", briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth century such as France, Switzerland, Poland, and Germany, and declares that Germany "is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution", [ 17 ] and predicts that a world revolution will soon follow. [ 17 ] It then ends by declaring an alliance with the social democrats , boldly supporting other communist revolutions, and calling the proletarians to action, ending with the rallying cry of communism, " Workers of the world, unite! ". [ 17 ] \n Reception \n Praise \n The revolutionary wave throughout Europe in 1848 , which began in France in February and immediately spread to most of Europe and parts of Latin America, [ 18 ] owed nothing to The Communist Manifesto , but within a year the revolutions collapsed. [ 19 ] Subsequently, traditional authorities found in The Communist Manifesto and its contents a good excuse for action against its authors. As a consequence, Marx and his wife were arrested and expelled from Belgium , the German daily newspaper published by Marx in Cologne between 1 June 1848 and 19 May 1849, Neue Rheinische Zeitung: Organ der Demokratie , was suppressed, [ 20 ]  [ 21 ] and Marx himself was expelled from Germany and France, and, in August 1849 he sought refuge in London. [ 22 ]  [ 23 ]  [ 24 ] \n A number of 21st century writers have commented on The Communist Manifesto\' s continuing relevance. Academic John Raines, writing in 2002, noted that "In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall. Read The Communist Manifesto , written more than one hundred and fifty years ago, and you will discover that Marx foresaw it all." [ 25 ] Writing in 2003, the English Marxist Chris Harman described the work, stating that: \n \n There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where its going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today\'s world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and "overproduction" on the other. There are passages that could have come from the most recent writings on globalisation. [ 26 ] \n \n The continued relevance of the Marxist theories found within the text has also been supported by the Marxist academic Alex Callinicos , editor of International Socialism , who stated that "This is indeed a manifesto for the 21st century." [ 27 ] \n Writing in The London Evening Standard on 23 April, Andrew Neather cited Verso Books \' 2012 re-edition of The Communist Manifesto , with an introduction by Eric Hobsbawm , as part of a resurgence of left-wing-themed ideas which includes the publication of Owen Jones \' best-selling Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class , and Jason Barker \'s documentary Marx Reloaded . [ 28 ] \n Criticism \n Revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist Eduard Bernstein distinguished between early Marxism as being its "immature" form: as exemplified by The Communist Manifesto written by Marx and Engels in their youth, that he opposed for what he regarded as its violent Blanquist tendencies; and later Marxism as being its "mature" form that he supported. [ 29 ] This "mature" form of Marxism refers to Marx in his later life acknowledging that socialism could be achieved through peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies. [ 30 ] \n Bernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working-class claimed in the Communist Manifesto did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that the working-class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle-class was not disappearing, in his work Theories of Surplus Value (1863). However due to the popularity of the Communist Manifesto and the obscurity of Theories of Surplus Value , Marx\'s acknowledgement of this error is not well known.

S'Communism vs Socialism - Difference and Comparison | Diffen \n   \n   \n    \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  \n   Communism vs Socialism \n     \n    Diffen \xe2\x80\xba      \n      Economics \n        \n     \n   In a way, communism is an extreme form of socialism . Many countries have dominant socialist political parties but very few are truly communist. In fact, most countries - including staunch capitalist bastions like the U.S. and U.K. - have government programs that borrow from socialist principles. " Socialism " is sometimes used interchangeably with " communism " but the two philosophies have some stark differences. Most notably, while communism is a political system, socialism is primarily an economic system that can exist in various forms under a wide range of political systems.\n \n\t\t Comparison chart \n   \n    \n     \n      \n      Communism \n      Socialism \n     \n    \n    Philosophy:     From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Free-access to the articles of consumption is made possible by advances in technology that allow for super-abundance \n     From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution. Emphasis on profit being distributed among the society or workforce in addition to receiving a wage. \n     Definition:     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the community or state \n     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of most property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the workers \n     Political System:     No leader, directed directly by the people. This has never been actually practiced, and has just used a one-party system. \n     Multiple parties, but the ruling party usually goes by the name &quot;Socialist&quot;. \n     Social Structure:     All class distinctions are eliminated. \n     Class distinctions are diminished \n     Economic System:     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given equal shares of the benefits derived from labor. All means of production are controlled by the state. \n     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given somewhat equal shares of the benefits derived from labor, but people can earn more if they work harder. Means of production are controlled by the workers themselves. \n     Free Choice:     In real communism, where a leader does not exist, everything is chosen freely.In those that have been practiced though, all choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are controlled by the state. \n     All choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are up to the individual. All health care and education is provided free to everybody \n     Ideas:     Human societies have always been divided into warring classes. The Industrial Revolution has enriched the wealthy and impoverished the poor. The workers must overthrow the bourgeois. \n     All people should be given an equal opportunity to succeed. Workers should have most say in their factory\'s management. The free market suffers from problems like tragedy of the commons. Government regulation is necessary. \n     Private Property:     Abolished \n     two kinds of property, private property, such as land, houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. Public property, factories, and means of production owned by the state but with worker control \n     Religion:     Abolished. \n     freedom of religion \n     Economic Coordination:     Government controls all business, as well as Business decisions. \n     Planned-Socialism relies principally on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralized or decentralized. Market-socialism relies on markets for allocating capital to different socially-owned enterprises. \n     Discrimination:     In theory, all members of the state are considered equal \n     The people are considered equal, laws are made when necessary to protect people from discrimination \n     Political Movements:     Leninism, Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, Left-Communism \n     Democratic Socialism, Communism, Libertarian Socialism, Anarchism, Syndicalism \n     Key elements:     An enhanced form of the principle of &quot;Production for use&quot;. \n     Economic activity and production especially are adjusted to meet human needs and economic demands. &quot;Production for use&quot;: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. \n     Ownership structure:     The means of production are commonly-owned, meaning no entity or individual owns productive property. Importance is ascribed to &quot;usership&quot; over &quot;ownership&quot;. \n     The means of production are socially-owned with the surplus value produced accruing to either all of society (in Public-ownership models) or to all the employee-members of the enterprise (in Cooperative-ownership models). \n     Key Proponents:     Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky \n     Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Emma Goldman \n     Means of control:     Proletariat engages in violent rebellion. \n     Proletariat engages in taking charge of the factories and means of production. \n     Variations:     Include Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism \n     libertarian-socialism, and anarcho-socialism, anarcho-syndicalism \n     Way of Change:     Government in a Communist-state is the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by government can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     Workers in a Socialist-state are the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by the workers can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     \n\n\n \n\t\t Contents \n \n 1 Economic differences between socialists and communists \n 2 Political differences \n 3 Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n 4 Related Articles \n 5 References \n   Economic differences between socialists and communists \n In a Socialist economy, the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy. On the other hand, in a communist society, there is no centralized government - there is a collective ownership of property and the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.\n For a Capitalist society to transition, the first step is Socialism. From a capitalist system, it is easier to achieve the Socialist ideal where production is distributed according to people\'s deeds (quantity and quality of work done). For Communism (to distribute production according to needs ), it is necessary to first have production so high that there is enough for everyone\'s needs. In an ideal Communist society, people work not because they have to but because they want to and out of a sense of responsibility .\n \n  Political differences \n Socialism rejects a class-based society. But socialists believe that it is possible to make the transition from capitalism to socialism without a basic change in the character of the state. They hold this view because they do not think of the capitalist state as essentially an institution for the dictatorship of the capitalist class, but rather as a perfectly good piece of machinery which can be used in the interest of whichever class gets command of it. No need, then, for the working class in power to smash the old capitalist state apparatus and set up its own\xe2\x80\x94the march to socialism can be made step by step within the framework of the democratic forms of the capitalist state. Socialism is primarily an economic system so it exists in varying degrees and forms in a wide variety of political systems.\n On the other hand, communists believe that as soon as the working class and its allies are in a position to do so they must make a basic change in the character of the state; they must replace capitalist dictatorship over the working class with workers\xe2\x80\x99 dictatorship over the capitalist class as the first step in the process by which the existence of capitalists as a class (but not as individuals) is ended and a classless society is eventually ushered in.\n \n  Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n This is a very opinionated video that explains the differences between communism and socialism.\n \n \n  Related Articles \n Capitalism vs Socialism \n Liberal vs Conservative \n Democrat vs Republican \n Communism vs Fascism \n Communism vs Democracy \n \n  References \n http://www.marxmail.org/faq/socialism_and_communism.htm \n http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/faq/commievssoc.html \n http://www.romm.org/soc_com.html \n http://www.pww.org/past-weeks-1999/Socialism%20and%20communism.htm \n \n   \n    \n         \n     Comments: Communism vs Socialism \n     Comment anonymously \n      Anonymous comments     \n     Socialists has been in america since the late 1800s and has played an important role in organizing strikes and unions in the country. With out them there may have been a lot more starving people during the great depression \n     165.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.67 on 2013-04-17 12:24:25 \n         \n     to the guy who said why socialism aka communism doesn\'t work.\r\n\r\nSocialism and communism are not at all the same thing as they differ in many ways. A socialism has never existed. as a true socialism is one that the government fully regulates major companies and still lets there be private industry still alive to allow growth as well as the stability of a well controlled industry \n     209.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.251 on 2013-03-20 14:48:58 \n         \n     All of you ignore the basic instincts of human nature. If any of you would understand that, you would also understand why socialism aka communism simply does not work and is simply an utopia. Acording to marx, capitalism unevitably will lead to socialism, and socialism to communism. Is like fore play and sex, one lead to the other. At least thats how it was suposed to be through marx\'s eyes. Yes, there is a socialist tendency in this country, is been here ever since the 50\'s if I\'m not mistaken. Just take a look back and see the violent manifestations in the past of socialist suporters in this country. Marx also promotes that. When it became a big deal to identifie oneself as socialist in this country, and the socialist party went under ground, its members went under the umbrela of the democratic party, and were forced to change their estrategy. now they are tring to indoctrinate kids in schools and universities whith out them even noticing what they are being indoctrinated with. For all of you that want to know about marxism, you need to get your hands on marx and engels books and read them. Then see how such line of thinking have worked in the past for socialist and communist countries and how is working for europe, which is on the verge of total bankrupcy and economic desaster. Also check how is working for this country. Do you see total disaster coming for this country should socialists continue to get a hold to the government? I do. Is just a mater of time. Wake up and be realistic and pragmatic. because of our very nature, it is totaly impossible to have a socialist sistem all perfect as discribed by marx utopia, because we are all corrupt. Power corrupts. Capitalism may not be perfect, even corrupt if you will, but is, with out room for doubts, the best sistem there is and this great nation speaks loudly to that reality. Socialism aka communism(is all the same thing) takes everything away from the rich and turns the poor into a slave. socialism paves the road for totalitarism in time. I know, for I,ve lived it and studied it; very well indoctrinated with marx and engels books and dialectical materialism. As far as I\'m concerned I would domp all of marx books in the septic tank for what they are worth. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.6 on 2013-02-28 04:29:29 \n         \n     To the person in \'Anonymous Comments\' who said, &quot;liberals don\'t want to see the poor get education&quot;. Are you kidding me? What country do you live in? Remember it\'s the liberals/left who fight for everyone to have an equal chance at education.\r\nIt\'s the right/Repubs who stop at nothing to prevent any sort of funding to assist people to help them get better education!\r\nHave you been smoking dope or something? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:43:21 \n         \n     Indeed, there has never been a true communist state. Remember, in true communism everyone is equal across the board. But in every so called communist country certain members of society received special favor ... in the USSR you got a bigger apartment if you were an Olympic star for example. That is not communism.\r\nBottom line, there has never been any true pure form of any communism, socialism or capitalism based country ever.\r\nIn America it\'s schools, mail system, police and fire departments are all forms of socialism.\r\nThese numbskulls who scream that Obama is a Nazi Socialist or Communist haven\'t a clue. Yet at the same time scream &quot;if you don\'t believe like me... you\'re un-American&quot; and &quot;my country right OR wrong&quot;. If anything these types of viewpoints that most right-wingers have are exactly the types that helped fuel the Nazi movement in Germany. How ironic ( read, scary) is that? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:30:12 \n         \n     Socialistic ideologies aren\'t as bad as you would think. I believe that one if the first societies to use it was the Roman Empire. They flourished under socialist ideas. I\'m not saying the country should be 100% socialist, but rather take some ideologies and put them to work in our society. \n     107.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.178 on 2013-01-01 14:47:07 \n         \n     Disgusting analysis performed by undereducated American sychophants. Communism produces a stateless society.There is no government, no currency, nothing of the nature of capitalist economics. The reason you have no understanding of it is that you attempt to put it under economic models ascribed to analyze capitalism. You cannot say that there is a single party in communism, because communism has no government. \n     76.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.33 on 2012-10-02 20:51:51 \n         \n     Of course, capitalism hampers the freedoms of everybody except the capitalist class just as much as the other systems; people work because they have to, their jobs are largely determined by economic mandates, not personal preference, and without stringent regulations, human rights abuses are as common and as severe as in communism. No system is perfect. \n     168.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.19 on 2012-06-21 04:01:27 \n         \n     Our republic should provide basic laws that generally protect the public harm, Capitalism provides the greatest freedom, who among us want to give up our free will to another man, not I. Every step away from capitalism to a socialistic/communistic system is simply tranferring some degree of our our freedom to another person or group and a step toward human rights violations that are prevalent in places like China (slavery). \r\n\r\nHuman nature dictates that individuals will prefer freedom over the other systems if they are educated to know the difference, this is why liberals prefer the poor don\'t get a useful education hence inner city grades. \r\n\r\nSome people will never be a doctor because the are either not smart enough or are not interested or generally does not suit that person, yet due to their individual likes may become very succsseful in ways no one could predict much less some bureaucrat. \n     70.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.158 on 2012-06-02 14:47:25 \n         \n     You have got this completely wrong Trotsky was a socialist you make socialism sound weak well it is not we believe in all the ideals you put forward for\r\nCommunism \n     86.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.215 on 2012-05-07 22:08:31 \n         \n     On 3/26/11 there was a comment that the free market system nearly brought down the world economy in 2008. I beg to differ! There are many who, through the propaganda spread by the left wing main stream media, believe that the present economic woes of the US and world are to be blamed on the Republicans and Capitalists. The problem started with the collapse of the mortgage industry which was brought on by our government sticking its nose into the free market system. As Republicans in congress were warning of the dangers of the subprime mortgage loans that were being made in 2008 and earlier, Barney Frank stood before the House and insisted that it was&quot;WORTH THE RISK&quot; to get more minorities into their own homes ----- whether or not they were credit worthy! Too many today want to blame the banks, forgetting that it was the government who twisted the arms of the banks to make these risky loans under the threat of hefty penalties if they did not comply. They forget that Obama himself, working for ACORN, sued Citibank over this very issue and Citibank caved in due to laws that had been put in place by an over-reaching Federal Government. And besides, the banks were safe as the risk was really being put on Fanny and Freddie -----THE TAX PAYERS! The banks, left to their own business wisdom would never have engaged in such shaky practices. It was the fault of the Democratic left wing Socialists, playing up to their base and trying to garner support, who believed that they should &quot;spread the wealth&quot;. Obama has often said that he inherited this economy from Bush but Bush was not running Congress ----- it was being run by the Democrat majority. Then the Morons in this country voted in the very people who caused the economic crash in the first place. There will always be the rich and the poor because there will always be the industrious and the slackers. Socialism/Communism always fails. Look at the Plymouth Plantation in 1620. They nearly died from starvation under communism and only prospered when they shifted to &quot;every man for himself&quot;. The Soviet Union collapsed because their economic engine had the constant drag of apathy caused by hopelessness ----- lack of opportunity to prosper. They could not compete with our economic engine ------ capitalism. Look at what is happening to the economies of Europe ------ they\'re imploding ------ too much consumption and not enough production. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.237 on 2012-01-02 01:43:09 \n         \n     Socialism is communism with lipstick on and is the stepping stone of losing your rights of proprietorship. Thats right,no more owning your own business or private property. Opportunities to Free Market Capitalism will be annihalated and there will be no more poor,middle or rich class people. The Socialists and Communists will tell you that its the best society and there will be no more racism or poverty.Try telling that to the 4.5 million people in the U.S.S.R who lost there lives as a direct result of Karl Marx\' &quot;Utopia&quot;. You would have to be a blithering idiot to co-sign on any form of socialism or communism. Capitalism may not be perfect but nothing on Planet Earth is,everything has pros and cons. There will always be greed,people who are homeless and hungry. At least Free Market Capitalism gives us an opportunity to become what we want to instead of having it dictated to us. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.138 on 2011-07-27 22:24:33 \n         \n     A Republic isn\'t the freest from of government! The freest is total anarchy or total democracy. A republic has representatives to make decision for the people. Even though they are chosen by the people that doesn\'t mean they\'re decisions reflect exactly what every person they represent wants. Anarchy has no rules whatsoever so total freedom, Democracy has everyone vote on every decision so nearly total freedom. Also no one compares Communism and Socialism with a republic because they are not on the same field. A republic is how a government is run. Communism, Capitalism, Fascism are how business is run by in the country (sometimes they r views too). Liberal, Conservative are views(also parties) of how the current government system should make decisions. So for example the US is a mix of Republic and Democracy, with Capitalism, and the two parties. The USSR was totalitarian and Communist. Also Rome and China both call themselves republics, which they were once, but we no that changed. \n     173.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.199 on 2011-05-19 00:15:32 \n         \n     One common trait shared between communism and socialism is the significant absence of freedom of choice among the individuals. I like how some try to focus the comparison of communism and socialism with capitalism rather than making the comparison with a Republic form of government. A Republic is by far offers the most freedom to individuals and the protection of individuals rights. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.150 on 2011-05-15 03:19:56 \n         \n     All of you who rave on the glory of capitalism and how it\'s the only structure that has \'worked\' seem to conveniently FORGET how the free market system virtually brought down the world in 1929 and 2008 (or the next crash that just may be the end of life as you lavishly and richly know it). And you seem to neglect all the greed, crime and corruption due to capitalism. Do you really think that a relatively young system like captialism will succeed forever? There has been no political/economical structure that has stood the test of time - they all fall for one reason or another. Do you really believe the few \'haves\' will continue to rule over the numerous \'have-nots\' because it\'s such a wonderful system? Just wait, it wont be much longer now. But there might be a better way...a blend of the best of all three systems.

With a dictatorship its easier to have more problems by getting a selfish dictator that could be a reason why communism seems to not work. Besides that they both seem about the same to me.\r\n\r\nP.S. Stop calling us Socialist-Nazis! The Nazis weren\'t socialist they were fascist, they were even against all things socialist, communist, and Jewish. The Nazi party just put socialist in their name because the government helped the &quot;master race&quot; and i think to manipulate the people into joining them since socialism was growing at this time period. They\'re Fascist-Nazis.\r\nP.P.S. Yes, I am a Communist and I would like to be dictator of America without the public noticing.

Capitalism with some regulation makes sense, this way we do not have to use tax payers money to bail out crooks that manipulate the markets, banks, and trade agreements. So capitalism as it is practiced in a democratic society like the USA, undermines democracy, it favors those in power and keeps the underclass sinking to the bottom. Socialism and Communism could work in theory if humans were more evolved and cared about the things that work for the common good. To get there we need several million years of evolution and a bigger brain to get all members of the society to agree what is good for the common good and decide to practice it with reverence and diligence.\r\nI say good luck! perhaps if aliens showed up and threatened our planet, then we would all have to work for the common good. \n     174.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.247 on 2011-02-13 20:48:57 \n         \n     Socialism is a transition period from capitalism to communism.

That is the way of Humanity. Politics is a twin to religion in that no person agrees with every tenet of their party/group/sect and has their own views as to how things should be, or what is the truth. People thrive on conflict/competition and because of that there is no &quot;system&quot; that will work for everyone, or in every situation, because we all seem to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; about almost all issues. Everyone wants more...most cannot be content just being content and need to feel &quot;better&quot; than someone to feel good about their own situation. Political leaders are usually in it for the power that comes with the office, not to really make a change for the good of the many. NO decision is for the good of everyone, except possibly the &quot;keep the stupid from breeding&quot; thing, but, good luck with that! \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.193 on 2010-09-05 17:47:09 \n         \n     ts people.

Anyone not belonging to one can thank the principles of socialism for instilling the fear of unionization into the hearts and minds of management.

But what was it that ultimately prevented the creation of a viable economy? Why was production always of such poor quality, and goods interminably scarce? The USSR certainly had natural resources and an educated workforce. The answer lies in the deincentivization of productivity. When you take away from the productive to give to the unproductive, you punish initiative and reward idleness. The economy stagnates, and a corrupt kleptocracy develops. This is a cautionary tale for the socialists/progressives/liberals of our day. The road to economic hell is paved with the good intentions of those that equate &quot;social justice&quot; with the distribution of private capital (or perhaps even its abolition) rather than its creation.

More on topic, I believe socialism relies on human good will, but our history has shown that greed, selfishness, and self gain serve as greater sources of motivation. Workers rallying and union protests for better wages and equal pay are themselves against socialist ideal because most of them want greater or distributed pay to increase their own benefit or atleast not to see others benefit more than them. Everyone wants something, capitalism works to exploit it for progress. Capitalistic monopolies however can impied on that desire so I agree with regulation to that extent and lack of a heavy &quot;anti-fire&quot; market means we do infact need fire departments. However these public services purchasing from a capital markets is what allows a better fire engine, or a powerful water pump, or lightwieght ladders. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.146 on 2010-04-05 18:30:14 \n         \n     &quot;These ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.&quot;...and Nixon, and Reagan, and Bushes, and Greenspan, and Gingrich, and Limbaugh, Beck, Leiberman, Palin, McCain... \n     72.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.130 on 2010-03-30 12:58:15 \n         \n     24.21.84.143 stated the following on 2009-10-12 23:05:18 &quot;I wish Americans would become more educated and less slaves to the false idea that everyone can be rich.

Communism uses force and socialism uses deception because no population will voluntarily accept systems that are designed to enslave everyone with no individual freedoms. They are both a modern fuedal system that allows the &quot;ruling class&quot; to make all decisions and dispose of those they feel are not productive for the whole.\r\nThese ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.

If it was easy, then anyone could do it, and it wouldn\'t be great, it would be nothing. And that is what you are going to get with Obama\'s health care when the money runs out fast!

Both assume that people are somewhat homogeneous. They are not. Substantially different ambition, energy, work ethic, sense of duty and obligation, sense of right and wrong, willingness to share and be charitable, ability to perceive and/or care about a greater community purpose, etc. Factor in peoples emotions and a persons own sense of what constitutes fairness, and communism/socialism are both dead before they get out of the theory stage. \n     64.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.180 on 2009-07-12 20:39:40 \n         \n     Any one system that all agree on will work. This is not achievable due simply in part to human nature. It is our nature to strive and succeed for a better life regardless what realm you are looking at. But there will always be those who take advantage and reap the benefits of anothers hard work. While it sounds really great in theory to give everybody this and that, not all are going to contribute and not all are going to agree. This is a fact, not a theory.If it were really possible to create a perfect society, whether it be communist, socialist or any other, why have a currency system at all? Afterall, we all agree to help each other. It cannot be done. Utopia would never last just as communism and socialism will never last without genocide to keep from having a revolution. We naturally want what we feel we deserve for the work done and to not have it given away. Having said all this, our system of not only democracy but also capitalism is not perfect either, but it allows change. \n     158.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.227 on 2009-06-21 03:22:41 \n         \n     The muddling of definitions between communism and socialism is caused by frightened capitalists. They like to lump things together and confuse definitions so that one can just easily accept their view. Not to go on about capitalist rhetoric and more to the point, from what I understand Socialism is characterized by &quot;each according to their ability&quot;, while Communism is characterized by &quot;each according to their need&quot;. Both economic systems, as Socialism and Communism are only economic systems, are theorized to be most effective under two governmental systems: Pure Democracy and Anarchy. Any literature of Communist or Socialist character freely explains this. Research, not only Marx and Engles but alsos Rosa Luxemburg. \n     67.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.89 on 2009-06-13 07:15:51 \n         \n     I believe that the main issues here are that the people, in either classification, socialism or communism, are no longer working on behalf of there own benefit. The reason we should care about this is that (and this is in really basic terms) there are some really lazy people out there. If working no longer benefits the individual, and the general population knows that they will be provided for regardless, where is the incentive to strive? If no one ever advances, why do well in your work? Communism frightens me because of potential lack of a central agency to enforce, and thereby protect. Socialism scares me because I think we can all count on one hand the politicians that actually have our best interests at heart. If they controlled everything, who is to say they would do right by the people? Everything sounds good during a campaign, but when the power is transferred, what happens? \n     70.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.185 on 2009-05-20 01:12:48 \n         \n     Can someone explain it in English? I\'m completely confused about the whole Communism/socialism thing. Is Socialism better than capitalism? Why is Socialism sometimes a synonym for communism? Why am I bothered about it all? Should I be bothered? I don\'t think i care anymore. \n     93.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.70 on 2009-05-15 23:34:05 \n         \n     great\r\n in an article titled socialism vs communism u compare socialism and capitalism...wtf, stick 2 topic \n     76.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.81 on 2009-05-02 15:51:19 \n         \n     Making a comment such as - &quot;Yes taxes are higher&quot; and then saying that you have &quot;Free&quot; programs like schooling etc is the epitomy of ignorance.

Yes the taxes are high but the costs are low. In Denmark - it is in Europe, we have socialism and we have free schools, the government actually encourage people to get an education by offering free tutoring, and we have free health care. Just because socialism helps people with less money it does not pull others down from succeeding in the global world. United States - who always has favored capitalism, had a debt on $13,050,826,460,886.97 in 2010. When a country keeps lowering taxes to keep the people happy it will increase the debt since spendings keeps going up. The U.S import in 2010 was $497.8 billion which was way higher than the export. \n     216.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.13 on 2011-03-25 13:04:15 \n     \n     \n      \n        \n     \n    \n     Related Categories Subscribe \n     \n    \n    \n    Philosophy Politics Economics    \n   \n     \n      \n   \n      \n   \n    \n     Recently Compared \n     \n    \n    \n    Certificate of Deposit vs. Money Market Account &raquo;  Chemical Peel vs. Laser Resurfacing &raquo;  GAAP vs. IFRS &raquo;  Hulu vs. Netflix &raquo;  Bottled Water vs. Tap Water &raquo;  Chicago Bulls vs. Miami Heat &raquo;  IMAP vs. POP3 &raquo;  Skim Milk vs. Whole Milk &raquo;  New York Jets vs. Pittsburgh Steelers &raquo;  Triceratops vs. Tyrannosaurus &raquo;    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n     Top 10 Comparisons on Diffen \n     \n    \n    \n    Democrat vs. Republican &raquo;  Animal Cell vs. Plant Cell &raquo;  Meiosis vs. Mitosis &raquo;  Affected vs. Effected &raquo;  Empathy vs. Sympathy &raquo;  Gross vs. Net &raquo;  DNA vs. RNA &raquo;  Full Bed vs. Queen Bed &raquo;  CT Scan vs. MRI &raquo;  Ethnicity vs. Race &raquo;    \n   \n      Tweets by @Diffen \n     \n    \n \n  \n       Log in \n       \n   Comparison Requests \n   Pop Quiz \n   Feedback \n   Blog \n   WordPress plugin \n  \n  Diffen \n  \n   \n    Compare Anything \n    \n    vs. \n    \n    Compare \n    Search for a comparison \n   \n\t \n \n \n  \n   \n    Follow @Diffen \n    \n   \n   \n    RSS \n    Mail \n   \n   \n  \n  \n\n    \n \n  \n  \n   Like this?

S'Communism: Work Ethic and Motivation \n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n  Communism and Computer Ethics \n \n \n History of Communism \n Communism in China \n Privacy \n Freedom of Speech \n Intellectual Property \n Work Ethic \n References \n About Us \n \n \n \n \n\t Work Ethic and Motivation \n  Introduction  \n Communism is often criticized for its inability to create a sustainable economic system where people have incentive to perform efficiently and act ethically in their work. The abolishment of private property is often cited as a major cause for laziness and corruption. In non-communist societies, private property is often a &#147;necessary motivation to work&#148;, Giannis Starnatellos argues in his overview of computer ethics. Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, the fathers of Communism, disagree and find that property actually stifles motivation to work in existing non-communist systems. In the Communist Manifesto , they argue: \n \n  It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us. According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those who acquire anything, do not work. The whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: There can no longer be any wage labour when there is no longer any capital. \n \n Their argument makes the subtle ass umption that all resources in the world are evidently finite. Within non-communist societies, people compete ruthlessly to obtain the largest amount of resources and property for the end goal of wealth. Because property is scarce, once all capital is privatized, the incentive to work will be non-existent because all resources will be exhausted. Since all non-communist systems will eventually succeed to this condition, the only solution, Marx and Engels argue, is to ensure no privatization of property is allowed. \n The introduction of computers and the computer industry into communism complicates finiteness of capital. Unlike the traditional sense of physical property such as land or factories, computers produce a new bountiful medium of ownership. Computers provide a means and way to create seemingly endless capital since the barriers of documenting ideas are significantly lifted through the use of applications and networking. The limited capital within the world, as described in the Communist Manifesto, has expanded to apparent infinity with the introduction of computing. Hence, the study of how computers have affected work motivation and ethics in Communism is needed. \n  The Ideal Communist Worker \n Within a communist society, people are expected to act in the interest of the Communist Party and the majority of society. Specifically, the individual is expected to work and act to promote the betterment of the community. Chairman Mao Zedong elaborates , &#147;At no time and in no circumstances should a Communist place his personal interests first; he should subordinate to the interests of the nation and the masses. Hence selfishness, slacking, corruption, seeking the limelight are most contemptible, while ... working with all one&#146;s energy, whole hearted devotion to public duty, and quiet hard work will command respect.&#148; Hence, communists are expected to work diligently and thoughtfully in order to ensure he or she provides the most benefit to society. As a result, any worker in the computer field is expected to manufacture computer products without the wish for acknowledgment or excessive monetary reward. \n Most importantly, communists are expected to surrender their own personal interests when they are in conflict with those of the Communist Party. The most fundamental philosophy of work in communism is expressed in a quote from the 2nd Chairman of the People&#146;s Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi. He writes , &#147;[The ideal communist] is the first to worry and the last to enjoy himself.&#148; Communists, in this regard, must become selfless in providing for society. When one&#146;s individual interests contradict those of the public, the individual is expected to yield. Most importantly, this means that individuals can not refuse a work assignment due to personal reasons. However, this does not mean that the Party is blind to one&#146;s abilities or strengths. Shaoqi continues, &#147;Naturally, in assigning work to members, the Party organization and the responsible Party comrade should, as far as possible, take their individual inclination and aptitude into consideration, develop their strong points and stimulate their zeal to go forward.&#148; Hence, work ethic and motivation, regardless of profession, comes from one&#146;s duty to better benefit the communal community without question or hesitation. \n Worker Practicies in Communist Societies \n Historically, Communism has been found to not foster good work ethics. Michael Lindsay explains , &#147;The actual Communist choice is almost certainly that &#147;Socialism&#148; defined in Communist terms, is a more important objective that productivity or raising the standard of living.&#148; Hence, in all transitional societies working toward Communism, work ethic and motivation appear to be extremely lacking even though everyone is assigned some task or job. For example, in a study conducted in the former USSR, over 50% of the work force admitted to drinking alcohol while on the job. Furthermore, unbeknownst to the communist party, nearly 40% chose to work a second job privately to attain more wealth ( Pereira ) . \n  A reason for failure in work ethics and motivation is the necessity that all communists must be employed. Overmanning positions trivializes the work needed to be performed and placed the concentration on quantity rather than quality. &#147;This fact,&#148; according to David Lane , &#147;gives rise to economic pressures that keep wage low and demand for labour high, which leads to widespread overstaffing and slack work standards.&#148; Instead of each person contributing, each additional excessive worker lowers the overall quality of the product. Many communist societies force upon jobs out of theoretical necessity without providing a way of sustaining interest or providing training. Therefore, Communism in practice appears to counteract the goal of making society better through communal collaboration. \n Corruption and laziness also affected the computer industry in communist societies. Instead of using computers to produce more efficient and ethical businesses, workers often used software to cause delays or discrepancies to gain personal profit. For example, an accounting computer program was implemented to help import journals and books. The software was lauded for its apparent efficiency and easy of use. However, underneath the fa&ccedil;ade, the software was programmed to pay the foreign supplier instantly but charge the domestic consumer as late as possible. This helped capitalize on the high inflation rate within the communist society and charge higher prices domestically while paying for cheap inventory ( Kalpic 1 ) . Hence, software was used to cheat the society in general because there was incentive to make more money. There have been multiple cases of unethical business practices in the same vein. \n In some instances, the reinstatement of some private property was needed to provide incentive for workers to produce useful programs and inventions. In one analysis by Tao-Tai Hsia and Kathryn Haun , they found that the Soviet Union had &#147;to offer the inventor the choice between a patent, which conferred the right to exclude others from the use of the invention, and a certificate of authorship, which vested ownership of the invention in the state, but entitle the inventor to various privileges and to remuneration based upon the economic benefits realized by the state through use of the invention.&#148; However, the very introduction of acknowledgement and reward contradicts the belief the notion of the unselfish worker. Instead of working for the betterment of the society, the introduction of patents and certificates of ownership placed work motivation on personal interests, a direct conflict of communist theory. The computer industry, along with every other industry, faces problems of inefficiency, waste, and corruption under a Communist socioeconomic policy. Communal Communities in Computing \n Although Communism in practice appears to fail in promoting work ethics and motivation, some segments of the computer industry have successfully created communal communities that work together effectively. Furthermore, instead of working in expectation of economic gain, these computing communities exist simply to provide welfare to the public. The recent rise of wiki and meta websites has allowed multiple users to contribute and collaborate together without any economic incentive. Furthermore, open-source initiatives such as Linux or Firefox have allowed the conglomerate knowledge of the public design and produce programs free to the public for use. Robert Glass elaborates , &#147;There is a faint whiff of communism about the concept of working for no financial gain . . . The sense of nobility that open source proponents feel, in working for no financial gain, resonated with some of the other basic communist philosophies.&#148; The computer industry appears to be a haven for communities that hold reminiscent characteristics of Communism. \n Despite the communal aspect of these computer communities, China has been cautious in welcoming them. Most recently, the Chinese Communist Party has blocked Wikipedia since August 31, 2007, &#147;continuing a saga of on-again, off-again availability&#148; ( Schwankert ). Although wiki and meta websites provide a means so that the public can contribute knowledge, the Chinese site continuously blocks sites of similar nature since they do not align or harmonize with the Party&#146;s interest. \n Communal computer communities have also been met with mixed reception outside China. For example, Jaron Lanier, a director and computer scientist, writes in his article, &#147; Digital Maoism: The Hazards of the New Online Collectivism &#148; , about the dangerous by-products of computer collectivism. His main concern is that the inundation of collective knowledge may lend people to believe that this communal information is always correct and &#147;all-knowing&#148;. He writes, &#147;In the last year or two the trend has been to remove the scent of people, so as to come as close as possible to simulating the appearance of content emerging out of the Web as if it were speaking to us as a supernatural oracle. This is where the user of the Internet crosses the line into delusion.&#148; The continual erasure of identifiable individual thought and personality is seen to have dire consequences when manipulated with malicious intent. \n However, it appears that Communism, especially Maoism, attempts to ameliorate the distinct loss of individual personality and credit in communal works. Within Shaoqi&#146;s book regarding &#147; How to Be a Good Communist &#148;, he attempts to resolve the problem of losing individualism. Instead of the Communist Party trying to wipe out individuality, it must develop the people&#146;s &#147;inclinations and aptitudes in conformity with its interests, furnish them with suitable work and working conditions and commend and reward them.&#148; Therefore, the communal community found within computer science is not faceless. The individual continues to take responsibility for his work and actions judged upon by the public. Yet, while society is still in socioeconomic transition, the Party&#146;s interest takes precedence when the two &#147;are at variance&#148;. \n Communism theoretically supports work ethics and motivation within the computer industry by stratifying personal, public, and Party interests. However, in practice, the computer industry within Communist societies suffers from laziness, greed, and unethical behavior. Although Communism does not appear to support work ethic and motivation, sectors of the computer industry do appear to mimic the communal communities valued within communism. Unfortunately, these sectors are sometimes blocked from developing Communist states in the interest of the Communist Party.'

this April 13, 2013 file photo, Chile\'s former President Michelle Bachelet smiles as she speaks to supporters after being officially named as candidate for the presidency by the Socialist Party and the Party for Democracy in Santiago, Chile. Bachelet, who was president from 2006 to 2010, is reaching out to the now-legal Communist Party and other left-leaning groups in her bid to return to the nation&#8217;s top post. (AP Photo/Luis Hidalgo, File)  SANTIAGO, Chile - Communist and other leftists were considered enemies of the state during Chile\'s military dictatorship, a 17-year period that saw thousands of people killed and disappeared for their politics. \r\n But as this year\'s elections nears, former President Michelle Bachelet, who was detained and tortured under the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is reaching out to the now-legal Communist Party and other left-leaning groups in her bid to return to the nation\'s top post. \r\n It\'s a politically pragmatic move in a country plagued by mounting social demands and frequent protests. \r\n But it\'s also part of Bachelet\'s goal, assuming she regains the presidency, to oversee an overhaul of the education and tax systems, which would be the country\'s most wide-ranging reform in four decades. \r\n Chile, the world\'s top producer of copper, is respected for its fast-growing economy, strong institutions and low unemployment. But it also has the worst inequality rate among the 34 countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. \r\n As a presidential candidate, Bachelet needs the backing of the Communists and liberal social groups in the face of mounting demands and protests clamouring for a wider distribution of Chile\'s copper wealth, the preservation of the environment and free education. \r\n Chile currently has two major electoral blocs, the centre-left Concertacion coalition Bachelet leads and a centre-right grouping that has said it will not back her proposals. Belonging to the country\'s Socialist Party, Bachelet says a change in the constitution is needed to break with the two-coalition system in place since the military dictatorship and allow one side or another to collect enough votes for significant change. \r\n Enormously popular in the last year of her 2006-2010 presidency, Bachelet is now the front-runner in the Nov. 17 vote. A survey by the pollster Centro de Estudios Publicos found that 54 per cent of respondents who had made up their minds on a candidate said they would vote for Bachelet, far ahead of any other name. If that number holds, it would help her avoid a runoff election mandated if no candidate wins a majority of votes. \r\n The CEP poll, conducted between November and December of last year, interviewed 1,484 people and had a margin of error of three percentage points. \r\n Bachelet recently announced her plans to run for president after spending 2 1/2 years in New York as the first executive director of UN Women, the United Nations\' new agency for women and gender issues. \r\n "Given the characteristics of Michelle Bachelet, the question is not whether she\'ll win in the first or second round but whether she\'ll win the whole thing, and the answer is yes," said Bernardo Navarrete, a University of Santiago political scientist. \r\n Bachelet hasn\'t directly mentioned courting the Communist Party but has echoed their demands for education and constitutional reform. \r\n "Chile needs a founding document born in democracy, a constitution aligned with the present conditions of Chile, that guarantees the economic and social rights to all Chileans," Bachelet said while announcing her pre-candidacy last month. \r\n The other leading political group in Chile is the centre-right Coalition for Change, which has been unable to capitalize on the country\'s economic success under the bloc\'s standard-bearer President Sebastian Pinera. Pinera enjoyed only a 31 per cent approval rating in the late-2012 poll, and 29 per cent approval for his handling of the economy. \r\n On top of that, the coalition was dealt a tough blow this week when its presidential candidate Laurence Golborne, a charismatic businessman seen by the Pinera government as its best hope, was forced out of the race by a financial scandal. \r\n The coalition chose Economy Minister Pablo Longueira as his replacement. A veteran politician who was close to Pinochet, Longueira has criticized Bachelet for reaching out to the Communist Party and has indicated he would oppose any efforts to return to a more state-funded education system. \r\n Bachelet\'s military father worked for Socialist President Salvador Allende and, like his wife and daughter Michelle, was detained and tortured after the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that ended Allende\'s rule. Bachelet\'s father eventually died of a heart attack in custody. \r\n Pinochet pushed for the privatization of state enterprises and ended central control and funding of the nation\'s school system. Reversing those laws became a rallying cry during student marches over the past two years that have halted Chile and pushed education reform to the top of the national agenda. \r\n Student leaders have focused their demands on restoring free, quality public education and have said they can bring about that change through votes, after previously pouring most of their energies into street protests. \r\n Among the top Communist Party leaders Bachelet must woo is well-known student activist Camila Vallejo, who inspired millions during the education protests. Vallejo is running for Congress, part of a push by her party to win 10 legislative seats. \r\n Without the backing of leftists such as Vallejo, Bachelet "would be unable to crystalize reform processes because she would lack enough votes," said Marcelo Mella, a political analyst at the University of Santiago. \r\n But since Chile\'s return to democracy in 1990, the Communist Party has resisted joining the Concertacion coalition and instead banded with other more leftist groups. Vallejo has said she won\'t give Bachelet her vote or support without knowing more about her political agenda. The goal, Vallejo has said, is electing more non-Concertacion lawmakers who would support raising corporate taxes and undoing Pinochet-era education, health and pension reforms. \r\n "What we need at this moment is a Congress that is mostly in the opposition and that has enough lawmakers to allow us to make changes," Vallejo told the University of Chile radio station in an interview. \r\n "That\'s what we need in such a crucial moment. Even candidate Michelle Bachelet says it." \r\n \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0  E-mail this Article  Print this Article  Share this Article  \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0  Story Tools \xc2\xa0  E-mail this Article  Print this Article  \xc2\xa0 Font:  *  *  *  *  *  \xc2\xa0 Image:  *  *  *  *  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n \r\n \r\n\t Spotlights \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\t \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\t \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n \xc2\xa0 \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n   Story tips, photos to share?

S'Chile\'s Bachelet courts Communists for big reforms   NEWS [ Home ]  Home | U.S. | World   Chile\'s Bachelet courts Communists for big reforms Associated Press - 3 hrs ago   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Communist and other leftists were considered enemies of the state during Chile\'s military dictatorship, a 17-year period that saw thousands of people killed and disappeared for their politics. But as this year\'s elections nears, former President Michelle Bachelet, who was detained and tortured under the regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, is reaching out to the now-legal Communist Party and other left-leaning groups in her bid to return to the nation\'s top post. It\'s a politically pragmatic move in a country plagued by mounting social demands and frequent protests. But it\'s also part of Bachelet\'s goal, assuming she regains the presidency, to oversee an overhaul of the education and tax systems, which would be the country\'s most wide-ranging reform in four decades. Chile, the world\'s top producer of copper, is respected for its fast-growing economy, strong institutions and low unemployment. But it also has the worst inequality rate among the 34 countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a presidential candidate, Bachelet needs the backing of the Communists and liberal social groups in the face of mounting demands and protests clamoring for a wider distribution of Chile\'s copper wealth, the preservation of the environment and free education. Chile currently has two major electoral blocs, the center-left Concertacion coalition Bachelet leads and a center-right grouping that has said it will not back her proposals. Belonging to the country\'s Socialist Party, Bachelet says a change in the constitution is needed to break with the two-coalition system in place since the military dictatorship and allow one side or another to collect enough votes for significant change. Enormously popular in the last year of her 2006-2010 presidency, Bachelet is now the front-runner in the Nov. 17 vote. A survey by the pollster Centro de Estudios Publicos found that 54 percent of respondents who had made up their minds on a candidate said they would vote for Bachelet, far ahead of any other name. If that number holds, it would help her avoid a runoff election mandated if no candidate wins a majority of votes. The CEP poll, conducted between November and December of last year, interviewed 1,484 people and had a margin of error of three percentage points. Bachelet recently announced her plans to run for president after spending 2 1/2 years in New York as the first executive director of UN Women, the United Nations\' new agency for women and gender issues. "Given the characteristics of Michelle Bachelet, the question is not whether she\'ll win in the first or second round but whether she\'ll win the whole thing, and the answer is yes," said Bernardo Navarrete, a University of Santiago political scientist. Bachelet hasn\'t directly mentioned courting the Communist Party but has echoed their demands for education and constitutional reform. "Chile needs a founding document born in democracy, a constitution aligned with the present conditions of Chile, that guarantees the economic and social rights to all Chileans," Bachelet said while announcing her pre-candidacy last month. The other leading political group in Chile is the center-right Coalition for Change, which has been unable to capitalize on the country\'s economic success under the bloc\'s standard-bearer President Sebastian Pinera. Pinera enjoyed only a 31 percent approval rating in the late-2012 poll, and 29 percent approval for his handling of the economy. On top of that, the coalition was dealt a tough blow this week when its presidential candidate Laurence Golborne, a charismatic businessman seen by the Pinera government as its best hope, was forced out of the race by a financial scandal. The coalition chose Economy Minister Pablo Longueira as his replacement. A veteran politician who was close to Pinochet, Longueira has criticized Bachelet for reaching out to the Communist Party and has indicated he would oppose any efforts to return to a more state-funded education system. Bachelet\'s military father worked for Socialist President Salvador Allende and, like his wife and daughter Michelle, was detained and tortured after the Sept. 11, 1973, coup that ended Allende\'s rule. Bachelet\'s father eventually died of a heart attack in custody. Pinochet pushed for the privatization of state enterprises and ended central control and funding of the nation\'s school system. Reversing those laws became a rallying cry during student marches over the past two years that have halted Chile and pushed education reform to the top of the national agenda. Student leaders have focused their demands on restoring free, quality public education and have said they can bring about that change through votes, after previously pouring most of their energies into street protests. Among the top Communist Party leaders Bachelet must woo is well-known student activist Camila Vallejo, who inspired millions during the education protests. Vallejo is running for Congress, part of a push by her party to win 10 legislative seats. Without the backing of leftists such as Vallejo, Bachelet "would be unable to crystalize reform processes because she would lack enough votes," said Marcelo Mella, a political analyst at the University of Santiago. But since Chile\'s return to democracy in 1990, the Communist Party has resisted joining the Concertacion coalition and instead banded with other more leftist groups. Vallejo has said she won\'t give Bachelet her vote or support without knowing more about her political agenda. The goal, Vallejo has said, is electing more non-Concertacion lawmakers who would support raising corporate taxes and undoing Pinochet-era education, health and pension reforms. "What we need at this moment is a Congress that is mostly in the opposition and that has enough lawmakers to allow us to make changes," Vallejo told the University of Chile radio station in an interview. "That\'s what we need in such a crucial moment. Even candidate Michelle Bachelet says it."   68 comments   Following the lead of the USA !

S'The Woman Worker and Peasant in Soviet Russia \n \n \n \n Alexandra Kollontai \n \nThe Woman Worker and Peasant in Soviet Russia \n \n \n Source: Alexandra Kollontai: Selected Articles and Speeches, Progress Publishers, 1984; \n First Published: The Woman Worker and Peasant in Soviet Russia, Gosizdat, 1921, abridged; \n Transcribed: Sally Ryan for marxists.org, 2000. \n \n \nIn Soviet Russia there is no independent movement of women\nworkers. In Soviet Russia the proletariat of both sexes are\nindissolubly united in their struggle to establish and\nconsolidate the dictatorship (of the proletariat-Tr.) and to\nbuild the new society of working people. \n \nHowever, precisely in order to ensure this unity, this joint struggle and joint work, the Communist Party had to include among its tasks the special task of involving women actively in the construction of a new future and in the conscious defence of the first republic of working people against its internal and external enemies. \n \nThis task was formulated by the Bolshevik Party as far back as\nthe eve of the revolution, the spring of 1917, when the\neditorial board of the magazine Rabotnitsa was set up\nunder the party Central Committee in order to serve not only as\na centre of propaganda work among the female proletariat, but\nalso as a centre organising women workers around the banner of\nBolshevism. \n \nAt a time when bourgeois chauvinism and Kerenskyism were in full flood and the dangers of conciliation had not yet been finally eliminated, the editorial board of Rabotnitsa, responding in early June, 1917, to Kerensky\'s call for the Russian army to advance, organised a large international meeting calling for opposition to the criminal slaughter of the war and for world-wide worker solidarity against the common enemy-the capitalists-and their loyal servants, the conciliators. This was the first open international meeting in Russia. \n \nIn autumn, 1917, with the struggle of the proletariat for Soviet\npower having intensified, and faced with the threat of an\noffensive by General Kornilov, the most progressive and\nconscious section of women workers came out in support of the\nBolsheviks and became actively involved in the civil war that\nhad broken out. However, the broad mass of women workers and\npeasants remained outside the movement, passively bearing the\nincreasing burden of economic collapse, deprivation and\nsuffering that inevitably accompany the clash between two social\nworlds. \n \nThe Great October Revolution and the transfer of power into the hands of the working people gave women in Russia full political and civil equality. A new age opened up before women workers and peasants. An end had been put to their former, age-old lack of rights. From that moment on, women enjoyed total equality in every sphere of the work and life of the state. From the very first days following the October Revolution, the Communist Party hastened to make use of the energies of women communists and women workers sympathetic to Soviet power. Women were appointed Commissars, were given important posts, and even sat on the Council of People\'s Commissars. They were given work in every section of the newly formed Soviet state apparatus... \n \nThe doors of the Communist Party stood open to women of the\nworking class, and the law gave them every opportunity to\nparticipate in the work of the Soviets to reshape their way of\nlife and thus improve their own living conditions... However,\nthe broad mass of women workers and peasants (taken in the\nmajority) looked with fear upon communists and Soviet power,\nseeing in them only the destroyers of the fundamental order and\nancient traditions, \'godless\' people who separated church and\nstate, heartless people who wished to take children away from\ntheir mothers and hand them over to be brought up by the\nstate. \n \nStarvation and deprivation further stimulated the blind resentment of the women, who transmitted to their families ideas and attitudes hostile to communism. \n \nIn the autumn of 1918 after the attempt by counterrevolution,\nwith the assistance of the Czechoslovaks, to smash the\nBolsheviks and put an end to Soviet power, the party recognised\nthe urgency of the problem of involving women workers in Soviet\nconstruction and raising their level of class-consciousness. The\nwomen, who had stood aside from the movement to consolidate the\nSoviets, were already becoming a factor actively assisting\ncounter-revolution. \n \nIn the interests of communism it was necessary to win over the women workers and turn them into defenders of Soviet power. General propaganda of the ideas of Soviet power and communism proved insufficient to draw women into the movement. A special approach had to be found as regards the women workers and poorest peasants; a special method of work among women had to be developed in order to force them to understand and appreciate what their position should be and which power best guaranteed women\'s interests &#8211; the dictatorship of the proletariat, or a return to the rule of the bourgeoisie. \n \nOn the initiative of a group of communist women in Moscow, and\nwith the full support of the Central Committee of the Russian\nCommunist Party, the First All-Russia Congress of Women Workers\nand Peasants was convened in Moscow in November, 1918. It was\nattended by over a thousand women delegates elected at women\nworkers\' and peasants\' meetings. This congress was not only of\nenormous propaganda significance, but also laid the foundations\nfor the creation within the Russian Communist Party of a\nspecial, all-Russia apparatus for conducting work among\nwomen. The creation of a special apparatus within the party\nwhose purpose was to draw the mass of the female population into\nthe construction of a republic of working people and into the\nstruggle for communism thus received official recognition within\nthe party. \n \nTo begin with, responsibility for this work was assumed by the Commissions for Propaganda Among Women Workers, organised under the auspices of party committees. The slogan of the commissions ran: \'propaganda in deeds as well as words\', which meant that women workers and peasants were to be turned into conscious and active communists via involvement in the creative practical work of the Soviets. With this in view, the commissions created a special apparatus linking the party with the broad mass of backward working women. This apparatus was the council of women delegates. Each enterprise and each workshop was to send one woman delegate for every fifty women workers to the delegate council of women workers. The delegates were elected for three months, and their attendance at weekly delegate councils, at which they were informed about recent political events, about the work being done in various branches of Soviet construction, and in particular about social education, public catering, protection of motherhood and other areas of state activity directly assisting the domestic emancipation of working woman, was compulsory. The delegates not only attended the councils, but were also charged with a number of practical activities which included\nmembership of the commissions on labour protection, on improving living conditions, on provision for motherhood, etc., operating at their own enterprises, visits of inspection to state institutions in order to become familiar with the methods and systems of work used in various branches of the state apparatus, and also co-operating in various party and state campaigns. As the work done by the party among the women increased, it became necessary to regulate it, make it more efficient and thorough-going. In the autumn of 1919, the party reorganised the Commissions for Propaganda Among Women Workers into departments for work among women. Such departments now form part of every local party committee, from the Central Committee to city, district and uyezd committees. \n \nThe departments for work among women not only involve women\nworkers and peasants in the party and in state construction,\nturning them into active women Communists, but also bring\nindependent initiative into the building of communism, putting\nbefore the party and state organs tasks related to the\ncomprehensive and practical emancipation of women. Thus, on the\ninitiative of the departments, abortion was legalised, and the\nproposal advanced at the Eighth Congress of Soviets on actively\ninvolving women workers in the rehabilitation of the economy and\norganisation of production by bringing women into all the organs\nof economic management has been adopted. The\ninter-departmental commission for the campaign against\nprostitution, and the commissions to promote the protection of\nmother and child were also set up on the initiative of these\ndepartments. During the elaboration of the law on the obligation\nto work (April, 1920) they introduced a number of clauses\nrelating to the protection of the physical strength, health and\ninterests of mothers. Finally, in April of this year, on the\ninitiative of the women\'s departments, a law was passed through\nthe Council of People\'s Commissars on involving women workers\nand peasants in the practical work of executive committee\ndepartments and institutions for a period of two months with a\nview to infusing new life into the state apparatus and freeing\nit from bureaucratic elements, and also in order to train state\nexecutives from among the women workers. \n \nOver the two and a half years since the creation within the party of the special apparatus to conduct work among women with a view to involving women workers and\npeasants in the construction of a republic of working people ...and drawing them into communism, enormous progress has been made. The former mistrustful or passive attitude among the mass of women to the revolution and to Soviet power is now found only in the most remote areas where the women\'s departments have not yet begun to expand their activities. \n \nOf the total party membership, 9-10 per cent is comprised of\nwomen. According to the latest figures (February-March), there\nare 3,842 women communists in 12 provinces, including: \n \n \n women workers \n 2,406 \n intelligentsia \n 1,010 \n peasants \n 426 \n total \n 3,842 \n \n \n \nThe number of delegates in these provinces totals 12,910. \n \nOn the most conservative estimates, the number of delegates linked to the women workers\' departments, and therefore under the influence of the Communist Party, is more than 70 thousand. These 70 thousand delegates elected from among women workers, housewives and peasant women (the latter elected on a village basis) represent a female population numbering more than 3 million, all linked to the party. Through their deputies, these 3 million women are involved in one way or another in the practical work of state construction either in the sphere of production organisation, or in national defence, or in the re-organisation of daily life and living conditions on new communist principles. Thus, for example, in the 12 provinces for which we have the most recent figures, 6,930 women workers took part in subbotniks, and 2,975 women workers and peasants worked in Soviet institutions. \n \nThus, through active, practical participation in the work to\nrehabilitate the economy, help the Red Army, develop\nagriculture, provide for children (Children\'s Week), overcome\nthe fuel crisis and get the transport system working again,\netc., the party is gradually moulding out of hundreds of\nthousands of \'non-party\' women workers and peasants not only\nnew, fresh forces working for the Soviet system, but also\nconscious defenders of the republic of the working people and of communism. The broad mass of women workers has already ceased to be the bulwark of counter-revolution. These three years of special work among women have succeeded not only in awakening their political consciousness, but also In accustoming them to active participation in the construction of the new society. \n \nImmediately following the revolution, women were elected as members of \nthe Soviets. However, the election of women was still rare, an exception to the rule. Women were more commonly used to help carry through the designated tasks, and it was a rarity for women to be given administrative\nposts involving decision-making. Even now there are not many women workers and peasants who are members of the Soviets. For example, in the 12 provinces referred to above, there are only 635 women members of Soviets, that is, an average of 52 members for each province. Moreover, in the uyezd Soviets the number of women members is 574, while in the provincial Soviets there are only seven... \n \nWomen workers have been particularly active over recent years in\nthe inspection of various institutions, primarily canteens,\nhospitals and all the children\'s institutions that form part of\nthe network of social upbringing. A number of abuses in these\ninstitutions, mismanagement, incompetence, and sometimes a\ndeliberately obstructive approach on the part of representatives\nof the petty-bourgeois elements that poured into state\ninstitutions, were discovered thanks to the vigilant eye and\nconscientiousness of the women workers. In the afore-mentioned\n12 provinces, 3,436 women worker delegates sat on\ninspection commissions. In Petrograd, around 500 women\ndelegates took part in the inspection of infirmaries. According\nto the figures of the Workers\' and Peasants\' Inspection, up to\n25 thousand women workers and peasants were actively involved in\nlarge-scale inspections throughout the whole of Russia. When the\nrepublic of working people was faced with the problem of looking\nafter wounded Red Army soldiers, Moscow women workers, under the\nleadership of the women workers\' departments, immediately\norganised groups of 20-50 delegates who visited the army\nhospitals once a week, inspected them, reported on inadequacies\nto the appropriate institution and organised subbotniks to clean\nthe infirmaries and mend the clothes of the wounded. When there\nwere not enough medical orderlies, the delegates helped to\ntransport the ill and the wounded,\nvisited them, read them newspapers, wrote their letters for them, etc. According to the People\'s Commissariat for Health, the women delegates played a not unimportant role in the improvement of conditions in Moscow hospitals. \n \nAs regards the involvement of women in military affairs. the\nSoviet republic of the working people has adopted a completely\nnew approach. The bourgeoisie has always based itself on the\nview that the woman was and should remain the preserver of the\nhome, while nature has determined that the man should defend it,\nor, by extension, should defend the fatherland, the\nstate. \n \n\'War,\' according to the bourgeoisie,\'is men\'s business.\' The idea of taking women into the armed forces appeared monstrous to bourgeois society. It would undermine the \'foundations of the family\' &#8211; an institution essential to private property and the class-based state. \n \nThe use of female personnel during the last imperialist war,\nparticularly in England, was significant not so much as a\npractical state measure, but rather as a particular form of\npatriotic propaganda. \n \nA very different attitude is developing in the state of the working people to the involvement of women workers and peasants into the army for the self-defence of the republic of the working people. In the transitional period through which we are now passing, the two duties of each member of the state of the working people to work and to defend that republic are fusing together. The great revolution that took place in October, 1917, in the organisation of production and in the national economy of Russia have had a radical effect upon the lives of women and their role in the state. The communist state, in which all the available reserves of adult citizens are taken into account in order to be put to more rational use and in order to develop the national productive forces more successfully, is already unable to dispense with the part played by women. Just as the basic economic system requires, in the interests of the working class, that the greatest possible number of women be involved in it, so also the self-defence of the working class against bourgeois domination requires that women workers and peasants be used for the army and the navy. The involvement of women, of women workers and peasants, in military affairs is dictated hot by short-term political considerations, such as those that guided the bourgeois governments in the imperialist war, but by the fundamental objectives of the working class.\nThe broader the participation by the working population in its vital objectives, the more successfully will the workers and peasants\' army be able to defend the revolution. \n \nThe Red Army needs the active involvement of women workers and\npeasants. Women should be used to ensure success at the front\nprecisely because this victory is essential to the women\nthemselves for their total emancipation and the consolidation\nof those rights which the October Revolution has won for\nthem. Therefore the participation of women workers and peasants\nin the Soviet class army is to be evaluated not only in terms of\nthe practical aid which women have already supplied to the army\nand the war front. but also in terms of that inevitable radical\nchange introduced by the question of involving women in military\nmatters. While the October Revolution paved the way for the\nabolition of the former inequality between the sexes, the active\ninvolvement of women on our common basic fronts-the labour front\nand the war front &#8211; will destroy the lingering prejudices that\nfed this inequality. \n \nWomen workers and peasants were involved in the civil, class war from the very first barricade battles in 1917. Just as the Red Guards" emerged spontaneously in the workers\' districts, so also there arose, just as spontaneously, auxiliary detachments of women medical orderlies, Red nurses, and simply groups of volunteer women workers and peasants who assumed one function or another in the Red Guards during and immediately after the October days. However, at that time the involvement of women workers and peasants was not a mass phenomenon, nor was it organised. It was only from the end of 1918 onwards that the women workers and peasants of the Soviet Republic began to take part in military affairs on an organised basis. When the Red Army was formed to replace the Red Guards, the government of workers and peasants did, it is true, appeal for co-operation not only by men, but also by women. However, it did not prove possible at first to find a practical, useful way of making widespread use of women at the front. \n \nThe active involvement of working women in the Red Army consists\nprimarily in the formation of an entire detachment of women\ncommunists who function as political propagandists in the army,\nas political workers. Many of these women political workers in\nthe army died alongside their comrades in defence of Soviet\npower, while others returned decorated with the Order of the\nRed Banner. \n \nEven in the army Military Revolutionary Councils the number of women members was very small. The political sections of the Red Army are to a large degree the creation of the talented organiser, comrade Varsenika-Kasparova. \n \nThe second way in which women workers are involved in military\nmatters is as Red nurses and medical orderlies. The first\ntrained Red nurses from among women workers who had attended\nspecial courses arrived at the front in November, 1919, and a\nnumber of documents testify to their selfless work and that of\nthe medical orderlies. \n \nOver a period of two years, up to 6,000 trained women workers, Red nurses and medical orderlies have been sent to the front... \n \nThe women workers and peasants serving as Red nurses and\nmedical orderlies have shown cheerfulness and enthusiasm in\ntheir work. The Red nurse treats the wounded Red Army soldier\nfirst and foremost as a comrade and brother, and does not show\nthat sickly-sweet condescension with which the bourgeois nurse\napproached the \'poor soldier\'. \n \nThe organisation of medical assistance to the army has opened before the women workers and peasants a wide sphere of necessary and important work, particularly at a moment when Soviet Russia is experiencing bitter class conflict. \n \nHowever, the role of women in the defence of the Soviet Republic\nis not limited to the organisation of medical assistance. One\nonly has to remember the critical moments in the struggle, when\nall the gains of our revolution were in danger, to realise how\ngreat and important a role women workers and peasants have\nplayed in the self-defence of the republic. Three episodes in\nthe class war over the last three years serve to illustrate this\nvery clearly: the attack by the Whites on the Donbas and Lugansk\nin 1919, the Denikin threat to Tula and the Yudenich threat to\nRed Petrograd in the autumn of the same year; Lugansk succeeded\nin repelling the second attack on the Red city by White Guard\nbands thanks only to the massive and active participation of\nworking men and women in every sphere of defence. Particularly\nmemorable is the resolute stand adopted by the working women of\nTula during Denikin\'s advance: \'Denikin will reach Moscow only\nover our dead bodies,\' declared the women workers, who were then\nfulfilling a variety of roles and carrying out every kind of\nwork for the front, from\ndigging trenches to army communications. The fame of the women workers of Petrograd, who repelled the attack by Yudenich, is too well known to need repetition here. The proletarian women of Petrograd not only provided 500 Red nurses and medical orderlies for the front, but also served in their thousands in the machine-gun companies, in communications, in sapper companies, and laboured selflessly in the cold autumn weather to dig trenches and surround Petrograd with barbed wire... \n \nNot only in Moscow, but throughout the whole of Russia, the\nsystem of universal military training is drawing young women\nworkers and peasants into military matters, thus gradually\ncreating the reserves necessary to defend the republic from\ninternational predators. \n \nDuring the last three years, not one recruitment campaign has been conducted in which women have not taken an active part. Women workers and peasants helped to combat army desertion, and to collect the necessary army equipment; they visited infirmaries and concerned themselves about the fate of sick and wounded Red Army soldiers. The appeal from the Red front found a warm response in the hearts of women workers and peasants. The industrial centres in particular sent a large number of women to the front. Her class sense tells the woman worker that the total emancipation of women is indissolubly linked with each first victory of the Red front. \n \nIn May of this year, the first women workers will complete their\ncourse in military communications. Over the last few months\ncourses for women telephonists and telegraph operators have\nbecome available in various parts of the country; the latest\ngraduates completed courses in Samara and Simbirsk in the summer\nof 1920, and provided efficient cadres for the Southern and\nSouth-Western fronts. \n \nThe heroism of the women workers and peasants, their direct involvement in battle and their fearlessness under fire is referred to in dispatches from General Headquarters. The number of Red Army women who have been killed, wounded or taken prisoner is 1,854. Many women have been awarded the Order of the Red Banner: medical orderlies, telephonists, Red Army women soldiers in machine-gun detachments, medical orderlies, doctors, etc. \n \nWomen workers have also played an important role in organising\nthe public catering service. They are involved in the\norganisation of public canteens, in food quality control,\nin the management of canteens and the organisation of a special children\'s food service. Women delegates organise a duty roster for mothers at children\'s canteens. In some places (for example Kiev, the Moscow province, etc.), women workers took the first steps to organise factory canteens. In the provincial capitals of Russia almost the entire population is now using the public catering service. About five million people now use canteens, which shows first and foremost that, in what concerns the emancipation of women from the slavery of housework, working Russia has managed during the four years following the revolution to achieve that which no bourgeois country would have dared attempt. Up to 75 thousand women are now employed in the public catering service. \n \nWomen workers are particularly active in social education. This\narea of Soviet policy is the one that even backward women\nworkers can most easily understand and sympathize with. Numerous\nchildren\'s institutions: children\'s homes, creches and\nnurseries &#8211; are run by women workers. Women delegates are helping\nSoviet organs of government to organise new institutions and\nimprove those that already exist. Under the pressure of women\nCommunists working in social education, the former charitable\n\'refuges\' for orphans-those breeding grounds producing servile\nand will-less servants of the bourgeoisie &#8211; are disappearing, to\nbe replaced by new forms of social education for children in the\nhealthy environment of children\'s homes, kindergartens, and\nplaygrounds where women workers can leave their children with an\neasy heart. It is true that material obstacles such as the\nshortage of equipment, textbooks, clothing and a normal supply\nof food are severely impeding the exemplary organisation of\n\'social education\'. However, the policy laid down by the Soviet\ngovernment in this sphere is receiving the energetic support of\nmany communist women, and the very idea of social education is\ngradually penetrating the consciousness of broad masses of\nwomen workers. A number of women communists-comrades Nikolayeva\n(a former woman worker), Lilina, Yelizarova, Dyushenhave made\ntheir valuable contribution to this cause and assisted the\nprogress of this difficult and responsible work while the names\nof comrades Nadezhda Krupskaya and L. Menzhinskaya are\ninseparably linked with the creation of one, unified school of\nlabour and the organisation of widespread out-of-school\neducation. \n \nNot only in the capital cities of Soviet Russia, but also in\nmany provincial towns, courses have been started for children\'s\nnurses, kindergarten teachers, women creche organisers,\netc., and women workers are being sent to attend them. \n \nClosely linked to the activities of women workers in the sphere of social education is the work done by women delegates and women communists to ensure protection for mother and child. On the initiative of the women\'s departments, special Commissions of Support have been organised as part of the subdivision concerned with the protection of mother and child. These special commissions are to assist in the broad practical implementation of those decrees on the protection of motherhood which, for a number of technical reasons, and particularly as a result of the dislocation of the national economy, are in effect only benefiting an extremely small number of working women. \n \nThe Commissions of Support, under the leadership of the women\'s\ndepartments, are conducting a campaign to spread the idea of\nprotecting mother and child, and are familiarising women workers\nat their place of work with the basic laws on the protection of\nexpectant and nursing mothers at work, and are checking on the\nimplementation of all legislation in this area. \n \nWomen workers in the Ukraine are particularly active in the sphere of the protection of motherhood, and each enterprise has a group concerned with this issue. Women workers are the directors of numerous institutions, creches, mother and child homes, and themselves run the local departments. \n \nComrade Moirova, who is in charge of the Ukrainian Department\nof Women Workers under the Central Committee of the\nCommunist Party of the Ukraine, is a tireless worker who shows\ngreat initiative. In just one year she has succeeded in raising\nthe work of the women\'s departments in the sphere of protection\nof mother and child to the necessary level, having begun this\nwork in the Ukraine under the guidance of one of the leading\nfigures in work among the female proletariat in Russia, Comrade\nKonkordia Samoilova. \n \nThere is still one major and difficult task to be carried through in the sphere of protection of mother and child. At present, the measures taken to protect and provide for motherhood benefit only women working in factories and\nplants, and even countryside, even summer creches are few in number. However, this task has already been set, and will be dealt with as soon as it is materially possible to do so... \n \nThe protection of motherhood is impossible without the proper\norganisation of labour protection at factories. Despite the fact\nthat the principle of equal pay for equal work was established\nin Soviet Russia from the very first moment of the revolution,\nmost women workers in fact continue to do lower-paid work. The\nfact that women often lack qualifications means that women\nbelong to\nthe lower-paid category of workers. Moreover, very little has been done to improve sanitation and hygiene at factories. Harmful, unhealthy conditions of work seriously affect women workers, particularly if one takes into account the fact that decrees are implemented only under pressure from the Commissions of Labour Protection. Women workers are being brought into these commissions and made responsible for checking that the decrees on labour protection are implemented, for encouraging an improvement in conditions of work (provision of washrooms, cloakrooms, canteens, etc.), and in particular for concerning themselves with the help of the Commissions of Support with the protection of motherhood and the fate of nursing and pregnant women workers. \n \nOver these four years women workers have also played a major\nrole in eliminating illiteracy. The Communist Party departments\nof women workers have succeeded in drawing large numbers of\nworking women into this work. In some provinces every enterprise\nhas a woman delegate specifically selected to assist in\neliminating adult illiteracy. Women worker delegates give\ntechnical assistance to schools, teach or help to organise\nliteracy schools. \n \nIn Yekaterinburg, the women workers themselves organised a census of the illiterate. Over recent years, the question of eliminating illiteracy was raised at many conferences of women workers. \n \nWomen workers are participating in the administration of Soviet\nlaw, both as judges and as members of the jury. In particular it\nis now becoming customary for women of the Soviet East to take\npart in people\'s courts. Here, women are achieving emancipation\nfrom their everyday yoke and religious tradition only thanks\nto the support of Soviet legislation. In Bashkiria, among\nthe Kirghiz and Tatar women, and in Turkestan, the court is\none of the first stages\nof Soviet work among Muslim women who are only just awakening and becoming conscious of their rights. \n \nIn order to make more effective use of women workers in the\ncause of Soviet construction, the women\'s departments are\neverywhere seconding women workers to courses. At first, women\nworkers attended mainly courses on the protection of motherhood,\norganised by Comrade Lebedeva, who was in charge of all the work\ndone for the protection of mother and child in Soviet Russia and\nwho managed to raise this work to the necessary\nlevel. Subsequently the women started to attend courses for\nmedical orderlies and Red nurses, and courses on pre-school\nupbringing. \n \nHowever, women workers are now being seconded to all courses on Soviet construction and party work. Women delegates from the women\'s departments have been allotted 10 per cent of all the places available on party courses. In 1920 ten provinces sent 3,484 women workers and peasants to such courses through the women\'s departments. \n \nOn the initiative of the Central Women\'s Department, a special\nsection has been set up at the Sverdlov University (the central\nparty school) which introduce the students to the basic methods\nand forms of work among the female proletariat. In order to\nensure that women workers, peasants and housewives are brought\nup in the spirit of communism, the women\'s departments have\nobtained for themselves a certain number of places in schools\nand on courses and, in addition to oral propaganda of the ideas\nof communism, are also conducting systematic written propaganda\nby means of special publications. In Soviet Russia at present\nlocal party newspapers publish 74 special Working Women\'s\nSupplements every week. The Central Department publishes a\nweekly Bulletin which contains all the instructions and\nresolutions of the department, the study programmes for use both\nwith women delegates and in party schools, the theses that are\nto serve for propaganda work, and other guidelines and\ninstructions. The department also publishes a monthly\npolitical magazine, Kommunistka (Communist Woman), and\na special pamphlet which provides material for reproduction in the various local editions of the Working Women\'s Supplement. \n \nThe Central Department also has a literature board which plans\nthe publication of brochures, pamphlets and appeals. Over the\nlast year the Central Department has issued over 20 brochures,\nbooks on the protection of female labour, a report on the First\nConference of Women Communists, a number of appeals and leaflets\nrelated to political and state campaigns. \n \nThe education of the masses in the party spirit completes and resumes the Soviet experience gained by broad masses of women workers-with the active and direct co-operation of housewives and peasant women-in Soviet construction. At present, the practical communist education of the masses both by the party and by the women\'s departments is being directed towards the spheres of economic construction and the revival of production. \n \nAs one of the urgent tasks now facing the Soviet Republic is the\nrevival of production and the organisation of the national\neconomy on communist principles, the active involvement of women\nin this work is now a matter of particular importance. \n \nThe transition in Soviet Russia to universal labour conscription represented a historic turning point in the position of women. The new system of organising labour based: 1) on a rigorous assessment and rational distribution of all the existing labour reserves of the republic, including women; 2) on the transition from family consumption and individual economic units to collective production and consumption, and 3) on a unified and regulated economic plan, has radically altered the basis upon which rested the former enslavement and dependence of women. The summons of all to the labour front without distinction of sex is changing the entire traditional picture of life and relations between the sexes. The former dependence of women on the capitalist boss and husband cum bread-winner has disappeared. There is now one master, whom the working man and the working woman must both equally obey in the interests of the whole working class-the Soviet Republic of Working People. \n \nThe role played by women workers and peasants in the\norganisation of the national economy on communist\nprinciples is becoming more and more important. As the working\nmen have been drawn to the Red front, working\nwomen in Russia have become firmly established on the labour front, the economic front. According to the figures of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions, which are far from complete, of the 5.5 million workers in trade unions, the majority in a number of major branches of industry are women... \n \nAt the same time, there is no trade union that does not number\nwomen among its members, and no branch of work in which women\nare not involved. However, despite the fact that female labour\nis widely used in Soviet Russia, and that women workers\noutnumber men workers in many branches of production, the number\nof women workers in the various organs of production management,\nfrom factory committees and commissions to the central organs of\neconomic management, is still very small. The plenum of the\nPetrograd Soviet, for example, consists of 135 working men, but\nonly 25 working women. Of the 194 members of management organs\nsupervising the textile workers\' trade union in 38 provinces,\nonly 10 are women. An exception to this rule is Kostroma, where\nwomen constitute a majority in the trade union management. In\nfactory management, particularly with the transition to one-man\nmanagement, women are a rarity, with the exception of the\nclothing industry and certain textile combines where women\nworkers are members of the management organs. Women are in the\nminority at trade union congresses, and there are even fewer\nwomen at national economic congresses, and in central organs of\nmanagement. \n \nWhat is the cause of this phenomenon, and what does it tell us? One of the reasons for this lack of activity on the part of women workers in the organisation of production is the fact that the women\'s departments of the party have only recently set themselves the task of shifting the emphasis of their work from involving women in the construction of Soviet institutions to involving them in the rehabilitation of the national economy. This appeal was launched only this winter, and was clearly formulated for the first time at the Third All-Russia Conference of Provincial Women\'s Departments in December, 1920. It was then confirmed at the Eighth Congress of Soviets with the adoption of the resolution on involving women workers in all organs of management and in the organisation of the national economy. There can be no doubt that, with the increasing activity of the women\'s departments within the trade unions,\nand with the use of production propaganda not only to raise labour productivity, but also to involve women equally with men in the organisation of new forms of production, the number of women workers becoming active builders of the national economy will increase as rapidly and consistently as it is doing in the other spheres of activity connected with the reconstruction of life on new principles. \n \nWith the assistance of organisers specifically chosen to work\namong women in trade unions, with the help of production\nconferences and the skilful involvement of women workers in\ntrade union efforts to improve working conditions at the\nfactories for both men and women workers, we may confidently\nhope that the two-million-strong army of women workers can be\nmoulded into steadfast and conscious builders of communist forms\nof production. \n \nWithout the participation of women workers and peasants, victory on the labour front is impossible. On the other hand, however, the complete and actual emancipation of the 70 million women of the working republic is equally impossible without the introduction and implementation of the principles of the communist economic system and the transformation of life according to new principles. The great change brought about by the Russian proletarian revolution in the hearts and minds of the workers of both sexes makes it easier to draw the broad mass of women workers and peasants into every sphere of public and economic life. That mustering of forces made necessary by the protracted civil war has steeled the will of the workers of both sexes, and has taught them to follow Marx\'s behest that their liberation can only be achieved by their own efforts. It is now not individuals, but masses of women workers who are joining in the task of constructing the Soviet Republic. As yet, the peasant woman is only timidly following in their wake. The women among the urban poor have become conscious of their rights and have bound their future to the future of communism. The party\'s task is to find the way to the mind and heart of the peasant woman. \n \nAfter the peasant woman comes the \'last slave\', the woman of the\nEast, awakening from age-old slavery. The women\'s departments\nare vigorously pursuing their work in every area with the\npopulation of the peoples of the East and in all the eastern\nrepublics of Soviet Russia, in order to rally the forces of\nMuslim and mountain women around the banner of communism and\nSoviet power. \n \nA start has also been made in the work among women engaged in\nnon-physical labour: teachers, office workers, medical\npersonnel, telephonists and telegraph operators. \n \nOn looking back over what has been done during these revolutionary years to organise women around the banner of communism, one cannot but note with deep satisfaction the enormous successes achieved in this difficult and painstaking work. There is now no sphere of Soviet life into which women of the working class have not been drawn. Yesterday\'s woman worker or peasant is today in charge of army political sections, is transport commissar, organises public catering, heads the department for the protection of motherhood, is in charge of social education, organises reading rooms, supervises canteens, joins the food detachments, and is actively engaged in all political campaigns and all the initiatives undertaken by the republic to combat the collapse of the economy, starvation and epidemics. The woman worker is the soul of the subbotniks, and wherever her duties and obligations call her, she is a full and equal citizen. \n \nDuring the four years of the revolution, the movement of women\nworkers has changed from being spontaneous, unorganised,\namateurish and disunited to become a large-scale, systematic and\norganised phenomenon. It is increasingly clear and indisputable\nthat, without close co-operation on the part of the women, the\nproletariat will not be able to fulfil its great class task.\nThe party as a whole must now consider how to make wide-ranging\nand skilful use of this female force. The departments of women\nworkers now face the task of enriching the construction of the\nnew society by bringing to the fore those urgent and immediate\nissues which primarily affect women, and whose solution will\ndeliver the final blow to their recent enslavement by the family\nand the outdated morals of the bourgeois world. \n \nThe proletarian revolution has achieved its objective. All arguments about the inequality of women have been swept into the past. The October Revolution has created a solid basis for the comprehensive emancipation of women... \n \nA. M.

The revolutionary period lasted from November 1918 until the formal establishment of the Weimar Republic in August 1919. \n The roots of the revolution lie in the German Empire \'s fate in the First World War and the social tensions which came to a head shortly thereafter. The first acts of revolution were triggered by the policy of the Supreme Command and its lack of coordination with the Naval Command which, in the face of defeat, nevertheless insisted on engaging in a climactic battle with the British Royal Navy . The Wilhelmshaven mutiny (a sailors\' revolt) ensued in the naval ports of Wilhelmshaven and Kiel , and the spirit of rebellion spread across the country and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918. Shortly thereafter Emperor Wilhelm II abdicated. \n The revolutionaries, inspired by communist ideas, failed to hand power to soviets as the Bolsheviks had in Russia , because the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) leadership refused to work with those who supported the Bolsheviks. Furthermore, fearing an all-out civil war in Germany between the communists and the reactionary conservatives, the SPD did not plan to completely strip the old imperial elites of their power and instead sought to integrate them into the new social democratic system. In this endeavour, SPD leftists sought an alliance with the Supreme Command. The army and Freikorps ( nationalist militias) quelled the Spartacist uprising by force. The political fragmentation among the left wing was a significant factor in the failure of the left to seize power. \n The revolution ended officially on 11 August 1919, when the Weimar Constitution was adopted. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Background \n \n 1.1 SPD and World War I \n 1.2 Split of the SPD \n 1.3 Impact of the Russian Revolution \n 1.4 Leftist and rightist approaches to peace \n 1.5 Request for cease fire and change of Constitution \n 1.6 Third Wilson note and Ludendorff\'s dismissal \n \n \n 2 Revolution \n \n 2.1 Sailors\' revolt \n 2.2 Spread of revolution to the whole Empire \n 2.3 Reactions in Berlin \n 2.4 9 November 1918: Two proclamations of a republic \n 2.5 10 November: SPD leadership in opposition to revolutionary shop stewards.

With 28% of the vote and 112 seats in the Reichstag in 1912 the Social Democrats had grown into the largest political party in Germany. Party membership was around 1 million and the party press ( Vorw\xc3\xa4rts ) alone had 1.5 million subscribers. The trade unions had 2.5 million members, most of whom probably supported the Social Democrats. In addition, there were numerous co-operative societies (for example, apartment co-ops, shop co-ops, etc.), cultural and other associations directly linked to the SPD, to the unions or adhered along Social Democratic lines. Other noteworthy parties in the Reichstag of 1912 were the Catholic Centre Party (91), the Conservatives (57), the National Liberals (45) and Progressive People\'s Party (42), the Poles (18) and the Alsatians (9). \n At the European congresses of the second Socialist International , the Social Democratic Party (SPD) had always agreed to resolutions asking for combined action of Socialists in case of a war. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo , the SPD \xe2\x80\x94 like other socialist parties in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 organized anti-war demonstrations during the July Crisis . After Rosa Luxemburg , representing the left wing of the party, had called for disobedience and rejection of the war in the name of the entire party, the Imperial government planned to arrest the party leaders immediately at the onset of war. Friedrich Ebert , one of the two party leaders since 1913, traveled to Z\xc3\xbcrich with Otto Braun in order to save the party\'s funds from being confiscated. \n After Germany declared war on the Russian Empire on 1 August 1914, the majority of the SPD-newspapers initially shared the general enthusiasm for the war, particularly because they viewed the Russian Empire as the most reactionary, anti-socialist power. In the first days of August, the editors believed themselves to be in line with the late August Bebel who had died the previous year. In 1904 he had declared in the Reichstag that the SPD would support an armed defense of Germany against a foreign attack. In 1907 at a party convention in Essen he assured that he himself would "shoulder the gun" if it was to fight against Russia, the "enemy of all culture and all the suppressed". [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] In the face of the general enthusiasm for the war among the population, which believed in an attack by the Entente powers, many SPD deputies worried they might lose many of their voters with their consistent pacifism . In addition, the government of Imperial Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg threatened to outlaw all parties in case of war. On the other hand, the chancellor cleverly exploited the anti-tsarist stance of the SPD to procure the party\'s approval for the war. \n The party leadership and the party\'s deputies were split on the issue of support for the war: 96 deputies including Friedrich Ebert approved the war bonds demanded by the imperial government. 14 deputies headed by the second party leader, Hugo Haase , spoke out against the bonds but nevertheless followed party voting instructions and raised their hands in favour. \n Thus, the whole SPD-faction in the Reichstag voted in favour of the war bonds on August 4. Two days earlier the Free Unions had already agreed to refrain from labour strikes and demands for higher wages for the duration of the war. It was with these decisions by the Party and the Unions that the full mobilization of the German army became possible. Haase explained this decision against his will with the words: "We will not let the fatherland alone in the hour of need!". The Emperor welcomed the so-called "truce" ( German : Burgfrieden ), declaring: " Ich kenne keine Parteien mehr, ich kenne nur noch Deutsche! " ("I know no more parties, I know only Germans!"). [ 3 ] \n Even Karl Liebknecht , who became one of the most outspoken opponents of the war, initially followed the party line: he abstained from voting to not defy his own faction. But a few days later he joined the Gruppe Internationale (Group International) which Rosa Luxemburg had founded on 5 August 1914 with Franz Mehring , Wilhelm Pieck and four others from the left wing of the party, adhering to the pre-war resolutions of the SPD. From this group emerged the Spartacus League ( Spartakusbund ) on 1 January 1916. As of 2 December 1914 and initially the only deputy of the Reichstag, Liebknecht voted against further war bonds. Although he was not permitted to present his speech connected with this vote, it was made public through the circulation of an illegal leaflet: \n \n The present war was not willed by any of the nations participating in it and it is not waged in the interest of the Germans or any other people. It is an imperialist war, a war for capitalist control of the world market, for the political domination of huge territories and to give scope to industrial and banking capital. \n \n Because of high demand this leaflet was soon printed and evolved into the so-called "Political Letters" ( German : Politischen Briefe ), the collections of which afterward were illegally published under the name "Spartacus Letters" ( Spartakusbriefe ). As of December 1916, these were replaced by the journal "Spartakus", which appeared irregularly until November 1918. \n This open opposition against the party line put Liebknecht at odds even with those party members around Haase who actually were against the war bonds themselves. At the instigation of the SPD party leadership, Liebknecht was drafted in February 1915 for military service in order to dispose of him \xe2\x80\x94 the only SPD deputy to get drafted. Because of his attempts to organize objectors of the war, he was expelled from the SPD, and in June 1916, he was sentenced on a charge of high treason to four years in prison. While he was in the army, Rosa Luxemburg wrote most of the Spartacus Letters. After having served a prison sentence, she was put back in jail under "preventive detention" until the war ended. \n [ edit ] Split of the SPD \n As the war went on and the losses of human life rose week by week, SPD members began to question the adherence to the Burgfrieden ("truce") of 1914; also, from 1916, the guidelines of German policy were de facto set not by the Emperor and the Imperial Government but by the Supreme Army Command ( German : Oberste Heeresleitung ) under the generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff . Power in Germany had always been in the hands of the Supreme Army Command and it was Ludendorff who made the important decisions. The generals persisted, even after the dismissal of Falkenhyn, with strategies aimed at achieving a military victory, pursued expansionist and offensive war goals and subjugated civil life to the needs of the war and the war economy. For the labor force, this meant (among other things) 12 hour work days at minimal wages with inadequate food. The expression "total war", used by the Nazi propaganda minister in 1942, could well have been applied to the situation in Germany in 1916-18. \n After the outbreak of the Russian February Revolution in 1917, the first organized strikes erupted in German armament factories in March and April that year with about 300,000 participating workers. The United States entry into the war on 6 April 1917 threatened further deterioration. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had called for an end to the moratorium on attacks on neutral shipping in the Atlantic, which had been imposed when the Lusitania , a British ship carrying US citizens (and a large cargo of war material) was sunk off Ireland in 1915. Now the strategy was to stop the flow of US mat\xc3\xa9riel to France in order to make a German victory (or a peace settlement on German terms) possible before the United States entered the war as a combatant. The Emperor tried to appease the population in his Easter address of 7 April. He promised democratic elections in Prussia, where the three-class franchise system was still in force, after the war. Essentially the war continued, even if fighting on the eastern front became more sporadic as the tsarist forces collapsed and the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk robbed Russia of most of its industrial resources. Opposition to the war among munitions workers continued to rise and what had been a united front in favour of the war split into two sharply divided groups. [ 4 ] \n After the SPD leadership under Friedrich Ebert had excluded the opponents of the war from party ranks, the Spartacists joined with so-called "Revisionists" like Eduard Bernstein and Centrists like Karl Kautsky to found the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) under the leadership of Hugo Haase on 9 April 1917. \n The SPD, also called "MSPD" (Majority Social Democrats), was led by Friedrich Ebert. The USPD demanded an immediate end to the war and a further democratization of Germany, but did not have a unified agenda for social policies. The Spartacus League, which until then had opposed a split of the party, now made up the left wing of the USPD. Both the USPD and the Spartacists continued their anti-war propaganda in factories, especially in the armament plants. \n [ edit ] Impact of the Russian Revolution \n Further information: Russian Revolution \n After the February Revolution in Russia and the toppling of the last Emperor of Russia , Nicholas II , on 15 March 1917, the Russian Provisional Government , since summer led by Alexander Kerensky , continued the war on the side of the Entente powers. Nevertheless, the German Imperial Government now saw one more chance for victory. To support the anti war sentiment in Russia, it let the leader of the Russian Bolsheviks , Vladimir Lenin , pass in a sealed train wagon from his exile in Switzerland through Germany, Sweden and Finland to Petrograd . \n In the Russian Empire, the Bolsheviks had demanded an immediate end to the war and seized power in the October Revolution . The success of the Russian proletariat and peasantry in overthrowing their ruling classes raised fears among the German bourgeoisie that such a revolution could take place in Germany. The moderate SPD leadership also noted that a determined and well managed group such as the Bolsheviks might well try to seize power in Germany and this determined their behavior towards the left during the German Revolution. \n Otto Braun, board member of the SPD and later prime minister of Prussia , clarified the position of his party in a leading article in the SPD newspaper Vorw\xc3\xa4rts under the title "The Bolsheviks and Us": \n \n Socialism cannot be erected on bayonets and machine guns. If it is to last, it must be realized with democratic means. Therefore of course it is a necessary prerequisite that the economic and social conditions for socializing society are ripe. If this was the case in Russia, the Bolsheviks no doubt could rely on the majority of the people. As this is not the case, they established a reign of the sword that could not have been more brutal and reckless under the disgraceful regime of the Tzar. [...] Therefore we must draw a thick, visible dividing line between us and the Bolsheviks. [ 5 ] \n \n In the same month in which Otto Braun\'s article appeared, another series of strikes swept through the country (January Strikes) with the participation of over 1 million workers. For the first time during these strikes, the so-called "Revolutionary Stewards" ( Revolution\xc3\xa4re Obleute ) took action. They were to play an important part in further developments. They called themselves " Councils " ( R\xc3\xa4te ) after the Russian " Soviets ". In order to weaken their influence, Ebert joined the Berlin strike leadership and achieved an early termination of the strike. \n On 3 March 1918, the newly established Soviet government agreed to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk negotiated with the Germans by Leon Trotsky . This settlement arguably contained harsher terms for the Russians than the later Treaty of Versailles demanded of the Germans. The Supreme Command could now move part of the eastern armies to the western front. Most Germans believed that victory in the west was also at hand. \n [ edit ] Leftist and rightist approaches to peace \n After the United States had entered the war, the situation on the western front became more precarious for the Germans. For that reason, and also to take the wind out of the USPD\'s sails, the SPD in the Reichstag joined the "Interfractional Committee" with the Catholic Centre Party and the Progressive People\'s Party . In Summer 1917, these three parties passed a peace resolution providing for a peace through rapprochement without annexations and payments, as opposed to a peace through victory and annexations, as the political right was demanding. Along with everyone else in the country, the committee still believed in victory. The Supreme Army Command did not like this resolution, and in the negotiations from December 1917 to March 1918 imposed a peace by victory upon Russia. \n The Supreme Command also rejected outright the " Fourteen Points " set out by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson on January 8, 1918. Wilson wanted peace on the basis of "self-determination of peoples" without victors or conquered. Hindenburg and Ludendorff rejected the offer, because, after victory over Russia, they again believed themselves to be in a stronger position. They continued to bet on a "peace through victory" with far-reaching annexations at the expense of Germany\'s enemies. \n [ edit ] Request for cease fire and change of Constitution \n After the victory in the east the Supreme Army Command ordered the so-called Spring Offensive in the west to turn the war decisively in Germany\'s favour. But by July 1918 their last reserves were used up, and military defeat of Germany was sealed. Allied forces scored numerous successive victories in the Hundred Days Offensive , gaining a large swathe of territory. In mid-September, the Balkan Front collapsed. The Kingdom of Bulgaria , an ally of the German Empire and Austria-Hungary , capitulated on 27 September. The collapse of Austria-Hungary itself was now only a matter of days away. \n On 29 September, the Supreme Army Command informed Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor , Count Georg von Hertling , at army headquarters in Spa, Belgium that the military situation was hopeless. Ludendorff, probably fearing a breakthrough, said that he could not guarantee to hold the front for another 24 hours and demanded that a request be given to the Entente for an immediate cease fire . In addition, he recommended the acceptance of the main demand of US President Wilson to put the Imperial Government on a democratic footing, hoping for more favourable peace terms. This enabled him to save the face of the Imperial Army and put the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences squarely in the hands of the democratic parties and the parliament. As he said to his staff officers on 1 October: They now must lie on the bed that they have made us." [ 6 ]  \n Thus the so-called " Stab-in-the-back legend " ( German : Dolchsto\xc3\x9flegende ) was born, according to which the revolutionaries had attacked the undefeated army from the rear, and turned the almost certain victory into a defeat. Ludendorff, who intended to cover up his own failure, contributed considerably to this grave distortion and falsification of history. It was very important that the Imperial Government and the German Army shirked their responsibility for defeat from the very beginning, and blamed the new democratic government. The motivation behind this is verified by the following citation in the autobiography of Groener, Ludendorff\'s successor: \n \n It was just fine with me when Army and Army Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected. [ 7 ] \n \n In nationalist circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. The Nationalists soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted a revolution and did everything to prevent it, as "November Criminals" ( Novemberverbrecher ). The radical right did not even stop at political assassinations, e.g. Matthias Erzberger and Walter Rathenau . In Hitler\'s attempted coup in 1923 together with Ludendorff, they deliberately chose the heavily symbolic date of 9 November. In his later ascent to power, Hitler, who had served in the Imperial German Army as a corporal, cunningly exploited the sentiments of the homecomers who felt betrayed not only by the new democratic government but also by their commanders who had sent them to useless slaughter, especially in the Battle of Verdun . \n Although shocked by Ludendorff\'s report and the news of the defeat, the majority parties in the Reichstag, and especially the SPD, were willing to take on the responsibility of government at the eleventh hour. As the convinced royalist Hertling objected to handing over the reins to the Reichstag, on 3 October Emperor Wilhelm II appointed Prince Maximilian of Baden as the new Imperial Chancellor. The Prince was considered a liberal yet at the same time a representative of the royal family. In his cabinet, Social Democrats took on responsibility. The most prominent and highest-ranking was Philipp Scheidemann as under-secretary without portfolio. The following day, the new government offered to the allies the truce which Ludendorff had demanded. \n It was only on 5 October that the German public was informed of the dismal situation. In the general state of shock about the defeat, which now had become obvious, the constitutional changes, formally decided by the Reichstag on 28 October, went almost unnoticed. From then on, the Imperial Chancellor and the Ministers depended on the confidence of the parliamentary majority. After the supreme command had passed from the Emperor to the Imperial Government, the German Empire changed from a constitutional to a parliamentary monarchy . As far as the Social Democrats were concerned, the so-called October Constitution met all the important constitutional objectives of the party. Ebert already regarded 5 October as the birthday of German democracy, after the Emperor voluntarily ceded power, and thus considered a revolution as unnecessary. \n [ edit ] Third Wilson note and Ludendorff\'s dismissal \n In the following three weeks, American President Woodrow Wilson responded to the request for a truce with three diplomatic notes. As a precondition for negotiations he demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and \xe2\x80\x93 in between lines [ clarification needed ] \xe2\x80\x93 the Emperor\'s abdication. This last was to render the process of democratization irreversible. \n After the third Wilson Note of 24 October, General Ludendorff suddenly changed his mind and declared the conditions of the allies to be unacceptable. He now demanded the resumption of the war which he himself had declared lost only one month earlier. While this request for a truce was being processed, the allies realized Germany\'s military weakness. The German troops had come to expect the war to end and were anxious to return home. They were scarcely willing to fight more battles, and desertions were on the increase. \n So the Imperial Government stayed on course and replaced Ludendorff as First General Quartermaster with General Wilhelm Groener . Ludendorff fled with false papers to neutral Sweden. On 5 November, the Entente Powers agreed to take up negotiations for a truce. But after the third Wilson Note, many soldiers and the general population believed that Emperor Wilhelm II had to abdicate in order to achieve peace. \n [ edit ] Revolution \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Libertarian socialism \n \n \n \n \n Concepts \n \n \n \n Anti-authoritarianism \n Anti-capitalism \n Anti-consumerism \n Anti-Leninism \n Anti-Stalinist left \n Anti-statism \n Consensus democracy \n Common ownership \n Commons \n Commune \n Decentralization \n Decentralized planning \n Direct democracy \n Dual power \n Class struggle \n Economic democracy \n Egalitarian community \n Free association \n Free love \n Free school \n Free store \n Mass strike \n Guilds \n Libertarian municipalism \n Mutual aid \n Prefigurative politics \n State capitalism \n Stateless society \n Social center \n Ultra-leftism \n Use value \n Wage slavery \n Workers\' control \n Worker cooperative \n Workers\' council \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Models \n \n \n \n Gift economy \n Communalism \n Communization \n Economic democracy \n Guild socialism \n Inclusive Democracy \n Participatory economics \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Gerrard Winstanley \n Charles Fourier \n Josiah Warren \n Pierre-Joseph Proudhon \n Joseph D\xc3\xa9jacque \n Mikhail Bakunin \n Louise Michel \n Peter Kropotkin \n William Morris \n Oscar Wilde \n Benjamin Tucker \n Errico Malatesta \n Leo Tolstoy \n Emma Goldman \n G.

The mutinous sailors had no intention of risking their lives near the end of the war, thinking it futile. They were also convinced that the credibility of the new democratic government which was seeking peace would have been compromised by a simultaneous naval attack. (However, The New York Times attributed the German navy revolution partly to the German navy having remained on the defensive during the war. [ 9 ] ) \n The sailors\' revolt started in the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven , where the German fleet had anchored in expectation of battle. During the night of 29\xe2\x80\x9330 October 1918 some crews refused to obey orders. Sailors on board three ships of the Third Navy Squadron refused to weigh anchor. Part of the crew of SMS&#160; Th\xc3\xbcringen and SMS&#160; Helgoland , two battle ships of the First Navy Squadron, committed outright mutiny and sabotage. However, when a day later some torpedo boats directed their cannons onto these ships, the mutineers gave up and were led away without any resistance. But the Naval Command had to drop its plans as it was felt that the crew\'s loyalty could not be relied upon any more. The Third Navy Squadron was ordered back to Kiel. \n The squadron commander Vice-Admiral Kraft carried out a manoeuvre with his battleships in Heligoland Bight. This "worked perfectly" ( tadellos funktionierte ), and he believed that he had regained control of his crews. While moving through the Kiel Canal he had 47 of the crew of the SMS&#160; Markgraf , who were seen as the ringleaders, imprisoned. In Holtenau (the end of the canal in Kiel) they were taken to the Arrestanstalt (military prison) in Kiel and to Fort Herwarth in the north of Kiel. \n The sailors and stokers were now pulling out all the stops to prevent the fleet setting sail again and to achieve the release of their comrades. Some 250 met in the evening of 1 November in the Union House in Kiel. Delegations sent to their officers, requesting the mutineers\' release, were not heard. The sailors were now looking for closer ties to the unions, the USPD and the SPD. Thereupon the Union House was closed by police, leading to an even larger joint open air meeting on 2 November. Led by the sailor Karl Artelt , who worked in the torpedo workshop in Kiel-Friedrichsort, and by the mobilized shipyard worker Lothar Popp , both USPD members, the sailors called for a mass meeting the following day at the same place ( Gro\xc3\x9fer Exerzierplatz , large drill ground). \n This call was heeded by several thousand people on the afternoon of 3 November with workers\' representatives also present. The slogan "Peace and Bread" ( Frieden und Brot ) was raised showing that the sailors and workers demanded not only the release of the prisoners but also the end of the war and the improvement of food provisions. Eventually, the people supported Artelt\'s call to free the prisoners, and they moved towards the military prison. Sub-Lieutenant Steinh\xc3\xa4user, in order to stop the demonstrators, ordered his patrol to fire warning shots and then to shoot directly into the demonstration. Seven people were killed and 29 severely injured. Some demonstrators also opened fire. Steinh\xc3\xa4user was severely injured by rifle-butt blows and shots, but contrary to later statements, he was not killed. [ 10 ] After this eruption the demonstrators as well as the patrol dispersed. Nevertheless the mass protest turned into a general revolt. \n On the morning of 4 November groups of mutineers moved through the town. Sailors in a large barracks compound in a northern district of Kiel mutinied: after a divisional inspection by the commander spontaneous demonstrations took place. Karl Artelt organized the first soldiers\' council, and soon many more were set up. The governor of the naval station, Wilhelm Souchon , was compelled to negotiate. \n The imprisoned sailors and stokers were freed. Soldiers and workers brought public and military institutions under their control. In breach of Souchon\'s promise, separate troops advanced to end the rebellion, but they were intercepted by the mutineers and either sent back or decided to join the sailors and workers. By the evening of 4 November, Kiel was firmly in the hands of about 40,000 rebellious sailors, soldiers and workers, as was Wilhelmshaven two days later. \n On the same evening the SPD deputy Gustav Noske arrived in Kiel and was welcomed enthusiastically, although he had orders from the new government and the SPD leadership to bring the uprising under control. He had himself elected chairman of the soldiers\' council and reinstated peace and order. Some days later he took over the governor\'s post, while Lothar Popp of the USPD became chairman of the overall soldiers\' council. During the following weeks Noske succeeded in reducing the influence of the councils in Kiel, but he could not prevent the spread of the revolution throughout Germany. The events had already spread far beyond the city limits. \n [ edit ] Spread of revolution to the whole Empire \n Around 4 November delegations of the sailors dispersed to all of the country\'s big cities. By 7 November the revolution had seized all large coastal cities as well as Hanover , Brunswick , Frankfurt on Main and Munich . In Munich a "Workers\' and Soldiers\' Council" forced the last King of Bavaria , Ludwig III , to abdicate. Bavaria was the first member state of the German Empire to be declared a Council Republic ( German : R\xc3\xa4terepublik ), the Bavarian Soviet Republic , by Kurt Eisner of the USPD. In the following days the royal rulers of all the other German states abdicated; the last was Prince G\xc3\xbcnther Victor of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt , on 23 November. The Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils were almost entirely made up of SPD and USPD members. Their program was democracy, pacifism and anti-militarism. Apart from the royal families they deprived only the hitherto almighty military commands of power. The Imperial civilian administration and office bearers such as police, municipal administrations and courts remained unscathed. There were also hardly any confiscations of property or occupations of factories because such measures were expected from the new government. In order to create an executive committed to the revolution and to the future government, the councils for the moment claimed only to take over the supervision of the administration from the military commands. Thus, the SPD was able to establish a firm base on the local level. But while the councils believed they were acting in the interest of the new order, the party leaders of the SPD regarded the councils as disturbing elements for a peaceful changeover of power [ clarification needed ] , which they imagined already to have taken place. Along with the middle-class parties they demanded speedy elections for a national assembly which was to make the final decision on the constitution of the new state. This soon brought the SPD into opposition with many of the revolutionaries. It was especially the USPD that took over [ clarification needed ] their demands, one of which was to delay elections as long as possible to try to achieve a fait accompli that met the expectations of a large part of the workforce. \n [ edit ] Reactions in Berlin \n Ebert agreed with Prince Max that a social revolution was to be prevented and that state order must be upheld at all costs. In the restructuring of the state, Ebert wanted to win over the middle-class parties, which had already cooperated with the SPD in the Reichstag in 1917, as well as the old elites of the Empire. He wanted to avoid the spectre of radicalization of the revolution along Russian lines and he also worried that the precarious supply situation could collapse, leading to the takeover of the administration by inexperienced revolutionaries. He was certain that the SPD would be able to implement its reform plans due to its parliamentary majorities in the future. \n Ebert did his best to act in agreement with the old powers, and intended to save the monarchy. In order to demonstrate some success to his followers he demanded the abdication of the Kaiser as of 6 November. But Wilhelm II, still in his headquarters in Spa, was playing for time. After the Entente had agreed to truce negotiations on that day he hoped to return to Germany at the head of the army and to quell the revolution by force. \n According to notes taken by Prince Max, Ebert declared on 7 November: "If the Kaiser does not abdicate, the social revolution is unavoidable. But I do not want it, indeed I hate it like sin." ( Wenn der Kaiser nicht abdankt, dann ist die soziale Revolution unvermeidlich. Ich aber will sie nicht, ja, ich hasse sie wie die S\xc3\xbcnde. ) [ 11 ] The Chancellor planned to travel to Spa and personally convince the Kaiser of the necessity to abdicate. But this plan was overtaken by the rapidly deteriorating situation in Berlin. \n [ edit ] 9 November 1918: Two proclamations of a republic \n In order to remain master of the situation, in the afternoon of 9 November Friedrich Ebert demanded the chancellorship for himself. \n The news of the Kaiser\'s abdication came too late to make any impression on the demonstrators. Nobody heeded the public appeals. More and more demonstrators demanded the total abolition of the monarchy. Karl Liebknecht, just released from prison, had returned to Berlin and re-founded the Spartacist League the previous day. At lunch in the Reichstag the SPD deputy chairman Philipp Scheidemann learned that Liebknecht planned the proclamation of a Socialist Republic . Scheidemann did not want to leave the initiative to the Spartacists and without further ado stepped out onto a balcony of the Reichstag. From there he proclaimed on his own authority - and against Ebert\'s expressed will - a republic before a mass of demonstrating people. A few hours later the Berlin newspapers published that in the Berlin Lustgarten - at probably around the same time \xe2\x80\x94 Liebknecht had proclaimed a Socialist Republic, which he affirmed from a balcony of the Berlin Royal Residence to an assembled crowd at around 4 pm. \n At that time Karl Liebknecht\'s intentions were little known to the public. The Spartacist League\'s demands of 7 October for a far-reaching restructuring of the economy, the army and the judiciary \xe2\x80\x93 inter alia by abolishing the death penalty\xe2\x80\x94had not yet been publicized. The biggest bone of contention with the SPD was to be the Spartacist\'s demand for the establishment of "unalterable political facts" on the ground by social and other measures before the election of a constituent assembly, while the SPD wanted to leave the decision on the future economic system to the assembly. \n Ebert was faced with a dilemma. The first proclamation he had issued on 9 November was addressed "To the citizens of Germany". \n Ebert wanted to take the sting out of the revolutionary mood and to meet the demands of the demonstrators for the unity of the labour parties. He offered the USPD participation in the government and was ready to accept Liebknecht as a minister. Liebknecht in turn demanded the control of the workers\' councils over the army. As USPD chairman Hugo Haase was in Kiel and the deliberations went on the USPD deputies were unable to reach a decision that day. \n Neither the early announcement of the Kaiser\'s abdication by Prince Max and Ebert\'s chancellorship, nor Scheidemann\'s proclamation of the Republic were covered by the constitution. These were all revolutionary actions by protagonists who did not want a revolution but nevertheless took action. However, a real revolutionary action took place the same evening which later proved to have been in vain. \n Around 8 p.m. a group of 100 Revolutionary Stewards ( Revolution\xc3\xa4re Obleute ) from the larger Berlin factories occupied the Reichstag. Led by their spokesmen Richard M\xc3\xbcller and Emil Barth they formed a Revolutionary Parliament. Most of the participating stewards had already been leaders during the January strikes. They did not trust the SPD leadership and had planned a coup independently from the sailors\' revolt for 11 November but were surprised by the revolutionary events since Kiel. In order to snatch the initiative from Ebert they now decided to announce elections for the following day: on that Sunday every Berlin factory and every regiment was to elect workers\' and soldiers\' councils which were then in turn to elect a revolutionary government from members of the 2 labour parties (SPD and USPD). This Council of the People\'s Deputies ( Rat der Volksbeauftragten ) was to execute the resolutions of the Revolutionary Parliament as the revolutionaries intended and to replace Ebert\'s function as chancellor and president. \n [ edit ] 10 November: SPD leadership in opposition to revolutionary shop stewards. Armistice \n The same evening the SPD leadership heard of these plans. As the elections and the following councils\' meeting could not be prevented Ebert sent speakers to all Berlin regiments and into the factories in the same night and the early following morning. They were to influence the elections in his favour and announce the intended participation of the USPD in the government. \n In turn, these activities did not escape the attention of Richard M\xc3\xbcller and the revolutionary shop stewards. [ 12 ] Seeing that Ebert would also play the tune in the new government, they planned to propose to the assembly not only the election of a government but also the appointment of an Action Committee. This committee was to co-ordinate the activities of the Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils. For this election the Stewards had already prepared a list of names on which the SPD was not represented. In this manner they hoped to install a monitoring body acceptable to them watching the government. \n In the assembly that convened on 10 November in the Circus Busch the majority stood on the side of the SPD: almost all Soldiers\' Councils and a large part of the workers representatives. They repeated the demand for the "Unity of the Working Class" which had been put forward by the revolutionaries the previous day and now used this motto in order to push through Ebert\'s line. As planned, three members of each socialist party were elected into the "Council of People\'s Representatives", from the USPD, their chairman Hugo Haase , the deputy Wilhelm Dittmann and Emil Barth for the Revolutionary Stewards; from the SPD Ebert, Scheidemann and the Magdeburg deputy Otto Landsberg . \n The proposal by the shop stewards to additionally elect an Action Committee took the SPD leadership by surprise and started heated debates. Ebert finally succeeded in also having this 24-member "Executive Council of Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils" equally filled with SPD and USPD members. The Executive Council was chaired by Richard M\xc3\xbcller (USPD) and Brutus Molkenbuhr. In theory, the Executive Council was the highest-ranking council of the revolutionary regime and therefore M\xc3\xbcller the head of state of the new declared "Socialist Republic of Germany". But in practice the council\'s initiative was blocked by internal power-struggles. The Executive Council decided to summon an "Imperial Council Convention" in December to Berlin. \n Although Ebert had saved the decisive part of the SPD he was not happy with the results. He regarded the Council Parliament and the Executive Council not as helpful but only as an obstacle on the way to a new system of government with a smooth transition from the Empire. The whole SPD leadership mistrusted the councils rather than the old elites in army and administration. They considerably overestimated the old elite\'s loyalty to the new republic. What bothered Ebert most was that now in front of the Councils he could not act as Chancellor but only as chairman of a revolutionary government. Indeed, conservatives regarded him as a traitor although he had taken the lead of the revolution only in order to stop it. \n In the 8 weeks of double rule of Councils and Imperial Government the latter always was dominant. The whole higher level administration reported only to Ebert, although Haase formally was a chairman in the Council with equal rights. Concerning the question of real power, there was a phone call on the evening of 10 November between Ebert and General Wilhelm Groener , the new First General Quartermaster in Spa, Belgium . Assuring Ebert of the support of the Army, the General was given Ebert\'s promise to reinstate the military hierarchy and, with the help of the army, to take action against the Councils. \n Behind the secret Ebert-Groener pact stood the SPD\'s worry that the revolution could end in a Council (Soviet) Republic following the Russian example. However, this pact was not able to win over the Imperial Officer Corps for the republic. As Ebert\'s behaviour became increasingly puzzling to the revolutionary workers, the soldiers and their stewards, the SPD leadership lost more and more confidence of its supporters without gaining any sympathies from the opponents of the revolution on the right. \n In the turmoil of this day, the Ebert government\'s acceptance of the harsh terms of the Entente for a truce, after a renewed demand by the Supreme Command, went almost unnoticed. On 11 November, the Centre Party deputy Matthias Erzberger , on behalf of Berlin, signed the armistice agreement in Compi\xc3\xa8gne , France. Thus, World War I had come to an end. \n [ edit ] Stinnes-Legien-Agreement \n The revolutionaries disagreed among themselves about the future economic and state system. Both SPD and USPD favoured placing at least heavy industry under democratic control. The left wings of both parties and the Revolutionary Stewards wanted to go beyond that and establish a "direct democracy" in the production sector, with elected delegates controlling the political power. It was not only in the interest of the SPD to prevent a Council Democracy, even the unions would have been rendered superfluous by the councils. \n To prevent this development, the union leaders under Carl Legien and the representatives of big industry under Hugo Stinnes and Carl Friedrich von Siemens met in Berlin from 9 to 12 November. On 15 November they signed an agreement with advantages for both sides: the union representatives promised to guarantee orderly production, to end wild strikes, to drive back the influence of the councils and to prevent a nationalisation of means of production. For their part, the employers guaranteed to introduce the eight hour day , which the workers had demanded in vain for years. The employers agreed to the union claim of sole representation and to the lasting recognition of the unions instead of the Councils. Both parties formed a "Central Committee for the Maintenance of the Economy" (Zentralausschuss f\xc3\xbcr die Aufrechterhaltung der Wirtschaft). \n An "Arbitration Committee" (Schlichtungsausschuss) was to mediate in future conflicts between employers and unions. From now on, in every factory with more than 50 employees committees together with the management were to monitor the keeping to the wage settlements. \n With this, the unions had achieved one of their longtime demands but undermined all efforts for nationalising means of production and largely eliminated the Councils. \n [ edit ] Interim government and council movement \n The Reichstag had not been summoned since 9 November. The Council of the People\'s Deputies and the Executive Council had replaced the old government. But the previous administrative machinery remained unchanged. Imperial servants had only representatives of SPD and USPD assigned to them. These servants all kept their positions and continued to do their work in most parts unchanged. \n On 12 November the Council of People\'s Representatives published its democratic and social government programme. It lifted the state of siege and censorship, abolished the "Gesindeordnung" (Servant Rules: rules governing relations between servant and master) and introduced universal suffrage from 20 years up, for the first time for women. There was an amnesty for all political prisoners. Regulations for the freedom of association, assembly and press were enacted. The eight-hour day became statutory on the basis of the Stinnes-Legien Agreement, and benefits for unemployment, social insurance, and workers\' compensation were expanded. \n At the insistence of USPD representatives the Council of People\'s Representatives appointed a "Nationalisation Committee", among others with Karl Kautsky , Rudolf Hilferding and Otto Hue . This committee was to examine which industries were "fit" for nationalisation and to prepare the nationalisation of the coal and steel industry. It sat until 7 April 1919, without any tangible result. "Self-Administration Bodies" were installed only in coal and potash mining and in the steel industry. From these bodies emerged the modern German Works or Factory Committees. Socialist expropriations were not initiated. \n The SPD leadership worked with the old administration rather than with the new Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils, because it considered them incapable of properly supplying the needs of the population. As of mid-November this caused continuing strife with the Executive Council. As the Council continuously changed its position following whoever it just happened to represent, Ebert withdrew more and more responsibilities planning to end the "meddling and interfering" of the Councils in Germany for good. But Ebert and the SPD leadership by far overestimated the power not only of the Council Movement but also of the Spartacist League. The Spartacist League, for example, never had control over the Council Movement as the conservatives and parts of the SPD believed. \n In Leipzig , Hamburg , Bremen , Chemnitz and Gotha the Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils put the city administrations under their control. In addition, in Brunswick , D\xc3\xbcsseldorf , M\xc3\xbclheim/Ruhr and Zwickau all civil servants loyal to the Kaiser were arrested. In Hamburg and Bremen "Red Guards" were formed that were to protect the revolution. The Councils deposed the management of the Leuna Works , a giant chemical factory near Merseburg . The new Councils were often appointed spontaneously and arbitrarily and had no management experience whatsoever. But a majority of Councils came to arrangements with the old administrations and saw to it that law and order were quickly restored. For example, Max Weber was part of the workers\' council of Heidelberg , and was pleasantly surprised that most members were moderate German liberals. The Councils took over the distribution of food, the police and the accommodation and provisions of the front-line soldiers that were gradually returning home. \n Administration and Councils depended on each other: the former had the knowledge and experience, the latter had political clout. In most cases SPD-members had been elected into the Councils who regarded their job as interim solution. For them as well as for the majority of the population in 1918/19 the introduction of a Council Republic was never an issue, but they were not even given a chance to think about it. Many wanted to support the new government and expected it to abolish militarism and the authoritarian state. Being weary of the war and hoping for a peaceful solution, they partially overestimated the revolutionary achievements. \n [ edit ] Imperial Council Convention \n As decided by the Executive Committee the Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils in the whole Empire sent deputies to Berlin who were to convene on 16 December in the Circus Busch for the "First General Convention of Workers\' and Soldiers\' Councils" (Erster Allgemeiner Kongress der Arbeiter- und Soldatenr\xc3\xa4te). On 15 December Ebert and General Groener had troops ordered to Berlin to prevent this convention and to regain control of the capital. On 16 December one of the regiments intended for this plan advanced too early. In the attempt to arrest the Executive Council the soldiers opened fire on a demonstration of unarmed "Red Guards" which were Soldiers\' Councils affiliated with the Spartacists, and killed 16 people. \n With this the potential for violence and the danger of a coup from the right already became visible. Because of this experience, in the daily newspaper of the Spartacist League "Red Flag" (Rote Fahne) of 12 December, Rosa Luxemburg demanded the peaceful disarmament of the homecoming military units by the Berlin workforce. She wanted the Soldiers\' Councils to be subordinated to the Revolutionary Parliament and the soldiers to become "re-educated". \n On 10 December Ebert welcomed ten divisions returning from the front hoping to use them against the Councils. As it turned out, these troops also were not willing to go on fighting. The war was over, Christmas was at the door and most of the soldiers just wanted to go home to their families. So shortly after their arrival in Berlin they dispersed. The blow against the Convention of Councils did not take place. \n This blow would have been unnecessary anyway because the convention that took up its work 16 December in the Prussian House of Representatives also consisted mainly of SPD followers. Not even Karl Liebknecht had managed to get a seat. The Spartacist League was not granted any influence. On 19 December the Councils voted 344 to 98 against the creation of a Council System as a basis for a new constitution. Instead, they supported the government\'s decision to call for elections for a constituent national assembly as soon as possible. This assembly was to decide upon the state system. \n The Convention disagreed with Ebert only on the issue of control of the army. The Convention was demanding a say for the Central Council which it would elect, in the supreme command of the army, the free election of officers and the disciplinary powers for the Soldiers\' Councils. That would have been contrary to the agreement between Ebert and General Groener. They both spared no effort to undo this decision. The Supreme Command which in the meantime had moved from Spa to Kassel , began to raise loyal volunteer corps (Freikorps) against the supposed Bolshevik menace. Unlike the revolutionary soldiers of November, these troops were monarchist-minded officers and men who feared the return into civil life. \n [ edit ] Christmas crisis \n \n \n \n  \nLeftist soldiers during Christmas fights in the Pfeilersaal of the Berlin City Palace \n \n \n After 9 November the government ordered the newly created People\'s Navy Division ( German : Volksmarinedivision ) from Kiel to Berlin for its protection and stationed it in the Royal Stables ( German : Neuer Marstell ) across from the Imperial City Residence . The Division was considered absolutely loyal and had indeed refused to participate in the coup attempt of 6 December. The sailors even deposed their commander because they saw him as involved in the affair. It was this loyalty that now gave them the reputation of being in favor of the Spartacists. Ebert demanded their disbanding and Otto Wels, as of 9 November the Commander of Berlin and in line with Ebert, refused the sailors\' pay. \n The dispute escalated on 23 December. After having been put off for days the sailors occupied the Imperial Chancellery itself, cut the phone lines, put the Council of People\'s Representatives under house arrest and captured Otto Wels. The sailors did not exploit the situation to eliminate the Ebert government, as could have been expected from Spartacist revolutionaries. Instead, they just insisted on their pay. Nevertheless, Ebert, who via a secret phone line was in touch with the Supreme Command in Kassel, gave orders to attack the Residence with troops loyal to the government on the morning of 24 December. The sailors repelled the attack under their commander Heinrich Dorrenbach, losing about 30 men and civilians in the fight. The government troops had to withdraw from the center of Berlin. They themselves were now disbanded and integrated into the newly formed Freikorps . To make up for the loss of face they temporarily occupied the editor\'s offices of the "Red Flag". But military power in Berlin once more was in the hands of the People\'s Navy Division. Again, the sailors did not take advantage of the situation. \n On one side this shows that the sailors were not Spartacists, on the other that the revolution had no guidance. Even if Liebknecht had been the revolutionary leader like Lenin, to which legend later made him, the sailors as well as the Councils would not have accepted him as such. Thus the only result of the Christmas Crisis, which the Spartacists named "Ebert\'s Bloody Christmas", was that the Revolutionary Stewards called for a demonstration on Christmas Day and the USPD left the government in protest on 29 December. They could not have done Ebert a bigger favor since he had let them participate only under the pressure of revolutionary events. Within a few days the military defeat of the Ebert government had turned into a political victory. \n [ edit ] Founding of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the January Revolt \n The Spartacists concluded after their experiences with the SPD and the USPD that their goals could be met only in a party of their own. Also because of the unhappiness of many workers with the course of the revolution and joined by other left-socialist groups of the whole Empire they founded the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). [ 13 ] \n Rosa Luxemburg drew up her founding programme and presented it on 31 December 1918. In this programme she pointed out that the communists could never take power without a clear will of the people in the majority. On 1 January she again demanded that the KPD participate in the planned elections but was outvoted. The majority still hoped to gain power by continued agitation in the factories and by the "pressure from the streets". After deliberations with the Spartacists the Revolutionary Stewards decided to remain in the USPD. This was a first defeat. \n \n \n \n  \nAfter occupation of the Silesian railway station in Berlin by government troops, 1919 \n \n \n The decisive defeat of the left was to be brought in the first days of the new year in 1919. As in November before, almost spontaneously, a second revolutionary wave developed which, this time, was violently suppressed. The wave was started when on 4 January the government dismissed the chief constable of Berlin, Emil Eichhorn, who was a member of the USPD and who had refused to act against the demonstrating workes in the Christmas Crisis resulting in the USPD, Revolutionary Stewards and the KPD chairmen Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck Eichhorn\'s calling for a demonstration to take place on the following day. To the surprise of the initiators the demonstration turned into an assembly of huge masses. On Sunday 5 January, as on 9 November 1918, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the centre of Berlin, many of them armed. In the afternoon the train stations and the newspaper district with the offices of the middle-class press and the "Vorw\xc3\xa4rts" were occupied. Some of the middle-class papers in the previous days had called not only for the raising of more Freikorps but also for the murder of the Spartacists. \n The demonstrators were mainly the same as two months previous. They now demanded the fulfillment of the hopes expressed in November. The Spartacists by no means had a leading position. The demands came straight from the workforce supported by various groups left of the SPD. The following so-called " Spartacist Uprising " originated only partially in the KPD. KPD members were even a minority among the insurgents. \n The initiators assembled at the Police Headquarters elected a 53-member "Interim Revolutionary Committee" (Provisorischer Revolutionsausschuss) which failed to make use of its power and was unable to give any clear direction. Liebknecht demanded the overthrow of the government and agreed with the majority of the committee that propagated the armed struggle. Rosa Luxemburg as well as the majority of KPD leaders thought a revolt at this moment to be a catastrophe and explicitly spoke out against it. \n \n \n \n  \nA British Mark IV tank , captured during the war, in use by Government troops. Berlin, January 1919 \n \n \n On the following day, 6 January, the Revolutionary Committee again called for a mass demonstration. This time even more people heeded the call. Again they carried placards and banners that said: "Brothers, don\'t shoot!" and remained waiting on an assembly square. A part of the Revolutionary Stewards armed themselves and called for the overthrow of the Ebert government. But the KPD-activists mostly failed in their endeavour to win over the troops. It turned out that even the units like the People\'s Navy Division were not willing to support the armed revolt, declaring itself neutral. The other regiments stationed in Berlin mostly remained loyal to the government. \n While on Ebert\'s orders more troops were moving into Berlin, he accepted an offer by the USPD to mediate between him and the Revolutionary Committee. After the advance of the troops into the city became known and an SPD-leaflet appeared saying: "The hour of reckoning is nigh" the Committee broke off further negotiations on 8 January. That was opportunity enough for Ebert to use the troops stationed in Berlin against the occupiers. Beginning 9 January they violently quelled an improvised revolt. In addition to that, on 12 January, the anti-republican Freikorps, which had been raised more or less as death squads since the beginning of December, moved into Berlin. Gustav Noske , who had been People\'s Representative for Army and Navy for a few days, accepted the premium command of these troops saying: "If you like, someone has to be the bloodhound. I won\'t shy away from the responsibility." [ 14 ] \n The Freikorps brutally cleared several buildings and executed the occupiers on the spot. Others soon surrendered, but some of them were still shot. The January revolt claimed 156 lives in Berlin. \n [ edit ] Murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg \n The alleged ringleaders of the January Revolt had to go into hiding and in spite of being urged by their allies refused to leave Berlin. On the evening of 15 January 1919 Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were discovered in a Berlin-Wilmersdorf apartment, arrested and handed over to the largest Freikorps, the heavily armed Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\xc3\xbctzen-Division. Their commander, Captain Waldemar Pabst , had them questioned. That same night both prisoners were beaten unconscious with rifle butts and shot in the head. Rosa Luxemburg\'s body was thrown into the Landwehr Canal running through Berlin, where it was found only on 1 July. Karl Liebknecht\'s body, without a name, was delivered to a morgue. \n The perpetrators for the most part went unpunished. The Nazis later compensated the few that had been tried or even jailed, and they merged the Gardekavallerie into the SA ( Sturmabteilung ). In an interview given to " Der Spiegel " in 1962 and in his memoirs Pabst maintained that he had talked on the phone with Noske in the Chancellery. [ 15 ] Noske and Ebert had approved of his actions. Pabst\'s statement was never confirmed, especially since neither parliament nor the courts had examined the case. \n After the murders of 15 January the opposition between SPD and KPD grew even more irreconcilable. In the following years in the Weimar Republic , both parties could not decide on joint action against the Nazis ( NSDAP ) which was growing in strength as of 1930. \n [ edit ] Further revolts in tow of the revolution \n \n \n \n  \nMarch 1919 Revolutionaries after summary execution \n \n \n In the first months of 1919 there were further armed revolts all over Germany. In some states Councils Republics were proclaimed and existed, most prominently in Bavaria ( Munich Soviet Republic ), even if only temporarily. \n These revolts were triggered by Noske\'s decision at the end of February to take armed action against the Council Republic of Bremen. In spite of an offer to negotiate he ordered his Freikorps units to invade the city. Approximately 400 people were killed in the ensuing fights. \n This caused an eruption of mass strikes in the Ruhr District, the Rhineland and in Saxony . Members of the USPD, the KPD and even the SPD called for a general strike which started on 4 March. Against the will of the strike leadership the strikes escalated into street fighting in Berlin. The Prussian state government, which in the meantime had declared a state of siege, called the Imperial government for help. Again Noske employed the Gardekavallerie-Sch\xc3\xbctzendivision commanded by Pabst against the strikers in Berlin. By the end of the fighting on 16 March they had killed approximately 1,200 people, many of them unarmed and uninvolved. Amongst others 29 members of the Peoples Navy Division, who had surrendered, were arbitrarily executed as Noske had ordered anybody found armed to be shot on the spot. \n The situation in Hamburg and Thuringia also was very much like a civil war. The Council Government holding out the longest was the Munich Soviet Republic . It was only on 2 May that Prussian and Wurttemberg Freikorps units put an end using the same violent methods as in Berlin and Bremen. \n According to modern predominating opinion of historians [ 16 ] the establishment of a Bolshevik-style council government on 9\xe2\x80\x9310 November was impossible. Yet the Ebert Government felt threatened by a coup from the left and co-operated with the Supreme Command and the Freikorps. The brutal actions of the Freikorps during the various revolts estranged many left democrats from the SPD. They, especially of course the USPD and the KPD, regard Ebert\'s, Noske\'s and the other SPD leader\'s behaviour during the revolution to this very day outright as betrayal against their own followers. \n [ edit ] National Assembly and New Imperial Constitution \n Main article: Weimar National Assembly \n On 19 January a Constituent National Assembly (Verfassungsgebende Nationalversammlung) was elected. Aside from SPD and USPD, the catholic Centre Party (Zentrumspartei) and several middle-class parties took part, which had established themselves since November: the left-liberal German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei DDP), the national-liberal German Peoples Party (Deutsche Volkspartei DVP) and the conservative, nationalist German National Peoples Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei DNVP). In spite of Rosa Luxemburg\'s recommendation, the KPD did not participate in these elections. \n The SPD became the strongest party in the Reichstag with 37.4% and 165 out of 423 deputies. The USPD received only 7.6% and sent 22 deputies into the parliament. The rating of the USPD temporarily went up one more time after the Kapp-L\xc3\xbcttwitz Putsch in 1920 but the party then dissolved in 1922. The Centre Party was runner-up to the SPD with 91 deputies, the DDP had 75, the DVP 19 and the DNVP 44. As a result, the SPD formed the so-called Weimar Coalition with the Centre Party and the DDP. To get away from the post-revolutionary confusion in Berlin the National Assembly met on 6 February in the town of Weimar, Thuringia, some 250&#160;km to the southwest of Berlin, where Friedrich Ebert was elected temporary Reich President on 11 February and Philipp Scheidemann was elected as Prime Minister (Ministerpr\xc3\xa4sident) of the newly formed coalition on 13 February. Ebert was then constitutionally sworn in as President ( Reichspr\xc3\xa4sident ) on 21 August 1919. \n On the one hand, the Weimar Constitution offered more possibilities of a direct democracy than the present German constitution , like for instance a referendum . On the other hand, Article 48 granted the President the authority to rule against the majority in the Parliament, with the help of the army if need be. In 1932\xe2\x80\x9333, article 48 was instrumental in destroying German democracy. [ 17 ] \n [ edit ] Aftermath \n Main article: Weimar Republic \n From 1920 to 1923, nationalist forces continued fighting against the Weimar Republic and left-wing political opponents. In 1920, the German government was briefly overthrown by a coup by Wolfgang Kapp in the Kapp Putsch and a nationalist government was briefly in power, until mass public demonstrations forced the short-lived regime out of power. In 1921 and 1922, Matthias Erzberger and Walter Rathenau were shot by members of the ultra-nationalist Organisation Consul . The newly formed National Socialist Workers\' Party Nazi Party under leadership of Adolf Hitler and support of former German army chief Erich von Ludendorff , entered into the political violence against the government and left-wing political forces as well. In 1923, in what is now known as the Beer Hall Putsch , the Nazis took control of parts of Munich , arresting the President of Bavaria, the chief of police, and others and forcing them to sign an agreement in which they endorsed the Nazi takeover and endorsed the Nazis objective to overthrow the German government. The putsch came to an end when the German army and police were called in to put down the putsch resulting in an armed confrontation where a number of Nazis and some police were killed. \n The Republic was under great pressure from both left-wing and right-wing extremists. The left-wing extremists accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers\' movement by preventing a communist revolution by unleashing the Freikorps upon the workers. Right-wing extremists were opposed to any democratic system, preferring an authoritarian state like the 1871 Empire. To further undermine the Republic\'s credibility, right-wing extremists (especially certain members of the former officer corps) used the Dolchsto\xc3\x9flegende for blaming an alleged conspiracy of Socialists and Jews for Germany\'s defeat in World War I. Both parties would make reckless use of the freedoms guaranteed by the new constitution in their fight against the Weimar Republic. It came to an end with the ascent of Hitler and the Nazi Party. \n [ edit ] Contemporary statements and historical research \n [ edit ] Political developments in the Weimar Republic \n The Revolution of 1918/19 is one of the most important events in the later history of Germany, yet it is poorly embedded in the historical memory of Germans. The failure of the Weimar Republic which this revolution brought into being and the following Nazi-era have obstructed the view of these events for a long time. To this very day, the interpretation of these events has been determined more by legends than by facts. \n Both the radical right and the radical left-\xe2\x80\x93under different circumstances\xe2\x80\x94nurtured the idea that a Communist uprising was aiming to establish a Soviet Republic following the Russian example. The democratic centre parties, especially the SPD, were also barely interested in fairly assessing the events which turned Germany into a Republic. At closer look these events turn out to be a revolution supported by the Social Democrats and stopped by their party leadership. These processes helped to weaken the Weimar Republic from its very beginning. \n After the Imperial Government and the Supreme Command shirked their responsibilities for the war and the defeat at an early stage, the majority parties of the Reichstag were left to cope with the resulting burdens. In his autobiography, Ludendorff\'s successor Groener states: "It suited me just fine, when the army and the Supreme Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected". [ 7 ] \n Thus, the " Myth of the Stab in the Back " was born according to which the revolutionaries stabbed the army, "undefeated on the field", in the back and only then turning the almost secure victory into a defeat. It was mainly Ludendorff who contributed to the spread of this falsification of history to conceal his own role in the defeat. In nationalistic and national minded circles the myth fell on fertile ground. They soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted the revolution and had done everything to channel and contain it, as "November Criminals" (Novemberverbrecher). In 1923, Hitler and Ludendorf deliberately chose symbolic 9 November as the date of their attempted " Beer Hall Putsch ". \n From its very beginning the republic was afflicted with the stigma of the military defeat. A large part of the bourgeoisie and the old elites from big industry, landowners, military, judiciary and administration never accepted the democratic republic, but intended to get rid of the new type of state at the first opportunity. On the left the actions of the SPD Leadership during the revolution drove many of its former adherents to the Communists. The contained revolution gave birth to a "democracy without democrats". [ 18 ] \n [ edit ] Contemporary statements \n Depending on their political standpoint of view, contemporaries had greatly differing opinions about the revolution. \n Ernst Troeltsch , a Protestant theologian and philosopher, rather calmly remarked how the majority of Berlin citizens perceived 10 November: \n \n "On Sunday morning after a frightful night the morning newspapers gave a clear picture: the Kaiser in Holland, the revolution victorious in most urban centres, the royals in the states abdicating. No man dead for Kaiser and Empire! The continuation of duties ensured and no run on the banks! (\xe2\x80\xa6) Trams and subways ran as usual which is a pledge that basic needs are cared for. On all faces it could be read: Wages will continue to be paid". [ 19 ] \n \n The liberal publicist Theodor Wolff wrote on the very day of 10 November in the newspaper Berliner Tageblatt , lending himself to far too optimistic illusions, which the SPD leadership also might have had: \n \n "Like a sudden storm, the biggest of all revolutions has toppled the imperial regime including everything that belonged to it. It can be called the greatest of all revolutions because never has a more firmly built (\xe2\x80\xa6) fortress been taken in this manner at the first attempt. Only one week ago, there was still a military and civil administration so deeply rooted that it seemed to have secured its dominion beyond the change of times. (\xe2\x80\xa6) Only yesterday morning, at least in Berlin, all this still existed. Yesterday afternoon it was all gone". [ 20 ] \n \n The extreme right had a completely opposite perception. On 10 November, conservative journalist Paul Baecker wrote an article in Deutsche Tageszeitung which already contained essential elements of the stab-in-the-back legend : \n \n "The work fought for by our fathers with their precious blood \xe2\x80\x93 dismissed by betrayal in the ranks of our own people! Germany, yesterday still undefeated, left to the mercy of our enemies by men carrying the German name, by felony out of our own ranks broken down in guilt and shame. \nThe German Socialists knew that peace was at hand anyway and that it was only about holding out against the enemy for a few days or weeks in order to wrest bearable conditions from them. In this situation they raised the white flag. \nThis is a sin that can never be forgiven and never will be forgiven. This is treason not only against the monarchy and the army but also against the German people themselves who will have to bear the consequences in centuries of decline and of misery". [ 21 ] \n \n In an article on the 10th anniversary of the revolution the publicist Kurt Tucholsky remarked that neither Wolff nor Baecker were right. Nevertheless Tucholsky did accuse Ebert and Noske of betrayal-\xe2\x80\x93not of the monarchy but of the revolution. Although he wanted to regard it as only a coup (d\'\xc3\xa9tat) he analysed the actual course of events more clearly than most of his contemporaries. In 1928 he wrote in "November Coup": \n \n "The German Revolution of 1918 took place in a hall." \n "The things taking place were not a revolution. There was no spiritual preparation, no leaders ready in the dark; no revolutionary goals. The mother of this revolution was the soldiers\' longing to be home for Christmas. And weariness, disgust and weariness." \n "The possibilities that nevertheless were lying in the streets were betrayed by Ebert and his like. Fritz* Ebert, whom you cannot heighten to a personality by calling him Friedrich opposed the establishment of a republic only until he found there was a post of chairman to be had; comrade Scheidemann \xc3\xa8 tutti quanti all were would-be senior civil servants." (* Fritz is the colloquial term for Friedrich like Willy \xe2\x80\x93 William) \n "The following possibilities were left out: shattering federal states, division of landed property, revolutionary socialization of industry, reform of administrative and judiciary personnel. A republican constitution in which every sentence rescinds the next one, a revolution talking about well acquired rights of the old regime can be only laughed at." \n "The German Revolution is still to take place." [ 22 ] \n \n Walter Rathenau was of a similar opinion. He called the revolution a "disappointment", a "present by chance", a "product of desperation", a "revolution by mistake". It did not deserve this name because it did "not abolish the actual mistakes" but "degenerated into a degrading clash of interests". \n \n "Not a chain was broken by the swelling of spirit and will, but a lock merely rusted through. The chain fell off and the freed stood amazed, helpless, embarrassed and needed to arm against their will. The ones sensing their advantage were the quickest." [ 23 ] \n \n The historian and publicist Sebastian Haffner in turn came out against Tucholsky and Rathenau. He lived through the revolution in Berlin as a child and wrote 50 years later in his book "Der Verrat" (The Betrayal) about one of the myths around the events of November 1918 which had taken root especially in the bourgeoisie: \n \n "It is often said that a true revolution in Germany in 1918 never took place. All that really happened was a breakdown. It was only the temporary weakness of the police and army in the moment of military defeat which let a mutiny of sailors appear as a revolution. \nAt first sight, one can see how wrong and blind this is comparing 1918 with 1945. In 1945 there really was a breakdown. \nCertainly a mutiny of sailors started the revolution in 1918 but it was only a start. What made it extraordinary is that a mere sailors\' mutiny triggered an earthquake which shook all of Germany; that the whole home army, the whole urban workforce and in Bavaria a part of the rural population rose up in revolt. This revolt was not just a mutiny anymore, it was a true revolution. (\xe2\x80\xa6) \nAs in any revolution, the old order was replaced by the beginnings of a new one. It was not only destructive but also creative. (\xe2\x80\xa6) \nAs a revolutionary achievement of masses the German November 1918 does not need to take second place to either the French July 1789 or the Russian March 1917." [ 24 ] \n \n [ edit ] Historical research \n During the Nazi regime, works on the Weimar Republic and the German Revolution published abroad and by emigrants in the 1930s and 1940s could not be read in Germany. Around 1935 this affected the first published History of the Weimar Republic by Arthur Rosenberg . In his view the political situation at the beginning of the revolution was open: The moderate socialist and democratic oriented work force indeed had a chance to become the actual social foundation of the republic and to drive back the conservative forces. On one hand this failed because of the wrong decisions of the SPD-Leadership, on the other because of the revolutionary tactics employed by the extreme left wing of the work force. \n After 1945 West German historical research on the Weimar Republic concentrated most of all on its decline. In 1951, Theodor Eschenburg ignored the revolutionary beginning of the republic to a great extent. In 1955, Karl Dietrich Bracher also dealt with the German Revolution from the perspective of the failed republic. Erich Eyck e. g. shows how little the revolution after 1945 was regarded as part of German history. In his two volume History of the Weimar Republic he barely dedicated 20 pages to these events. The same can be said for Karl Dietrich Erdmann\'s contribution to the 8th edition of the Gebhardt Handbook for German History ( Gebhardtsches Handbuch zur Deutschen Geschichte ), whose viewpoint dominated the interpretation of the events around the German Revolution after 1945. According to Erdmann 1918/19 was about the choice between "social revolution in line with forces demanding a proletarian dictatorship and parliamentary republic in line with the conservative elements like the German officer corps". [ 25 ] As the majority Social Democrats were forced to join up with the old elites to prevent an imminent council dictatorship, the blame for the failure of the Weimar Republic was to be put on the extreme left. According to this view, the events of 1918/19 were successful defensive actions of democracy against Bolshevism. \n This interpretation at the height of the Cold War is based on the assumption that the extreme left was comparably strong and a real threat to the democratic development. In this point, West German researchers ironically found themselves in line with Marxist historiography in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) which attributed considerable revolutionary potential most of all to the Spartacists. [ 26 ] While in the post war years the majority SPD (MSPD) was cleared of its Nazi odium as "November Criminals", GDR historians blamed the SPD for "betrayal of the working class" and the USPD leadership for their incompetence. Their interpretation was mainly based on the 1958 theories of the Central Committee of the SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) according to which the German Revolution was defined as a "bourgeois-democratic revolution", led in certain aspects by proletarian means and methods. The fact that a revolution by the working class in Germany never happened can be put down to the "subjective factor", especially the missing of a " Marxist-Leninist offensive party". Contrary to the official party line, Rudolf Lindau supported the theory that the German Revolution had a Socialist tendency. Consistently the founding of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was declared to be the decisive turning point in German history. But in spite of ideological bias historical research in the GDR expanded detailed knowledge of the German Revolution. [ 27 ] \n During the 1950s, West German historians focused their research on the final stages of the Weimar Republic. In the 1960s, they shifted to its revolutionary beginnings, realizing that the decisions and developments during the revolution were central to the failure of the first German Republic. Especially the Worker\'s and Soldier\'s Councils moved into focus and their previous appearance as a far leftwing movement had to be revised extensively. Authors like Ulrich Kluge, Eberhard Kolb , Reinhard R\xc3\xbcrup and others argued that in the first weeks of the revolution the social base for a democratic redesign of society was much stronger than previously thought and that the potential of the extreme left was actually weaker than the MSPD\'s leadership, for example, assumed. As "Bolshevism" posed no real threat, the scope of action for the Council of the People\'s Deputies (also supported by the more reform-oriented councils) to consistently democratise the administration, military and society had been relatively large. But the MSPD\'s leadership did not take that step because it trusted in the loyalty of the old elites and mistrusted the spontaneous mass movements in the first weeks of the revolution. The result of this was the resignation and radicalisation of the council movement. These theories have been supported by the publications of the minutes of the Council of the People\'s Deputies. Increasingly the history of the German Revolution appeared as the history of its gradual reversal. \n This new interpretation of the German Revolution gained acceptance in research rather quickly even though older perceptions remained alive. Research concerning the composition of the Worker\'s and Soldier\'s Councils which today can be easily verified by sources is undisputed to a large extent. But the interpretation of the revolutionary events based on this research has been already criticized and partially modified since the end of the 1970s. Criticism was aimed at the partially idealized description of the Worker\'s and Soldier\'s Councils which especially was the case in the wake of the German Student Movement of 1960s (1968). Peter von Oertzen went particularly far in this respect describing a social democracy based on councils as a positive alternative to the bourgeois republic. In comparison Wolfgang J. Mommsen did not regard the councils as a homogenous focussed movement for democracy but as a heterogeneous group with a multitude of different motivations and goals. Jesse and K\xc3\xb6hler even talked about the "construct of a democratic council movement". Certainly these authors also excluded a "relapse to the positions of the 1950s: "The councils were neither communist oriented to a large extent nor can the policies of the majority SPD in every aspect be labelled fortuitous and worth praising." [ 28 ] \n Heinrich August Winkler tried to find a compromise, according to which the Social Democrats depended to a limited extent on the cooperation with the old elites, but went considerably further than necessary: "With more political willpower they could have changed more and preserved less." [ 29 ] With all the differences concerning details, historical researchers agree that in the German Revolution, the chances to put the republic on a firm footing were considerably better than the dangers coming from the extreme left. Instead, the alliance of the SPD with the old elites constituted a considerable structural problem for the Weimar Republic.

The group places a priority on "solidarity work" to aid strikes and is strongly supportive of Cuba .

[ 1 ] \n After five years of propaganda work, the CLA remained a tiny organization, with a membership of about 200 and very little influence. [ 2 ] \n The rise of fascism in Nazi Germany and the failure of the communist and social democratic left to unite against the common danger created a situation where certain radical parties throughout the world reexamined their priorities and sought a mechanism for building united action. As early as December 1933, a Trotskyist splinter group called the Communist League of Struggle (CLS), headed by former Socialist Party youth section leader Albert Weisbord and his wife Vera Buch , approached Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party of America seeking a united front hunger march of the two organizations followed by a general strike. [ 3 ] This suggestion was dismissed as " poppycock " by SP Executive Secretary Clarence Senior , but the seed of the idea of joint action had been planted. [ 4 ] \n "Entryism" \n Early in 1934, some French Trotskyists of the Communist League conceived of the idea of entering the French Socialist Party (the Section Fran\xc3\xa7aise de l\'International Ouvri\xc3\xa8re or SFIO) in order to recruit members for the Trotskyists, or so some critics have charged. The group retained its identity as a factional organization inside the SFIO and built a base among the party\'s youth section, continuing their activity until popular front action between the SFIO and the mainline Communist Party of France made their position untenable. This tactic of "entering" the larger social democratic parties of each country, endorsed by Trotsky himself, became known as the " French Turn " and was replicated by various Trotskyist parties around the world. \n In 1934, the Communist League of America merged with the American Workers Party led by A.J. Muste , forming the Workers Party of the United States . \n Throughout 1935 the Workers Party of the United States was deeply divided over the " entryism " tactic called for by the "French Turn," and a bitter debate swept the organization. Ultimately, the majority faction of Jim Cannon , Max Shachtman , and James Burnham won the day and the Workers Party determined to enter the Socialist Party of America ; a minority faction headed by Hugo Oehler refused to accept this result and split from the organization. \n The Socialist Party was itself beset with factional disagreements. The SP\'s left wing "Militant" faction sought to expand the organization into an "all-inclusive party" \xe2\x80\x94 inviting in members of the Lovestone and Trotskyist movements as well as radical individuals as the first step towards making the SP a mass party . [ 5 ] Although there were no mass entries at this time, several radical oppositionists did make their way into the SP, including former Communist Party leader Benjamin Gitlow , youth leader and ex- Lovestone supporter Herbert Zam , and attorney and American Workers Party activist Albert Goldman . [ 4 ] Goldman at this time also joined with YPSL leader Ernest Erber to establish a newspaper in Chicago with a Trotskyist orientation, The Socialist Appeal, later to serve as the organ of the Trotskyists inside the Socialist Party. [ 6 ] \n In January 1936, just as the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party was expelling the Old Guard for their factional organization and alleged "violation of party discipline," James Cannon and his faction won their internal battle in the Workers Party to join the SP, when a national branch referendum voted unanimously for entry. [ 6 ] Negotiations commenced with the Socialist Party leadership, with the admissions ultimately made on the basis of individual applications for membership rather than admission of the Workers Party and its approximately 2,000 members as a group. [ 7 ] On June 6, 1936, the Workers Party\'s weekly newspaper, The New Militant, published its last issue and announced "Workers Party Calls All Revolutionary Workers to Join Socialist Party." [ 8 ] A new phase in the party\'s life had begun. \n Although party leader Jim Cannon later hinted that the entry of the Trotskyists into the Socialist Party had been a contrived tactic aimed at stealing "confused young Left Socialists" for his own organization, [ 9 ] it seems that at its inception, the entryist tactic was made in good faith. Historian Constance Myers notes that while "initial prognoses for the union of Trotskyists and Socialists were favorable," it was only later when "constant and protracted contact caused differences to surface." [ 10 ] The Trotskyists retained a common orientation with the radicalized SP in their opposition to the European war, their preference for industrial unionism and the CIO over the trade unionism of the American Federation of Labor , a commitment to trade union activism, the defense of the Soviet Union as the first workers\' state while at the same time maintaining an antipathy toward the Stalin government, and in their general aims in the 1936 election. [ 11 ] \n Cannon went to Tujunga, California , a suburb of Los Angeles, to establish another new newspaper, Labor Action, targeted to trade unionists and SP members and aimed at winning them over to Trotskyist views, while Shachtman and Burnham handled the bulk of the faction\'s activities in New York. \n Norman Thomas attracted nearly 188,000 votes in his 1936 Socialist Party run for President but performed poorly in historic strongholds of the party. Moreover, the party\'s membership had begun to decline. [ 12 ] The organization was deeply factionalized, with the Militant faction split into right ("Altmanite"), center ("Clarity") and left ("Appeal") factions, in addition to the radical pacifists around Norman Thomas. A special convention was planned for the last week of March 1937 to set the party\'s future policy, initially intended as an unprecedented "secret" gathering. [ 13 ] \n Split from the Socialist Party \n Prior to the March convention, the Trotskyist "Socialist Appeal" faction held an organizational gathering of their own, meeting in Chicago, with 93 delegates gathering from February 20\xe2\x80\x9322, 1937. [ 13 ] The meeting organized the faction on a permanent basis, electing a National Action Committee of five to "coordinate branch work" and "formulate Appeal policies." [ 14 ] Two delegates from the Clarity caucus were in attendance. James Burnham vigorously attacked the Labour and Socialist International, the international organization of left wing parties to which the Socialist Party belonged, and tension rose along these lines among the Trotskyists. United action between the Clarity and Appeal groups was not forthcoming and an emergency meeting of Vincent Dunne and Cannon was held in New York with leaders of the various factions including Thomas, Jack Altman , and Gus Tyler of Clarity. At this meeting Thomas pledged that the upcoming convention would make no effort to terminate the newspapers of the various factions. [ 15 ] \n There was no action to expel the Trotskyist Appeal faction, but pressure continued to build along these lines, egged on by the CPUSA\'s increasingly hysterical denunciations of Trotsky and his followers as wreckers and agents of international fascism. The convention did pass a ban on future branch resolutions on controversial matters, an effort to rein in the activities of the factions at the local level. It also did ban factional newspapers, establishing instead a national organ. \n Constance Myers indicates that three factors led to the expulsion of the Trotskyists from the Socialist Party in 1937: the divergence between the official Socialists and the Trotskyist faction on the issues, the determination of Altman\'s wing of the Militants to oust the Trotskyists, and Trotsky\'s own decision to move towards a break with the party. [ 16 ] Recognizing that the Clarity faction had chosen to stand with the Altmanites and the group around Thomas, Trotsky recommended that the Appeal group focus on disagreements over Spain to provoke a split. At the same time, Thomas, freshly returned from Spain, had come to the conclusion that the Trotskyists had joined the SP not to make it stronger, but to capture the organization for their own purposes. [ 17 ] \n On June 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 1937, a meeting of the Appeal faction\'s National Action Committee voted to ratched up the rhetoric against American Labor Party and Republican nominee for mayor of New York Fiorello LaGuardia , a favorite son of many in Socialist ranks, and to reestablish their newspaper, The Socialist Appeal. [ 18 ] This was met with expulsions from the party beginning August 9 with a rump meeting of the Central Committee of Local New York, which expelled 52 New York Trotskyists by a vote of 48 to 2, with 18 abstentions, and ordering 70 more to be brought up on charges. [ 18 ] Wholesale expulsions followed, with a major section of the YPSL leaving the party with the Trotskyists. \n The 1,000 or so Trotskyists who entered the SP in 1936 exited in the summer of 1937 with their ranks swelled by another 1,000. [ 19 ] On December 31, 1937, representatives of this faction gathered in Chicago to establish a new political organization \xe2\x80\x94 the Socialist Workers Party. \n Formation of the SWP \n The October 2, 1937, issue of the Socialist Appeal included a convention call from the so-called "Left Wing" to "All Locals and Branches of the Socialist Party," accusing the NEC of the party of having "betrayed the principles of socialism" by withdrawing the party\'s candidate for Mayor of New York in favor of LaGuardia and for having ordered "the bureaucratic expulsion of all the revolutionary members of the party who oppose and obstruct this sell-out policy." [ 20 ] A convention was called by four Socialist Party State Committees, the NEC of the YPSL, and the organized Left Wing organizations of Chicago and New York, slated to be held in Chicago over Thanksgiving weekend, November 25\xe2\x80\x9328, 1937. This meeting was quickly postponed until December 31, however, "in order to provide adequate time for discussion by the membership" of important questions. [ 21 ] \n In December 1937 an agenda was published by the Convention Organizing Committee, naming Cannon as the primary reporter on the Trade Union question, Shachtman on the Russian Resolution, Goldman on the Spanish Resolution, Canadian Maurice Spector on the International Resolution, Burnham on the Declaration of Principles of the new organization, and Abern on Party Organization and Constitution. [ 22 ] The gathering was to conclude with the election of a new National Committee. \n On the appointed day, December 31, 1937, over 100 regular and fraternal delegates gathered in Chicago, where they were greeted by a speech of welcome delivered by Chicago leader Albert Goldman, a labor attorney. As editor of the Trotskyist movement\'s ongoing theoretical magazine, The New International , Max Shachtman delivered the first official report to the gathering, dealing with the political situation in the United States. Shachtman boldly declared that \n \n "It is entirely inconceivable that American imperialism can succeed in resisting the inexorable tendencies that are pulling it into the vortex of the coming world war. \n \n"If the working class is unable to prevent the outbreak of war, and the United States enters directly into it, our party stands pledged to the traditional position of revolutionary Marxism. \n \n"It will utilize the crisis of capitalist rule engendered by the war to prosecute the class struggle with the utmost intransigence, to strengthen the independent labor and revolutionary movements, and to bring the war to a close by the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of proletarian rule in the form of the workers state." [ 23 ] \n \n The convention devoted a full day to discussion of the problems of the labor movement and the role of the new organization in the unions, with "National Secretary of the Convention Arrangements Committee" Jim Cannon delivering the primary report. While criticizing the "reactionary role which the AF of L leadership has played," Cannon declared that "our party...takes a clear-cut position in favor of the earliest and completest possible unification of the AF of L and the CIO, and also the hitherto unaffiliated Railroad Brotherhoods." [ 24 ] \n The 1940 split \n The 1940 split in the SWP followed an internal factional debate over the party\'s internal government, the class nature of the Russian state, and Marxist philosophy, among other questions. The SWP was to experience many other factional conflicts and splits in its history, but this was the largest, and it foreshadowed many features of those to come. \n The majority faction, led by Cannon, supported Trotsky\'s position that the USSR remained a " workers\' state " and should be supported in any war with capitalist states, despite their opposition to the government headed by Joseph Stalin. The minority faction, led by Shachtman, held that the USSR should not be supported in its war with Finland . One of its leaders, James Burnham held, in addition, that the USSR had degenerated so far that it deserved no defense whatsoever. Like this debate, most later factional disputes within the SWP also centered on different attitudes towards revolutions in other countries. \n The opposition faction alleged that Cannon\'s leadership of the SWP was "bureaucratic conservative" and demanded the right to its own publications to express its views outside the party. The majority faction said this was contrary to Lenin\'s concept of democratic centralism , and that disagreements and the SWP should be debated only internally. Similar disagreements over the SWP\'s internal government have surfaced in most later faction fights, with most later opposition factions raising similar demands and accusations. Despite this, most of these later factions claimed political descent from Cannon and the SWP majority, not from earlier opposition factions and splinter parties. \n The minority faction led by Shachtman eventually split away almost 40% of the party\'s membership as well as its youth organization, the Young People\'s Socialist League , forming the Workers Party . \n The World War II years \n A number of members were imprisoned under the Smith Act of 1941, including J. P. Cannon (see Smith Act Trials ). Those imprisoned included the main national leaders of the SWP and those members most prominent in the Midwest Teamsters. \n \n \n \n  \nGraffiti in the Basque Country: James P. Cannon, American Trotskyist \n \n \n The party put into practice the so-called Proletarian Military Policy of opposing the war politically while attempting to transform what they saw as an imperialist war into a civil war. The party lost a number of its members while sailing in the extremely perilous convoys to Murmansk. Problems caused as a result of the imprisonment of experienced leaders and the enlistment in the armed forces of many others meant that during the war years the editorship of The Militant passed through a number of hands. \n The SWP was active in supporting those labor strikes that occurred despite the wartime "no-strike pledge", and in supporting protests against racist discrimination during the war, such as A. Philip Randolph \'s March on Washington Movement . The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail some issues of The Militant and threatened to cancel its third-class mailing permit, citing objections to its articles opposing racist discrimination. \n Postwar years \n After the war the SWP and the Fourth International both expected that there would be a wave of revolutionary struggles such as accompanied the end of the previous war. Indeed, revolutions did occur in Yugoslavia , Albania , Korea , and China , to name only those that resulted in the overthrow of capitalism, but contrary to Trotskyist expectations they were headed by Moscow-oriented " Stalinist " parties. \n In the United States, the largest strike wave in U.S. history - involving over five million workers - occurred with the end of the war and the wartime pledge made by many union leaders not to strike for the duration. (This did not mean there were not many strikes during wartime - there were many wildcat strikes during this period, as well as strikes officially called by the United Mine Workers of America . There were also protests by GIs demanding rapid demobilization after the end of the war, sometimes called the going-home movement ). SWP participation in this upsurge led to a brief period of rapid growth for the SWP immediately after the war. \n The end of the war also saw the reorganization of the Fourth International, in which process the SWP played a major role. As part of this process, moves were made to heal the breach with Max Shachtman \'s supporters in the Workers Party (WP) and for the two groups to fuse. This eventually came to nothing. But some members of the SWP around Felix Morrow and Albert Goldman grew dissatisfied with what they saw as the SWP\'s ultra-leftist attitude towards revolutionary policies. Eventually they left the SWP in a state of demoralization and some joined the WP. \n Meanwhile a faction within the WP called the Johnson-Forest Tendency , named for CLR James (known as Johnson) and Raya Dunayevskaya (Forest), were impatient with the WP\'s caution and considered that the situation could rapidly become pre-revolutionary. This led them to decamp from the WP and rejoin the SWP in 1947. This tendency had moved further away from the " orthodox Trotskyism " of the SWP, which made for an uncomfortable presence. For example, they continued to hold the position that the USSR was a " state capitalist " society. By 1951, their presence in the SWP was ever more anomalous and most left to form the Correspondence Publishing Committee . Dunayevskaya and her supporters eventually formed the News and Letters Committees in 1955 after splitting with CLR James, who was deported from the USA to Britain from where he continued to advise the Correspondence Publishing Committee , which split again in 1962, with those loyal to CLR James taking the name Facing Reality . \n The Cold War period \n The brief postwar wave of labor unrest gave way to the conservatism of the 1950s, the housebreaking of previously radical labor unions, and McCarthyism . The growing civil rights movement, which continued uninterrupted out of WWII, could not fully offset these trends, and the SWP experienced a period of decline and isolation. \n The party also had a number of splits over these years. One such split saw the departure of the faction of Bert Cochran and Clarke, who formed the American Socialist Union , which lasted until 1959. That 1953 opposition supported some of the positions of Michel Pablo , the Secretary of the Fourth International , although Pablo disagreed with their wish to dissolve the Fourth International. \n The next, smaller split was that of Sam Marcy \'s Global Class War faction, which called within the SWP for support of Henry Wallace \'s Progressive Party Presidential run in 1948 and regarded Mao Zedong as a revolutionary leader. This faction ended up leaving the SWP in 1958 after supporting the suppression of the Hungarian Rising of 1956 , a position contrary to that held by the SWP and other Trotskyist tendencies. It went on to form the Workers World Party . \n Meanwhile throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s the remaining membership of the SWP clung to its firmly held beliefs and grew older. Consequently the party membership shrank over these years from a post war high in 1948 until the tide began to turn in the early 1960s. The 1959 Revolution in Cuba however signaled a change in political direction for the SWP as it embarked on pro-Castro "solidarity work" through the Fair Play for Cuba Committee . The result was a small accretion of youth to the party\'s ranks and in the same period long time SWP leader Murry Weiss won another group of youth from the Shachtmanites as they joined the Socialist Party of America . Many of the new recruits, however, were drawn from the student movement, unlike those who had led the party since the 1930s, and as a result the internal culture of the party began to change. \n 1960s \n \n \n Farrell Dobbs \n \n \n Despite such growing signs of an end to the isolation the group endured during the McCarthyite period, it experienced a new split in the early 1960s. A factional situation developed in the SWP that saw a number of small oppositional groups develop. One of the key issues was the Cuban Revolution and the SWP\'s response to it. Cannon and other SWP leaders such as Joseph Hansen saw Cuba as qualitatively different from the "Stalinist" states of Eastern Europe . Their analysis brought them closer to the International Secretariat of the Fourth International from which the SWP had split in 1953. The SWP successfully negotiated a reunification of the ISFI and the International Committee of the Fourth International leading to the creation in 1963 of the reunified Fourth International . Two sections of the ICFI, including Gerry Healy \'s Socialist Labour League rejected the merger and turned against the SWP leadership, working with opponents within the party. \n The most important faction opposing the SWP leadership\'s new line was the Revolutionary Tendency (RT) led by James Robertson and Tim Wohlforth that rejected the SWP\'s "capitulation" to Pabloism and opposed joining the USFI. They were critical of the Castro government, arguing that Cuba remained a " deformed workers state ". However, a split developed within this faction between groups headed by the two men. Nonetheless both the RT and the Reorganized Minority Tendency split to form the Spartacist (see Spartacist League ), and the American Committee for the Fourth International , respectively with the latter becoming aligned with Healy\'s SLL. \n In the aftermath the Seattle branch also left to found the Freedom Socialist Party , after protesting the alleged suppression of internal democracy, as did Murray and Myra Tanner Weiss . \n The SWP supported both the civil rights movement and the Black nationalist movement which grew during the 1960s. It particularly praised the militancy of Black nationalist leader Malcolm X , who in turn spoke at the SWP\'s public forums and gave an interview to Young Socialist magazine. After his assassination, the SWP had limited success in forming alliances with his followers and other Black nationalists. However, these movements were part of the radicalization of these years aiding the SWP\'s growth. \n Like all left wing groups, the SWP grew during the 1960s and experienced a particularly brisk growth in the first years of the 1970s. Much of this was due to its involvement in many of the campaigns and demonstrations against the war in Vietnam . The SWP advocated that the antiwar movement should call for the immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops, and should primarily focus on organizing large, legal demonstrations for this demand. It was recognized by friend and foe alike as a major factor influencing the direction of the antiwar movement along these lines. One of the leaders of the anti-war movement at this time, along with Dave Dellinger and many others was Fred Halstead , a World War II veteran and former leader of the garment workers union in New York City. Halstead was the 1968 Presidential candidate of the SWP who visited Vietnam in that capacity. \n The SWP was also increasingly outspoken in its defense of the Cuban government of Fidel Castro and its identification with that government. A new leadership led by Jack Barnes (who became national secretary in 1972) made identification with Cuba an ever greater part of the politics of the SWP throughout the 1970s. \n The party also published many of Leon Trotsky\'s works in these years through their publishing house, Pathfinder Press . Not only were the better-known writings reprinted, many for the first time since the 1930s, but other more obscure articles and letters were collected and printed for a wider audience than they had when first distributed. The expansion of the press also allow the SWP to host Intercontinental Press , the FI magazine which moved from Paris to New York in 1969, which later merged with Inprecor . \n 1970s and new leadership \n The growth of labor militancy in the early 1970s had an impact on the SWP and currents developed within it urging a reorientation of the party towards this militancy. One such current was the Proletarian Orientation Tendency , which included Larry Trainor , which eventually dissolved itself. \n Another tendency developed called the Internationalist Tendency (IT). The IT posed a greater challenge for the group\'s leadership, as the tendency agreed with the Fourth International\'s advocacy of guerrilla warfare as a "tactic on a continental scale" in Latin America. However, despite tensions between the SWP and the rest of the international, when the former expelled the IT the International refused to side with the tendency. The IT would disintegrate over the next few months, some of its supporters finding their way back into the SWP. \n The international tensions developed further when the Leninist Trotskyist Tendency was established in 1973 by the SWP and its co-thinkers in order to contribute to the debate for the Tenth World Congress . It argued for a reversal of the Latin American guerrilla war orientation adopted at the Ninth World Congress . \n This period was the peak of the SWP\'s growth and influence. The party continued its involvement in the movement against the war in Vietnam, which peaked in 1970-71. The SWP also supported Chicano nationalism, including the Raza Unida Party . It helped organize protests demanding legal abortion through the Women\'s National Abortion Action Coalition . With the mid-to-late 1970s decline of these movements and the end of the 1960s-1970s youth radicalization, SWP membership and influence went into decline. \n In 1978, the SWP leadership decided that the key task was for party members to make a turn to industry. This turn entailed party members getting jobs in blue collar industries in preparation for, the SWP leadership projected, increasing mass struggles. The 1977-78 coal miners\' strike and developments like Steelworkers Fight Back were among the events pointed to in arguing for this change in policy. Party members sought to get jobs in the same workplaces in order to work as organized "fractions", doing "communist political work" as well as union activity. \n As a result, many members were asked to move and change jobs, often out of established careers and into low-paying jobs in small towns. Many of the older members with experience in trade unions resisted this \'colonization program\', which upset their established routine in the unions, as did some of the younger members. \n 1980s and after \n Internal affairs \n Opposition to the "turn to industry" developed within the SWP. This opposition was not homogeneous and was itself beset by differences between different factions. \n A further factor in the growing divisions within the SWP was the move by Jack Barnes , Mary-Alice Waters and others in the leadership away from the Trotskyist label. In 1982, Barnes gave a speech which was later published as Their Trotsky and Ours: Communist continuity today in which Barnes rejected Trotsky\'s theory of Permanent Revolution arguing that it failed to sufficiently distinguish between the democratic and socialist tasks of a workers\' revolution. Barnes argued that anticapitalist revolutions typically began with a "workers\' and farmers\' government" which initially concentrated on bourgeois-democratic measures, and only later moved on to the abolition of capitalism. \n Barnes also argued that the "Trotskyist" label unnecessarily distinguished leftists in that tradition from leftists of other origins, such as the Cuban Communist Party , or the Sandinista National Liberation Front . He argued that the SWP had more in common with these organizations than with many groups calling themselves Trotskyist. The SWP has continued to publish numerous books by Trotsky and advocate a number of ideas commonly associated with Trotskyism, including Trotsky\'s analysis of "Stalinism". \n The opposition factions continued to support the theory of permanent revolution, and the Trotskyist label: they anticipated that the SWP leadership was reassessing its place in the Fourth International. While declaring their support to the Cuban and the leftist Nicaraguan governments, they were more critical of the Castroist and Sandinista leadership. Additionally, they continued to oppose the "turn to industry". \n One opposition group gathered around the Weinsteins on the West Coast, (with supporters elsewhere too), while a second group gathered around George Breitman and Frank Lovell . Together they formed an opposition bloc on the SWP\'s National Committee but in 1983 both groups were expelled. The opposition factions, having split from the SWP, formed new organizations. The grouping around the Weinsteins forming the San Francisco-based Socialist Action . The Breitman-Lovell group, after a time, formed the Fourth Internationalist Tendency . Both groups described themselves as "public factions" of the SWP and set the task of recapturing the SWP to their understanding of Trotskyism. Another group, mainly in Los Angeles, had been close to Breitman but did not agree to orient toward the SWP belonged briefly to Socialist Action but left to join the "regroupment" organization Solidarity . \n This was the most recent split or major faction fight in the SWP; the organization has experienced an unusually long period of internal peace since, although it has declined steadily in both its membership numbers and its political influence within the U.S. left. Numerous recent expulsions\xe2\x80\x94sometimes of long-standing SWP veterans\xe2\x80\x94have contributed to the membership decline. In 2003, the party sold its major headquarters building in New York City for $20 million and moved to another location in Manhattan. Party leaders Jack Barnes and Mary-Alice Waters subsequently sold their West Village condominium for $1.87 million. [ 25 ] \n Party activities \n The SWP\'s most high profile and controversial campaign in the late 1980s and early 1990s was its Mark Curtis Defense Committee, established after Curtis, an SWP activist and trade union organizer, was charged and convicted on burglary and rape charges in 1988. The party claimed that Curtis had been framed by police for his role in defending immigrant workers. Curtis was eventually paroled. \n The SWP now focuses most of its energy on internal activities, such as fund-raising, the weekly Militant Labor Forum, and the distribution of Pathfinder books and The Militant . Its members are present in a handful of trade unions and it focuses most of its political energy towards defending immigrant rights and promoting Cuban solidarity. \n The question of International affiliation \n Due to legal constraints, the SWP ended its formal affiliation with the Fourth International in the 1940s. It remained in close political solidarity with the Fourth International, however. The Socialist Workers Party broke formally with the Fourth International in 1990 though it had been increasingly inactive in the Trotskyist movement since National Secretary Jack Barnes\' 1982 speech, " Their Trotsky and Ours ", which some view as signaling a break with Trotskyism. The SWP action followed the 1985 World Congress, and the SWP closed Intercontinental Press in 1986. The SWP\'s international formation is sometimes referred to as the Pathfinder tendency because they each operate a Pathfinder Bookstore which sells the publications of the SWP\'s publishing arm, Pathfinder Press . In 1986, the party won a lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a result of years of spying and disruption. [ 26 ] \n The party and presidential politics \n The Socialist Workers Party has run candidates for President since 1948; it received its greatest number of votes in 1976, when its candidate, Peter Camejo , received 90,310 votes. \n In the U.S. presidential election of 2004 the Socialist Workers Party ran R\xc3\xb3ger Calero for President and Arrin Hawkins for Vice-President. It should be noted that both candidates were constitutionally unqualified for the positions (under Article II, section 1) because Calero is not an American citizen and Hawkins was 29 years old, with the minimum age being 35. James Harris and Margaret Trowe , the SWP\'s ticket from 2000, stood in on the ballot in some states where Calero and Hawkins could not be listed. The two tickets combined received over 10,000 votes. They were on the ballot in 11 states and the District of Columbia, more than any other socialist candidates. The vote total does not reflect the actual vote because of the unqualified status of the candidates. County clerks (in some states) and statewide Secretaries of State have discretion in reporting votes for ineligible candidates. The same situation obtained in 2008. \n \n 1948 \xe2\x80\x94 Farrell Dobbs / Grace Carlson : received 13,614 votes. \n 1952 \xe2\x80\x94Farrell Dobbs / Myra Tanner Weiss : received 10,312 votes. \n 1956 \xe2\x80\x94Farrell Dobbs / Myra Tanner Weiss : received 7,797 votes. \n 1960 \xe2\x80\x94Farrell Dobbs / Myra Tanner Weiss : received 60,166 votes. \n 1964 \xe2\x80\x94 Clifton DeBerry / Edward Shaw : received 32,327 votes. \n 1968 \xe2\x80\x94 Fred Halstead / Paul Boutelle : received 41,390 votes. \n 1972 \n \n Linda Jenness / Andrew Pulley : received 83,380 votes. In 1972 in Arizona, Pima and Yavapai counties had a ballot malfunction that counted many votes for both a major party candidate and Linda Jenness. A court ordered that the ballots be counted for both. As a consequence, Jenness received 16% and 8% of the vote in Pima and Yavapai, respectively. 30,579 of her 30,945 Arizona votes are from those two counties. Some sources don\'t count these votes for Jenness. \n Evelyn Reed / Clifton DeBerry : received 13,878 votes. Ballot access : Indiana , New York , and Wisconsin \n \n \n 1976 \xe2\x80\x94 Peter Camejo / Willie Mae Reid : received 90,986 votes.

He seen this revolution as only happening in the most advanced Industrial nations. Russia on the other hand was years behind the most advance countries of the west with a large peasant population with few industrial workers. Lenin believed the people would be forever kept down and needed a revolutionary party to achieve Communism, he envisioned Marx&#039;s vanguard party to look after Russian society till they could grow a large enough Industrial worker population.  \n \nHowever marx seen this party as &quot;The Communists, from an industrialized states who were on the one hand practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.&quot;(Karl Marx communist manifesto). However Lenin wanted to install Communism to Russia by his party the Bolsheviks and forsaking all others left wing parties, he knew he had to do this since Russia was over whelming a peasant country with few industrial working class which meant he wouldn&#039;t the the full support of the other parties. Even though a lot of the other parties were marxist they felt it wasn&#039;t Russia&#039;s time yet. \n \nLenin and Marx knew that Communism had to be international in order for it to work. \n \nLenin proclaimed the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; which he seen as a way of changing Russia into a Communist system. Lenin knew communism could never survive in a capitalist world. And used comintern in order to achieve this. However Lenin&#039;s death was a catastrophe for the Soviet Union which allowed the rise of Stalin. The world wide revolution was destroyed by the capitalist powers and the USSR changed to what Stalin called &quot;socialism in one country&quot; this fundamentally was the death of any chance communism would survive in Russia since they also disintegrated comintern. \n \nThe Soviet Union was closer to capitalism than it was to anything imagined by Marx this can be seen in the rise of an elite class of party bureaucrats called the Nomenklatura. Marx envisioned a classless society in an industrialized state which was would become truly democratic, where workers owned the means of production. The Soviet Union could never lose its vanguard party namely the Bolshevik/Communist party which was Lenin&#039;s creation and nothing to do with Marx. Since the communist party could not disintegrate it became the knew boss of the workers instead of what marx had hoped workers being the boss of themselves. \n \nHowever the fact that the Soviet Union was attacked and threatened from its birth to its end ensured that never stood a chance, since it had to industrialize and defend itself from capitalist/fascism aggression this all came at the expense of consumer goods for the ordinary Soviet citizen. \n \nHowever i will say this for the Soviet Union when Marxists entered Russian they found the plough, 80% of the people illiterate, life expectancy in the 40&#039;s, child mortality one of the worst in the world and they left a world super power who were able to reach space with child and adult mortality one of the highest in the world. An education system that was second to none and had nuclear weapons. I wonder what they could have created if they weren&#039;t attacked and threatened from birth. \n \nBasically Marx&#039;s vision was when the people cry out for a better system than the brutal unfair crises led system that is capitalism. The Soviet Unions vision was a revolution to destroy capitalism and work to install a communist utopia what they seen as a short cut to communism. \n\n    \n     Edited 2 years ago \n      \n        \n       Report Abuse \n       \n       \n\n        \n   \n    100% 1 Vote \n   \n   \n  \n      \n   \n    \n             1 person rated this as good \n           \n   \n     \n     \n \n    \n    \n \n \n\n \n    \n    0 stars - mark this as Interesting! \n   \n  Email \n   Comment ( 0 ) \n      \n   Save \n   \n         Add to My Yahoo! \n         Add to Del.icio.us \n      RSS \n   \n  \n  \t\n    \n   \n \n    \n    \n  \n     \n   \n \n   \n   \n \n   \n   \n\n \n \n\n  \n   There are currently no comments for this question. \n    * You must be logged into Answers to add comments.

It has a form of government characterized by single-party rule or dominant-party rule of a communist party (referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents) and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or Marxist\xe2\x80\x93Leninist ideology as the guiding principle of the state. Technically, "communist state" is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarcho-communists is in principle stateless . [ 1 ] From this perspective, the term Marxist-Leninist state is more appropriate. \n Historically, a "communist state" referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party -run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class ; today, a communist state can also, for instance, refer to contemporary China and Vietnam , where a Communist Party-run state exists alongside a mixed economy . According to Marxist\xe2\x80\x93Leninists, the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class , which in a socialist society is the working class, so a socialist state is, according to Leninists, a state of the working class . \n In practice, communist states do not actually refer to themselves as such. They do this not to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist, but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at present. Instead, they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers\' states. The primary goal of these states, which also explains their official name, is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism , ultimately leading to communism. \n Communist states may have several legal political parties , but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government, [ 2 ] often by statute or under the constitution. Consequently, the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined, such as in the development of parallel institutions. \n In the 20th century, most communist states adopted planned economies . However, there were exceptions: The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker self-management, while China , Vietnam and Laos introduced far-reaching market reforms after the 1980s. In the 21st century, China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to develop. \n The fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socio-economic ideologies from which they develop. As a result, many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these states. For example, dissenting communists such as Trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century, claiming either that they had nothing to do with "real" communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Types of communist states \n 2 State institutions \n \n 2.1 State social institutions \n 2.2 Political power \n \n \n 3 Objections to use of term \n 4 Criticism \n \n 4.1 From the liberal or conservative viewpoint \n 4.2 From the communist and socialist viewpoints \n \n \n 5 Modern period \n \n 5.1 List of current communist states \n 5.2 Disputed or mixed governments \n 5.3 Democratic states with current governing communist parties in power \n 5.4 Communist parties as part of a ruling coalition \n \n \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n \n \n \n \n Types of communist states \n While historically almost all claim lineage to Marxist thought, there are many varieties of communist states, with indigenous adaptions. \n These Communist states often do not claim to have achieved socialism or communism in their countries; rather, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam \'s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976, [ 3 ] and the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Cuba states that the role of the Communist Party is to "guide the common effort toward the goals and construction of socialism". [ 4 ] \n Alternative names that states adhering to an officially communist ideology may assign themselves is socialist state , socialist republic or "people\'s republic". This is because these nations have not yet transcended capitalism or state capitalism and progressed toward pure communism in the Marxist sense, which can only be achieved once capitalism exhausts itself. \n State institutions \n Marxist-Leninist states share similar institutions, which are organized on the premise that the communist party is a vanguard of the proletariat and represents the long-term interests of the people. The doctrine of democratic centralism , which was developed by Vladimir Lenin as a set of principles to be used in the internal affairs of the communist party, is extended to society at large. [ 5 ] \n According to democratic centralism, all leaders must be elected by the people and all proposals must be debated openly, but, once a decision has been reached, all people have a duty to obey that decision and all debate should end. When used within a political party, democratic centralism is meant to prevent factionalism and splits. When applied to an entire state, democratic centralism creates a one-party system . [ 5 ] \n The constitutions of most socialist states describe their political system as a form of democracy. [ 6 ] Thus, they recognize the sovereignty of the people as embodied in a series of representative parliamentary institutions. Such states do not have a separation of powers ; instead, they have one national legislative body (such as the Supreme Soviet in the Soviet Union) which is considered the highest organ of state power and which is legally superior to the executive and judicial branches of government. [ 7 ] \n Such national legislative politics in communist states often have a similar structure to the parliaments that exist in liberal republics, with two significant differences: first, the deputies elected to these national legislative bodies are not expected to represent the interests of any particular constituency, but the long-term interests of the people as a whole; second, against Marx\'s advice, the legislative bodies of communist states are not in permanent session. Rather, they convene once or several times per year in sessions which usually last only a few days. [ 8 ] \n When the national legislative body is not in session, its powers are transferred to a smaller council (often called a presidium ) which combines legislative and executive power, and, in some communist states (such as the Soviet Union before 1990), acts as a collective head of state . In some systems, the presidium is composed of important communist party members who vote the resolutions of the communist party into law. \n State social institutions \n Another feature of communist states is the existence of numerous state-sponsored social organizations ( trade unions , youth organizations, women\'s organizations, associations of teachers, writers, journalists and other professionals, consumer cooperatives, sports clubs, etc.) which are integrated into the political system. \n In some communist states, [ which? ] representatives of these organizations are guaranteed a certain number of seats on the national legislative bodies. In socialist states, the social organizations are expected to promote social unity and cohesion, to serve as a link between the government and society, and to provide a forum for recruitment of new communist party members. [ 9 ] \n Political power \n Historically, the political organization of many communist states has been dominated by a single-party monopoly. Some communist regimes, such as North Korea , East Germany or the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic have or had more than one political party, but all minor parties are or were required to follow the leadership of the communist party. In socialist states, the government may not tolerate criticism of policies that have already been implemented in the past or are being implemented in the present. [ 10 ] \n Nevertheless, communist parties have won elections and governed in the context of multi-party democracies , without seeking to establish a one-party state. Examples include San Marino , Republic of Nicaragua , [ 11 ]  Moldova , Nepal (presently), Cyprus , [ 12 ] and the Indian states of Kerala , West Bengal and Tripura . [ 13 ] However, for the purposes of this article, these entities do not fall under the definition of communist state. \n Objections to use of term \n The states ruled by communist political parties nonetheless self-identified as socialist states rather than as "communist states", because they did not consider themselves to have achieved the classless and stateless society known as communism . [ 14 ] In Marxism , communism is the final phase of history at which time the state would have "withered away" [ 15 ] and therefore "communist state" is a contradiction in terms under premises of this theory. Current states are either in the capitalist or socialist phase of history&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 making the term " socialist state " preferable to many communists and Marxist theorists. [ 16 ] \n Criticism \n Main article: Criticisms of communist party rule \n From the liberal or conservative viewpoint \n Totalitarian communist regimes have been criticized for their one-party dictatorships, totalitarian control of the economy and society and repression of civil liberties by the Council of Europe , [ 17 ] economic focus on heavy industry at the expense of consumer goods, sometimes resulting in shortages of vital products or even famine, [ 18 ] and militarism and propaganda to cover up the mistakes of the government . [ 19 ] \n From the communist and socialist viewpoints \n Within the socialist and communist movements themselves, there are a number of criticisms of using the term "communist states". Left communists, [ 20 ]  Anarchists and some Trotskyists [ 21 ] contend that the so-called "communist" or "socialist" states or "people\'s states" were actually state capitalist and thus cannot be called "socialist". \n Modern period \n \n \n \n  \nA map showing the current states (as of 2012) having a single-party political system and ruled by self-declared Marxist-Leninist governments. They are China , Cuba , Laos , and Vietnam . \n \n \n List of current communist states \n The following countries are one-party states in which the institutions of the ruling communist party and the state have become intertwined; hence they fall under the definition of Socialist states that officially support communism . They are generally adherents of Marxism-Leninism in particular and as such represent a particular ideology that many communists may not share. They are listed here together with the year of their founding and their respective ruling parties: [ 22 ] \n \n \n Country \n Since \n Party \n Leader \n \n \n &#160; People\'s Republic of China \n 1 October 1949 \n Communist Party of China \n Xi Jinping \n \n \n &#160; Republic of Cuba \n 1 July 1961 \n Communist Party of Cuba \n Ra\xc3\xbal Castro \n \n \n &#160; Lao People\'s Democratic Republic \n 2 December 1975 \n Lao People\'s Revolutionary Party \n Choummaly Sayasone \n \n \n &#160; Socialist Republic of Vietnam \n 2 September 1945 ( in the north ) \n 2 July 1976 (unified) \n \n Communist Party of Vietnam \n Triumvirate:\n \n Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n Ph\xc3\xba Tr\xe1\xbb\x8dng \n Nguy\xe1\xbb\x85n T\xe1\xba\xa5n D\xc5\xa9ng \n Tr\xc6\xb0\xc6\xa1ng T\xe1\xba\xa5n Sang \n \n \n \n \n Disputed or mixed governments \n \n &#160; Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (since 1948); Many people, especially in the west, would describe the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a Communist state. The DPRK has actually claimed that its so-called Socialist system was chosen by its people as a defence to human rights allegations , [ 23 ]  [ 24 ] thus justifying it when the DPRK is labelled as " Socialist ". The government\'s official ideology, on the other hand, is now the Juche policy of Kim Il-sung , as opposed to traditional Marxist\xe2\x80\x93Leninist communism . In 2009, the constitution of the DPRK was quietly amended so that not only did it disavow all Marxist-Leninist references present in the first draft, but it also dropped all reference to \'Communism\'. [ 25 ] \n \n Democratic states with current governing communist parties in power \n These are multi-party states that currently have communist parties leading the government. Such states are not considered to be communist states as the countries themselves allow for multiple parties, and do not provide a constitutional role for their communist parties. \n \n &#160; Nepal (since April 2008); Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ; In Nepal , the ruling Communist parties participate in a multi-party coalition government, an alliance of 22 parties that holds 350 seats in the 601-member constituent assembly. \n \n Communist parties as part of a ruling coalition \n There are also some parties that participate as junior partners in ruling coalitions, as listed below. \n \n &#160; Bangladesh , the Workers Party of Bangladesh participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Belarus , the Communist Party of Belarus participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Brazil , the Communist Party of Brazil participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Mali , the Malian Party of Labour participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Peru , the Peruvian Communist Party participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; South Africa , the South African Communist Party participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Sri Lanka , the Communist Party of Sri Lanka , participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Syria , the Syrian Communist Party (Bakdash) and the Syrian Communist Party (Unified) participate in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Ukraine , the Communist Party of Ukraine participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Uruguay , the Communist Party of Uruguay participates in the ruling coalition \n &#160; Venezuela , the Communist Party of Venezuela participates in the ruling coalition \n \n See also \n \n Capitalist state \n List of socialist countries , which includes a list of current and former communist states. \n List of communist parties \n Criticisms of communist party rule \n List of anti-capitalist and communist parties with national parliamentary representation \n \n References \n \n \n ^  "N.I.

But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the state, that is, of an organisation of the particular class, which was pro tempore the exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom, wage-labour). The state was the official representative of society as a whole; the gathering of it together into a visible embodiment. But it was this only in so far as it was the state of that class which itself represented, for the time being, society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, the feudal lords; in our own time, the bourgeoisie. When at last it becomes the real representative of the whole of society, it renders itself unnecessary. As soon as there is no longer any social class to be held in subjection; as soon as class rule, and the individual struggle for existence based upon our present anarchy in production, with the collisions and excesses arising from these, are removed, nothing more remains to be repressed, and a special repressive force, a state, is no longer necessary. The first act by virtue of which the state really constitutes itself the representative of the whole of society\xe2\x80\x94the taking possession of the means of production in the name of society\xe2\x80\x94this is, at the same time, its last independent act as a state. State interference in social relations becomes, in one domain after another, superfluous, and then dies out of itself; the government of persons is replaced by the administration of things, and by the conduct of processes of production. The state is not "abolished". It dies out .\xc2\xbb \n ^  Badiou, Alain .

As such the early period of Soviet ideology was typified by intellectual competition between varying trends, then between the predominant trend, Bolshevik Russian soviet democracy , and then the resultant ideological changes within the official ideology of the Soviet Union. \n [ edit ] The competing ideologies of the revolutionary period to 1923 \n Prior to 1923, ideology was both intellectually and politically contested within the Russian Revolution. At first, after the October Revolution, all party governments were formed amongst: Social Revolutionaries , Bolsheviks , Mensheviks , and limited anarchist groups. At the central level, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party \'s (RSDLP) Bolshevik party was predominant, but at the local level power was held by ideologically mixed non-workplace soviets or workplace council soviets. Through the course of the Revolution, falling outs occurred, significantly between the Left-SR party organisation and the Bolsheviks over the issue of war, leading to a rift with and suppression of Left-SR ideology. Additionally, the crisis between the Makhnovist Black Army and the Soviet Red Army , combined with the Kronstadt Uprising led to the suppression of anarcho-communist ideologies. [ citation needed ] In addition to this, the military and political success of the Bolshevik led Red Army caused numerous political activists to realign themselves behind Bolshevik ideology. \n [ edit ] Early Bolshevik ideology \n Most histories of Bolshevik ideology emphasise the central role of VI Lenin\'s internal party struggles in creating a cohesive ideological structure. To a lesser extent, Leon Trotsky \'s external critiques of Bolshevism form a central component of what is called in the contemporary period Leninism . \n [ edit ] Bolshevik ideological conflicts during the Civil War period \n Towards the later stages of the civil war a conflict emerged between the more workerist ideology of the left communists and later the Workers\' Opposition within the Bolshevik Party, and the Central Committee line. In both instances the minority ideology was suppressed, without the supporters of the ideological position being persecuted. [ citation needed ] \n [ edit ] Competition within the Central Committee during the 1920s \n The end of the Civil War\'s effects on Soviet Ideology, and of the position of War Communism , is generally held to being with the imposition of the New Economic Policy (NEP). While the NEP was debated throughout the 1920s, serious divisions emerged within the Bolshevik Party. Many of these divisions were expressed ideology in terms of debates over socialist development and internationalism, and resulted in the development of three broad lines of Soviet Ideology. \n [ edit ] Trotskyism and the International Left Opposition \n The smallest grouping was of the International Left Opposition and the supporters of Leon Trotsky . While this group was politically weak, it has had a great and continuing influence in ideological circles through the work of Leon Trotsky and his subsequent followers and supporters. \n [ edit ] The International Right Opposition \n The International Right Opposition was the second largest ideological grouping at the end of the 1920s. They emphasised the political development of socialism within continuing market relations. Ideologically this group proved to be ultimately sterile, though a significant amount of political work was published during the 1930s with some ideological implications. \n [ edit ] Marxism-Leninism and Stalinism \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Core tenets \n \n \n \n Communism \n Vanguard party \n Democratic centralism \n Central planning \n Proletarian internationalism \n Marxist\xe2\x80\x92Leninist atheism \n Single-party state \n Socialist patriotism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Topics \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n Stalinism \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Khrushchevism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Vladimir Lenin \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n Ernst Th\xc3\xa4lmann \n \n \n Earl Browder \n \n \n Gonchigiin Bumtsend \n \n \n Josip Broz Tito \n Fidel Castro \n \n \n Che Guevara \n Mao Zedong \n \n \n Deng Xiaoping \n Ho Chi Minh \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Mathieu K\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9kou \n \n \n Agostinho Neto \n Samora Machel \n \n \n Thomas Sankara \n Alfonso Cano \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Literature \n \n \n \n Wage Labour and Capital \n Materialism and Empirio-criticism \n Imperialism &#160;&#160; (Lenin) \n What Is to Be Done? \n The State and Revolution \n \n Dialectical and \nHistorical Materialism \n \n On Contradiction \n Guerrilla Warfare \n \n Fundamentals of \nMarxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History \n \n \n \n Great October Socialist Revolution \n \n \n Soviet Union \n Comintern \n \n \n Hungarian Soviet Republic \n \n \n Spanish Civil War \n World War II \n \n \n Warsaw Pact \n Greek Civil War \n \n \n Chinese Revolution \n \n \n Korean War \n Cuban Revolution \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n \n \n Non-Aligned Movement \n \n \n Sino-Soviet split \n Vietnam War \n \n \n Portuguese Colonial War \n \n \n Nicaraguan Revolution \n \n \n Nepalese Civil War \n \n \n Naxalite-Maoist insurgency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Bolshevism \n Leninism \n \n \n Maoism \n Marxism \n \n \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Titoism \n Trotskyism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communism portal \n Politics portal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n The largest group within Bolshevik ideology at the end of the 1920s were the followers and supporters of Joseph Stalin \'s advocacy of developing socialism within the Soviet Union without seeking overseas revolution. The chief document of Stalinist ideology under Stalin was the Short course history of the CPSU(b) . Followers of this ideological position have generally referred to themselves as "Marxist-Leninists" after 1956. \n [ edit ] Post-Stalin ideologies \n Subsequent to Stalin, some changes occurred in Soviet Ideology. Chief amongst these were Nikita Khrushchev \'s advocacy of developing quality in preference to quantity in Soviet development and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence ; and the declaration of the Brezhnev doctrine . During the 1940s 1950s and 1960s numerous experiments were made in political or organisational issues within Soviet communist framework in Eastern European actually existing socialist states, though there was little systematic creative ideological work conducted by State-supporting mainstream Marxists, the dissenting Marxists tending to produce new ideological material outside of the Soviet communist traditions. However, Imre Nagy \'s humanist socialism and Alexander Dubcek \'s socialism with a human face were developments of Soviet communist ideologists. Towards the end, Mikhail Gorbachev introduced new innovations in political life which were perceived by some to indicate ideological change. In 1985, Gorbachev announced that the Soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed. Initially, his reforms were called uskoreniye (acceleration) but later the terms such as glasnost (liberalisation, opening up) and perestroika (restructuring) became more popular. \n [ edit ] Criticism \n In the 1950s the Marxist intellectual Herbert Marcuse was commissioned by the government of the United States to complete a major work of Marxist analysis on the ideology of Soviet Communism, titled Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis . \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Index of Soviet Union-related articles \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n Soviet Union topics \n \n

The LSI was a forerunner of the present-day Socialist International . \n LSI had a history of rivalry with the Communist International (Comintern), with which it competed over the leadership of the international socialist and labour movement. [ 1 ] However, unlike the Comintern, the LSI had no control over its sections, as it was composed of autonomous national parties. [ 2 ] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Founding \n 2 Rise of Nazism \n 3 Colonial question \n 4 LSI members \n 5 References \n \n \n \n \n Founding \n The LSI was founded at a congress in Hamburg in May 1923 through the merger of the Berne International and the Vienna International . [ 3 ]  [ 4 ] The LSI functioned as a continuation of the Second International . [ 5 ] The Social Democratic Party of Germany was the dominant party within the LSI. [ 6 ] \n Rise of Nazism \n With the rise of Nazism in Europe, there was increased pressure on the LSI and Comintern to cooperate. On February 19, 1933, the LSI Bureau issued a call for joint action of the SPD and the Communist Party of Germany against Adolf Hitler \'s regime. The Comintern responded by stating that they were not convinced of the sincerity of the declaration. However, the Comintern did soon call of its national sections to form united fronts together with social democratic parties locally. The LSI, on its side, did not accept the notion of local social democrats forming united fronts with the communist parties. [ 7 ] However, as the Comintern adopted a more conciliatory tone, the resistance of the LSI against forming such united fronts on the national level softened. [ 8 ] \n Within the LSI, a north-south cleavage emerged, as the Mediterrean LSI parties built fronts with the communists whilst the British and Scandinavian parties rejected the notion of cooperation with the communists. With the German party in disarray, the British and Scandinavians had become more influential within the LSI. Thus the space for socialist-communist cooperation decreased. On September 25, 1934, the Comintern Executive had issued a call for \'peace negotiations\' between the two internationals, but the LSI rejected the offer. [ 9 ] \n After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War , the LSI and the International Federation of Trade Unions launched an \'Aid for Spain\' campaign. [ 10 ] The LSI/IFTU relief efforts were channelled through the Spanish Socialist Workers\' Party (PSOE) and Uni\xc3\xb3n General de Trabajadores (UGT). [ 11 ] \n Colonial question \n LSI did not have the same anti-imperialist approach as the communists and were generally supportive of colonialism. For example, the participation of the British Independent Labour Party in the communist-sponsored League against Imperialism caused a controversy within LSI, and the ILP was asked to break its ties with the League. However, the support of the LSI for colonialism was not complete. Regarding the Rif War the second LSI congress, held in Marseille August 22\xe2\x80\x9327, 1925, adopted a resolution calling for support to the independence of the Rif and urging the League of Nations to accept the Republic of the Rif as a member.

Until 15 March 1917. \n \n \n The Russian Revolution is the collective term for a series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the creation of the Russian SFSR . The Emperor was forced to abdicate and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar ; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). In the second revolution, during October, the Provisional Government was removed and replaced with a Bolshevik ( Communist ) government. \n The February Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now St. Petersburg). In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament or Duma assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government . The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution and Nicholas II , the last Emperor of Russia , abdicated. The Soviets (workers\' councils), which were led by more radical socialist factions, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914\xe2\x80\x9318), which left much of the Russian army in a state of mutiny. \n A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and the political left . During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions campaigned for stopping the conflict. The Bolsheviks turned workers militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army ) over which they exerted substantial control. [ 1 ] \n In the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolshevik party, led by Vladimir Lenin , and the workers\' Soviets, overthrew the Provisional Government in Petrograd. The Bolsheviks appointed themselves as leaders of various government ministries and seized control of the countryside, establishing the Cheka to quash dissent. To end Russia\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the First World War, the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. \n Civil war erupted between the "Red" (Bolshevik), and "White" (anti-Bolshevik) factions, which was to continue for several years, with the Bolsheviks ultimately victorious. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and St. Petersburg, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Background \n \n 1.1 Economic and social changes \n 1.2 Political issues \n \n \n 2 World War I \n 3 February Revolution \n 4 Between February and throughout October: "Dual Power" ( dvoevlastie ) \n 5 October Revolution \n 6 Civil war \n 7 Death of the imperial family \n 8 The Russian revolution and the world \n 9 Chronologies \n \n 9.1 Chronology of events leading to the Revolution of 1917 \n 9.2 Expanded chronology of events during the Revolution of 1917 \n \n \n 10 Cultural portrayal \n 11 See also \n 12 Footnotes \n 13 Notes \n 14 References \n 15 Further reading \n \n 15.1 Participants\' accounts \n 15.2 Primary documents \n 15.3 Other books \n \n \n 16 External links \n \n \n \n \n Background \n Main article: Russian history, 1892\xe2\x80\x931917 \n \n \n \n  \nSoldiers blocking Narva Gate on Bloody Sunday \n \n \n The Russian Revolution of 1905 was said to be a major factor to the February Revolutions of 1917. The events of Bloody Sunday triggered a line of protests. A council of workers called the St. Petersburg Soviet was created in all this chaos, and the beginning of a communist political protest had begun. [ 2 ] \n World War I prompted a Russian outcry directed at Tsar Nicholas II . It was another major factor contributing to the retaliation of the Russian Communists against their royal opponents. After the entry of Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a major trade route through Ottoman Empire, which followed with a minor economic crisis, in which Russia became incapable of providing munitions to their army in the years leading to 1917. However, the problems were merely administrative, and not industrial as Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst constantly fighting on two major battlefronts. [ 3 ] \n The war also developed a weariness in the city, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests , which had not been significantly altered during war-time. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, had been printing off millions of rouble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. The peasantry were consequently faced with the higher cost of purchases, but made no corresponding gain in the sale of their own produce, since this was largely taken by the middlemen on whom they depended. As a result they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916 revolutionary propaganda , aided by German funds, lead to widespread strikes. The outcome of all this, however, was a growing criticism of the government rather than any war-weariness. The original fever of patriotic excitement, which had caused the name of St. Petersburg to be changed to the less German sounding Petrograd, may have subsided a little in the subsequent years, but it had not turned to defeatism and during the initial risings in Petrograd in February 1917, the crowds in the streets clearly objected to the banners proclaiming "down with the war". Heavy losses during the war also strengthened thoughts that Tsar Nicholas II was unfit to rule. [ 3 ] \n The Liberals were now better placed to voice their complaints, since they were participating more fully through a variety of voluntary organizations. Local industrial committees proliferated. In July 1915, a Central War Industries Committee, established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist Guchkov, included ten workers\' representatives- in which the Petrograd Mensheviks agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad. All this activity gave renewed encouragement to political ambitions and in September 1915 a combination of Octobrists and Kadets in the Duma demanded the forming of a responsible government. The Tsar rejected these proposals. He had now taken over the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces and during his absence at his headquarters at Mogilev , he had left most of the day-to-day government in the hands of the Empress who was intensely unpopular, owing to her German origin and the influence that Rasputin , an unsavoury monk, was thought to exercise over her. [ 4 ] \n All these factors had given rise to a sharp loss of confidence in the regime by 1916. Early in that year, Guchkov had been taking soundings among senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar. In November, Pavel Milyukov in the Duma openly accused the government of contemplating peace negotiations with Germany. In December, a small group of nobles assassinated Rasputin and in January 1917 the Tsar\'s uncle, Grand Duke Nicholas , was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II. None of these incidents were in themselves the immediate cause of the February Revolution, but they do help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few days after it had broken out. [ 4 ] \n \n \n \n  \nRussian soldiers marching in Petrograd in February 1917 \n \n \n Meanwhile, the Social Democrat leaders in exile, now mostly in Switzerland , had been the glum spectators of the collapse of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Helphand supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities . [ 4 ] \n It was these views of Martov that predominated in a manifesto drawn up by Leon Trotsky (a major Bolshevik revolutionary) at a conference in Zimmerwald , attended by thirty-five Socialist leaders in September 1915. Inevitably Vladimir Lenin , supported by Zinoviev and Radek , strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace. Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that "from the standpoint of the working class and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be the defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy"; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe. Thus, Lenin remained the enfant terrible of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party , although at this point in the war his following in Russia was as few as 10,000 and he must have seemed no more than the leader of an extremist wing of a bankrupt organization. Lenin, however, then executed the protests of Petrograd which set off the 1917 Russian Revolution. [ 5 ] \n Economic and social changes \n An elementary theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong to those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical movement of growing numbers of peasant villagers who migrated to and from industrial and urban environments, but also by the introduction of city culture into the village through material goods, the press, and word of mouth. [ nb 1 ] \n Workers also had good reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable sanitary conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11\xe2\x80\x9312 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from very poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen\xe2\x80\x99s fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep war-time increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen while in the village. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order. [ nb 2 ] \n The social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly came from centuries of oppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime, and Nicholas\'s failures in World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked. The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte \'s land reforms of the early 20th century. Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked. Russia consisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5% of the population owning 25% of the land. [ citation needed ] \n The rapid industrialization of Russia also resulted in urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new \'proletariat\' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia\'s workers were highly concentrated. By 1914 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of +1,000 workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100-1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1-100 worker businesses (in the USA, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively). [ 6 ] \n \n \n Years \n Average annual strikes [ 7 ] \n \n \n 1862-9 \n 6 \n \n \n 1870-84 \n 20 \n \n \n 1885-94 \n 33 \n \n \n 1895\xe2\x80\x931905 \n 176 \n \n \n World War I only added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling in all parts of Russia. The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves to look for food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar. \n \n \n \n  \nThe Petrograd Soviet Assembly meeting in 1917 \n \n \n Political issues \n Many sections of the crown had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people. [ nb 3 ] \n This idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state of his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree limited civil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even these liberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown. [ nb 3 ] \n Despite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of Enlightenment , Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I. \n Dissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar\'s troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto , which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma ). The Tsar undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws , and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy. \n One of the Tsar\xe2\x80\x99s principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war . Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions. Instead of restoring Russia\'s political and military standing, World War I led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse. \n \n \n \n  \nTsar Nicholas II among his troops during World War I \n \n \n World War I \n The outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government. [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ] \n Russia\'s first major battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg , over 30,000 Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000 captured, while Germany suffered just 20,000 casualties. However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia\'s main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented. In the eyes of Lynch, a revisionist historian who focuses on the role of the people, Rasputin was a "fatal disease" to the Tsarist regime. \n In 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to the Eastern front. The superior German army&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 better led, better trained and better supplied&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 was terrifyingly effective against the ill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland, during the Gorlice\xe2\x80\x93Tarn\xc3\xb3w Offensive campaign. By the end of October 1916, Russia had lost between 1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional 2,000,000 prisoners of war and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of nearly 5,000,000 men. \n These staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts that began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy started to circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes, munitions, and even weapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a series of military defeats. \n \n \n \n  \nRussian troops awaiting German attack in trenches \n \n \n Casualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained recruits had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917. \n The huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. With good reason, the soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as human beings, or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of the rich and powerful. \n By the spring of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the situation had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families, remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) "was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved." [ 11 ] \n The war devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg , where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually buy food. \n Not surprisingly, strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end. \n Government officials responsible for public order worried about how long people\'s patience would last. A report by the St. Petersburg branch of the security police, the Okhrana , in October 1916, warned bluntly of "the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower classes of the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence." [ 12 ] \n Nicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. As discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916. It stated that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional form of government was put in place. In typical fashion, however, Nicholas ignored them, and Russia\'s Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed. Ultimately, Nicholas\'s inept handling of his country and the war destroyed the Tsar and ended up costing him both his reign and his life. \n February Revolution \n Main article: February Revolution \n \n \n \n  \nRevolutionaries protesting on February 1917 \n \n \n At the beginning of February, Petrograd workers began several strikes and demonstrations . [ citation needed ] On March 7 [ O.S. February 22] , workers at Putilov , Petrograd\'s largest industrial plant, announced a strike. [ 13 ] \n The next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women\'s Day , which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread , and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike. [ 14 ] By March 10 [ O.S. February 25] , virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-collar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public meetings. [ citation needed ] \n To quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000 troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included so many women. It was for this reason that when, on March 11 [ O.S. February 26] , the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny. [ 15 ] Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed \xe2\x80\x93 not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day. [ 16 ] \n The Tsar took a train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped on March 14 [ O.S. March 1] , [ 15 ] by a group of disloyal troops. When the Tsar finally reached his destination, the Army Chiefs and his remaining ministers (those who had not fled under pretense of a power-cut) suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. [ citation needed ] He did so on March 15 [ O.S. March 2] , on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice, on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich . [ 15 ] Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich , to succeed him. But the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown on March 16 [ O.S. March 3] , [ 15 ] stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action. [ 17 ] Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as "Nicholas Romanov", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo . [ 18 ] He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government. \n The immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd. [ 19 ] On 16 March [ O.S. 3 March] , a provisional government was announced. The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov , a member of the Constitutional Democratic party (KD). [ 20 ] The socialists had formed their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers\' council) four days earlier. The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over Russia. \n Between February and throughout October: "Dual Power" ( dvoevlastie ) \n The effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and soldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the early months of the revolution&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the Petrograd Soviet [Council] of Workers\' Deputies. The model for the soviet were workers\' councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 revolution. In February 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties. On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council. The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace , the same building where the new government was taking shape. \n The leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant "bourgeoisie" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on). [ 21 ] They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new government, to act, in other words, as a popular democratic lobby. \n The relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to "take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers\' Deputies", though they were also determined to prevent "interference in the actions of the government", which would create "an unacceptable situation of dual power." [ 22 ] In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this "dual power" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the trenches, and in the villages. \n \n \n \n  \nThe 2nd Moscow Women Death Battalion protecting the Winter Palace as the last guards of the stronghold \n \n \n A series of political crises&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 see the chronology below&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership, The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK)) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviet. Although the Soviet leadership initially refused to participate in the "bourgeois" Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky , a young and popular lawyer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP), agreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in the government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government. As minister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech, released thousands of political prisoners, did his very best to continue the war effort and even organised another offensive (which, however, was no more successful than its predecessors). Nevertheless, Kerensky still faced several great challenges, highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers and peasants, who claimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution: \n \n Other political groups were trying to undermine him. \n Heavy military losses were being suffered on the front. \n The soldiers were dissatisfied and demoralised and had started to defect. (On arrival back in Russia, these soldiers were either imprisoned or sent straight back into the front.) \n There was enormous discontent with Russia\'s involvement in the war, and many were calling for an end to it. \n There were great shortages of food and supplies, which was difficult to remedy because of the wartime economic conditions. \n \n The political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin . Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution. Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult. Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 if the Bolsheviks came to power&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 lead to Russia\'s withdrawal from the war. Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany. After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917. \n \n \n \n  \nStreet demonstration on Nevsky Prospekt in Petrograd just after troops of the Provisional Government opened fire in the July Days \n \n \n With Lenin\'s arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily. Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties. Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for "all power to the Soviets," the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin\'s exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself, which was viewed as subservient to the conservative government. By most historians\' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917. \n \n \n \n  \nSoviets attacking the Czar\'s police in the early days of the March Revolution \n \n \n On 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to follow the new orders. The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 who had tried and executed many officers, including one admiral&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for "all power to the Soviets." The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin [ 23 ] and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky , among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested. The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups: soldiers and workers. \n The Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary. The Bolsheviks had undergone a spectacular growth in membership. Whereas, in February 1917, the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction. [ 24 ] Previously, the Bolsheviks had been in the minority in the two leading cities of Russia\xe2\x80\x94St. Petersburg and Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September the Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities. [ 25 ] Furthermore, the Bolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the Party organizations of the thirteen (13) provinces around Moscow. These thirteen provinces held 37% of Russia\'s population and 20% of the membership of the Bolshevik faction. [ 25 ] \n In August, poor or misleading communication led General Lavr Kornilov , the recently appointed Supreme Commander of Russian military forces, to believe that the Petrograd government had already been captured by radicals, or was in serious danger thereof. In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city. To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance. He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to "defend the revolution". The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position. The Bolsheviks\' role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position. \n In early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as a force in support of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes. \n In Finland, Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution  [ 26 ] and continued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By October, he returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), aware that the increasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and a second opportunity for revolution. Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks. Lenin was of the opinion that taking power should occur in both St. Petersburg and Moscow simultaneously, parenthetically stating that it made no difference which city rose up first, but expressing his opinion that Moscow may well rise up first. [ 27 ] The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet. The resolution was passed 10\xe2\x80\x932 ( Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) and the October Revolution began. \n October Revolution \n Main article: October Revolution \n \n \n \n  \n Vladimir Lenin , leader of the Bolsheviks , speaking at a meeting in Sverdlov Square in Moscow , with Leon Trotsky and Lev Kamenev adjacent to the right of the podium \n \n \n The October Revolution was led by Vladimir Lenin and was based upon Lenin\'s writing on the ideas of Karl Marx , a political ideology often known as Marxism-Leninism . It marked the beginning of the spread of communism in the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the revolution of February and came about as the result of deliberate planning and coordinated activity to that end. \n Though Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky\'s organization and direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin instigated within his party. [ citation needed ] Critics on the Right have long argued that the financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent, Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided, since there is little evidence supporting that claim. \n On 7 November 1917, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the Julian Calendar at the time, so period references show a 25 October date). The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia\'s short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets , local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army , immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks\' Red Army , in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War. \n Soviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party , anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets. This obviously caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for "a third Russian revolution," a movement that received a considerable amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-bolshevik mentality were expressed in the Tambov rebellion , 1919\xe2\x80\x931921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked effective coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the Civil War . \n Civil war \n \n \n \n  \nAmerican, British, and Japanese Troops parade through Vladivostok in armed support to the White Army \n \n \n Main articles: Russian Civil War and Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War \n The Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly after the revolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people regardless of their political orientation. The war was fought mainly between the Red Army ("Reds"), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik minority, and the "Whites" &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 army officers and cossacks, the "bourgeoisie", and political groups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government to the soviets (under clear Bolshevik dominance). [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] The Whites had backing from nations such as Great Britain, France, USA and Japan, while the Reds sported internal, domestic support which proved to be much more effective. Though the Allied nations, using external interference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely knit anti-Bolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated. [ 28 ] \n The Bolsheviks firstly assumed power in Petrograd (modern-day Saint Petersburg), expanding their rule outwards, eventually reaching the Easterly Siberian Russian coast 4 years after the war in Vladivostok , an occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military campaigns in the nation. Less than one year later, the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District , directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923. \n Several revolts were initiated purely by the general public against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion, a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt, an armed uprising against the rightfully antagonized Bolshevik economic policies subjected to farmers, including forced seizures of grain crops by the Communists. [ 30 ] This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining on the Russian right to freedom [ 31 ] The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts, however suffering 10 thousand mortalities before entering the city of Kronstadt, [ 32 ] ending the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to flee in political exile. [ 33 ] \n During the Civil War, Nestor Makhno led a Ukrainian anarchist movement, the Black Army allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the powers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge into the Red Army . In addition, the so-called " Green Army " (peasants defending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war, mainly in the Ukraine. \n Death of the imperial family \n Main article: Shooting of the Romanov family \n In early March, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo , 15 miles (24&#160;km) south of Petrograd. In August 1917 the Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals , allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution during the Red Terror . After the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to Yekaterinburg , a militant Bolshevik stronghold. \n During the early morning of July 16, at approximately 01:30, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and killed. According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly from Vladimir Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. It has been argued that the execution may have been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or that it was an option approved in Moscow should White troops approach Yekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin\'s bodyguard personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the evidence. [ 34 ]  [ 35 ] \n The Russian revolution and the world \n Main article: Revolutions of 1917\xe2\x80\x9323 \n Leon Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without the success of the world revolution . Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918\xe2\x80\x931919 , in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic and others like it, no other Marxist movement succeeded in keeping power in its hands. \n This issue is subject to conflicting views on the communist history by various Marxist groups and parties. Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea, stating that socialism was possible in one country . \n The confusion regarding Stalin\'s position on the issue stems from the fact that he, after Lenin\'s death in 1924, successfully used Lenin\'s argument&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the argument that socialism\'s success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution. \n Chronologies \n Chronology of events leading to the Revolution of 1917 \n Dates are correct for the Julian calendar , which was used in Russia until 1918.

There is a 1947 law in New York state that allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson, who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. "We respectfully disagree with anyone who wants to change the Wilson-Pakula law," says MacKay, chairman of the state Independence Party. "Without Wilson-Pakula, a wealthy candidate could override the philosophy of a party which he has nothing in common with."\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Mike Groll\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FILE - In this Sept. 29, 2010 file photo, New York Republican... \n\n\t\n\n    \n   \n        \n   \n   \n\n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\tFILE - In this March 20, 2013 file photo, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks during a news conference in the Red Room at the Capitol in Albany, N.Y. There is a 1947 law in New York state that allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson, who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. In April, Bharara accused Democratic Sen. Malcolm Smith of Queens of trying to bribe his way onto the Republican line to run for New York City mayor. Smith denies the charge and state Republican Chairman Ed Cox said his party would never have accepted Smith. Now, Cuomo wants to dismantle the Wilson-Pakula law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPhoto: Mike Groll\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FILE - In this March 20, 2013 file photo, New York Gov.

(AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Who are Wilson and Pakula and why is their arcane 1947 law a major issue in Albany today? Wilson-Pakula is the original party crasher law, created during America\'s Red Scare to keep socialists and communists from infiltrating political parties and taking them over from within. In a measure that may only make sense in New York\'s power politics, it places extraordinary power in the hands of political party bosses. It allows a party leader to grant a ballot line to a candidate not enrolled in the leader\'s party. The extra line, prohibited in most states, is a strategic and critical tool for many candidates in New York to attract more votes. Today, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara has resurrected the debate over the law that was sponsored by Assemblyman Malcolm Wilson , who later became governor, and Sen. Irwin Pakula of Queens. In April, Bharara accused Democratic Sen. Malcolm Smith of Queens of trying to bribe his way onto the Republican line to run for New York City mayor. Smith denies the charge and state Republican Chairman Ed Cox said his party would never have accepted Smith. Now, Gov. Andrew Cuomo wants to dismantle Wilson-Pakula. He wants to take away the power of party chairmen to grant waivers allowing an insider onto the party line. Instead, Cuomo wants to require a petition process that would require broader political support by party members, which some minor parties already offer. "You have heard the expression \'pay to play\'?" Cuomo said, referring to the practice in which lobbyists make campaign donations to get or stop legislation. "This is \'pay to run.\' "The allegation is that the minor parties basically, on occasion, have used campaign contributions to determine who gets the line," Cuomo said. "It\'s almost that the line goes to the highest bidder." The Independent Democratic Conference, which shares majority control of the Senate with Republicans, also supports repeal. Wilson-Pakula, however, is being defended by the unlikeliest band of liberals, conservatives, moderates and disenfranchised voters equally disgusted by the Democratic and Republican parties. They note eliminating the power of a party\'s top leader to block a candidate gives more power to the Democratic and Republican parties through infiltrating operatives to control or silence minority parties and their voices. Supporters pose a scenario in which a wealthy candidate \xe2\x80\x94 for example, a conservative \xe2\x80\x94 could organize enough supporters to infiltrate a minor party of liberals and collect votes from liberals who assumed the candidate shared their values. The next step, supporters portend, would include Republicans and Democrats infiltrating the opposition party, resulting in two parties indistinguishable from each other or, worse, a de facto single party. "We respectfully disagree with anyone who wants to change the Wilson-Pakula law," said Frank MacKay , chairman of the state Independence Party . "Without Wilson-Pakula, a wealthy candidate could override the philosophy of a party which he has nothing in common with." On this, many liberals and conservatives agree. "Hey, I don\'t like the Working Families Party ," said state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long . "But they stand for a set of principles and enunciate a set of principles. ... We feel this is important for this nation. It would really end a philosophical bent to political parties in New York." The liberal Working Families Party agrees. "The governor\'s proposal will cause a tremendous amount of confusion and chaos among voters and is a direct attack on the rights of minor parties to be effective participants in New York politics," said Dan Cantor , executive director of the party. "We know a lot of people vote on our line and we know a lot don\'t. But they\'ve come to rely on our line meaning something," Cantor said. "The governor is trying to make ideas even less important in politics. And that\'s a bad thing." The Green Party , another liberal force, calls efforts to repeal Wilson-Pakula an assault on the First Amendment and a move that would make well-funded candidates even more powerful. Cuomo has more than $20 million in his campaign fund and the Democratic line in a state dominated nearly 2-to-1 by Democratic voters. He has no need to run on a minor party line, but for his Republican opponent, additional lines will be essential. "Cuomo and the Independent Democratic Conference aren\'t interested in preventing corruption," said Gloria Mattera , co-chairwoman of the Green Party. "They just want to further weaken political parties and make it easier for the candidates with the most money to buy elections." \n \t \t\n \n \n \n \n\n\n   \n \n\n\n   \n   \n    Printable Version \n   \n   \n    Email This \n     \t \n\t   \n    \n   \n   \n    Tweet \n   \n   \n    \n   \n\n  \n   \n  \t\n  \t\n  \t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n   \n  \n \n\n\t  \t\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \t \n  1947 law new focus of anti-corruption debate in NY \n \t  \t\n \n\t Associated Press \n\t \n Copyright 2013 Associated Press.

Some religious societies that have stressed egalitarianism and common ownership of goods have been described as communist, including early Christianity and the Shakers of 19th century America. Marxism subsequently gained support across much of Europe, and under the control of the Bolshevik Party , a communist government seized power during the Russian revolution , leading to the creation of the Soviet Union , the world\xe2\x80\x99s first Marxist state, in the early 20th century. \n During ensuing decades, governments using the "Communist" name obtained power in many parts of the world, including most of eastern Europe , eastern Asia and parts of Africa . During the late 1980s and early 1990s most of these "Communist" regimes collapsed and adopted capitalistic economic policies , even though some remained nominally communist, like the People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of China . Today, nominal communist governments control countries like Cuba and Vietnam . \n Various historians have studied the history of communism , including Robert Service and Archie Brown , many of whom have taken a negative view of the ideology, which they viewed as having a tendency towards authoritarianism , totalitarianism and for allowing human rights abuses . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Early development (1840\xe2\x80\x931916) \n \n 1.1 Pre-Marxist Communism \n 1.2 Karl Marx \n 1.3 Early development of Marxism \n \n \n 2 International communism: periodization \n 3 The Early Communist States (1917\xe2\x80\x931947) \n \n 3.1 The Russian Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union \n 3.2 Comintern, Mongolia and the communist uprisings in Europe \n 3.3 Front organisations \n 3.4 Stalinism in the Soviet Union \n \n 3.4.1 The Great Terror \n \n \n 3.5 Pre-war dissident communisms \n \n \n 4 Spreading Communism (1945\xe2\x80\x931957) \n \n 4.1 Soviet Union \n 4.2 Eastern Europe \n \n 4.2.1 Hungarian Revolution of 1956 \n 4.2.2 Prague Spring 1968 \n \n \n 4.3 West Germany \n 4.4 China\'s Great Leap Forward \n 4.5 Early post-war dissident Communisms \n \n \n 5 The Cold War and Revisionism (1957\xe2\x80\x931979) \n \n 5.1 Maoism and the Cultural Revolution in China \n 5.2 The Cuban Revolution \n 5.3 Eurocommunism \n \n \n 6 The Collapse of the Communist Powers (1980\xe2\x80\x931992) \n 7 Contemporary Communism (1993-Present) \n 8 References \n 9 Further reading \n \n 9.1 Primary sources \n \n \n 10 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Early development (1840\xe2\x80\x931916) \n [ edit ] Pre-Marxist Communism \n Further information: Primitive communism ,&#160; Pre-Marxist Communism ,&#160;and&#160; Religious communism \n Many historical groups have been considered as following forms of communism. Karl Marx and other early communist theorists believed that hunter-gatherer societies, as were found in the Palaeolithic , were essentially egalitarian and he therefore termed their ideology to be " primitive communism ". Certainly, communist ideas do predate Marxism, with various philosophers in Ancient Greece, such as Pythagoras and Plato (in his The Republic ) propagating the idea of common ownership. Some have also claimed that early Christianity supported a form of communism through the teachings in the New Testament which emphasised sharing amongst everyone equally. Other ancient Jewish sects, like the Essenes , also supported egalitarianism and communal living. [ 1 ] \n In Europe during the Early Modern period , various groups supporting communist ideas appeared. Tommaso Campanella in his The City of the Sun propagated the concept of a society where the products of society should be shared equally (1601). [ 2 ] Within a few centuries, during the English Civil War , various groups on the side of the Roundheads propagated the redistribution of wealth on an egalitarian basis, namely the Levellers and the Diggers . [ 3 ] In the eighteenth century the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau in his hugely influential The Social Contract (1762), outlined the basis for a political order based on popular sovereignty rather than the rule of monarchs. [ 4 ] His views proved influential during the French Revolution of 1789 , in which various anti-monarchists, particularly the Jacobins , supported the idea of redistributing wealth equally among the people, including Jean-Paul Marat and Gracchus Babeuf . The latter was involved in the Conspiracy of the Equals of 1796 intending to establish a revolutionary regime based on communal ownership, egalitarianism and the redistribution of property. [ 5 ] The plot was however detected and he and several others involved were arrested and executed. Despite this setback the example of the French Revolutionary regime and Babeuf\'s doomed insurrection was an inspiration for radical French thinkers such as Compte Henri de Saint Simon , Louis Blanc , Charles Fourier and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon who declared that Property is theft! \xe2\x80\x9d. [ 6 ]  \n [ edit ] Karl Marx \n Main article: Karl Marx \n \n \n \n  \nKarl Marx, founder of Marxism. \n \n \n \n "Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution." \n \xe2\x80\x94&#160;Karl Marx, 1844 [ 7 ] \n \n In the 1840s, a German philosopher and sociologist named Karl Marx (1818\xe2\x80\x931883), who was living in England after fleeing the authorities in the German states, where he was considered a political threat, began publishing books in which he outlined his theories for a variety of communism now known as Marxism . Marx was financially aided and supported by another German \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9, Friedrich Engels (1820\xe2\x80\x931895), who like Marx had fled from the German authorities in 1849. [ 8 ] Marx and Engels took on many influences from earlier philosophers; politically, they were influenced by Maximilien Robespierre and several other radical figures of the French Revolution, whilst economically they were influenced by David Ricardo and philosophically they were influenced by Hegel . [ 9 ] Engels regularly met Marx at Chetham\'s Library in Manchester , England from 1845 and the alcove where they met remains identical to this day. [ 10 ]  [ 11 ] It was here Engels relayed his experiences of industrial Manchester, chronicled in the Condition of the Working Class in England , highlighting the struggles of the working class. \n Marx stated that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles ," something that he believed was happening between the bourgeoisie who then controlled society and the proletariat (the working class masses) who toiled to produce everything but who had no political control. He purported the idea that human society moved through a series of progressive stages, from primitive communism through to slavery , feudalism and then capitalism, and that this in turn would be replaced by communism - for Marx therefore, communism was seen as inevitable, as well as desirable. \n Marx founded the Communist Correspondence Committee in 1846 through which the various communists, socialists and other leftists across Europe could keep in contact with one another in the face of political oppression. He then published The Communist Manifesto in 1848, which would prove to be one of the most influential communist texts ever written. He subsequently began work on a multi-volume epic that would examine and criticise the capitalist economy and the effect that it had upon politics, society and philosophy; the first volume of the work, which was known as Capital:Critique of Political Economy , was published in 1869. However, Marx and Engels were not only interested in writing about communism, they were also active in supporting revolutionary activity that would lead to the creation of communist governments across Europe. They helped to found the International Workingmen\'s Association , which would later become known as the First International , to unite various communists and socialists, and Marx was elected to the Association\'s General Council. [ 12 ] \n [ edit ] Early development of Marxism \n During the latter half of the 19th century, various left-wing organisations across Europe continued to campaign against the many autocratic right-wing regimes that were then in power. In France in 1871, socialists set up a government known as the Paris Commune after the fall of Napoleon III , however they were soon overthrown and many of their members executed by counter-revolutionaries. [ 13 ] Meanwhile Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels joined the German Social-Democratic Party , which had been created in 1875, but which was outlawed in 1879 by the German government, then led by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck , who deemed it to be a political threat due to its revolutionary nature and increasing number of supporters. [ 14 ] In 1890, the party was re-legalised, and by this time it had fully adopted Marxist principles. It subsequently achieved a fifth of the vote in the German elections, and some of its leaders, such as August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht , became well-known public figures. [ 15 ] \n At the time, Marxism took off not only in Germany, but it also gained popularity in Hungary , the Habsburg Monarchy and the Netherlands , although did not achieve such success in other European nations like the United Kingdom , where Marx and Engels had been based. [ 16 ] Nonetheless, the new political ideology had gained sufficient support that an organisation was founded known as the Second International to unite the various Marxist groups around the world. [ 17 ] \n \n \n \n "The communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win." \n \n \n Karl Marx \n \n However, as Marxism took off, it also began to come under criticism from other European intellectuals, including fellow socialists and leftists; the Russian collectivist anarchist Mikhail Bakunin for instance criticised what he believed were the flaws in the Marxian theory that the state would eventually dissolve under a Marxist government, instead he believed that the state would gain in power and become authoritarian . Criticism also came from other sociologists, such as the German Max Weber , who whilst admiring Marx, disagreed with many of his assumptions on the nature of society. Some Marxists tried to adapt to these criticisms and the changing nature of capitalism, for instance Eduard Bernstein emphasised the idea of Marxists bringing legal challenges against the current administrations over the treatment of the working classes rather than simply emphasising violent revolution as more orthodox Marxists did. Other Marxists opposed Bernstein and other revisionists, with many, including Karl Kautsky , Otto Bauer , Rudolf Hilferding , Rosa Luxemburg , Vladimir Lenin , and Georgi Plekhanov sticking steadfast to the concept of violently overthrowing what they saw as the bourgeoisie-controlled government and instead establishing a " dictatorship of the proletariat ." \n [ edit ] International communism: periodization \n The Comintern\'s historical existence is divided among periods, regarding changes in the general policy it followed. [ 18 ]  [ 19 ]  [ 20 ] \n \n The War Communism period (1919-1923) which saw the forming of the International, the Russian Civil War . a general revolutionary upheaval after the October Revolution resulting in the formation of the first Communist Parties across the world, and the defeat of workers\' revolutionary movements in Germany, Hungary, Finland and Poland. \n \n \n The New Economic Policy period (1923-1929) which marked the end of the civil war in Russia and new economic measures taken by the Bolshevik government, the toning down of the revolutionary wave in Europe, and internal struggles within the Bolshevik Party and the Comintern after Lenin\'s death and before Stalin\'s absolute consolidation of power. \n \n \n The Third Period (1929-1934), an ultra-left turn which saw rapid industrialization and collectivization in the Soviet Union under Stalin\'s rule, the refusal by Communists to cooperate with Social Democrats in other countries (labeling them " social fascists ", and the ultimate rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, which led to the abandonment of the hard-line policy of this period. These years also saw the complete subordination of all Communist Parties across the world to the directives of the Soviet Party, making the Comintern more or less an organ of the CPSU. \n \n \n The Popular Front period (1934-1939). It marked the call by Comintern to all popular and democratic forces (not just Communist) to unite in Popular Fronts against fascism. Products of this period were the Popular Front governments in France and Spain. However, this period was also marked by widespread purges of anyone suspected as an enemy of the Stalinist regime, both in the Soviet Union and abroad. These mass purges resulted in the breaking up of the Popular Front in Spain amidst the Spanish Civil War and the fall of Spain to Francisco Franco . \n \n \n The period of " advocating peace " (1939-1941), a result of the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact . In this period, communists were advocating non-participation in World War II , labeling the war as "imperialist". A new term, "revolutionary defeatism" was coined by Comintern in this period, referring to anti-war propaganda by communists in the Western Europe against their national governments. \n \n \n The Great Patriotic War period, sometimes called the Second Popular Front (1941-1943). This was the last period of the Comintern, starting immediately after the German invasion of the USSR , with Stalin\'s 3 July 1941 call to the entire free world to unite and fight Nazism by all means. This was a period of militant anti-fascism , the emergence of national liberation movements all across occupied Europe, and ultimately the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943. \n \n \n The Early Cold War 1947-1960 in which the Soviet Union and the red Army installed the communist regime\'s in most of Eastern Europe (except for Yugoslavia and Albania, which had independent communist regimes). A major effort to support Communist Party activity in Western democracies, especially Italy and France, fell short of gaining positions in the government. \n \n \n The Late Cold War 1960-1970s, in which China turned against the Soviet Union, and organized alternative Communist parties in many countries. Intense attention was given to revolutionary movements in the 3rd World, which were successful in some places such as Cuba and Vietnam. Communism was decisively defeated in other states, including Malaya and Indonesia. In 1972-79, there was d\xc3\xa9tente between the Soviet Union and the United States. \n \n \n The End of communism in Europe, 1980-91, in which Soviet client states were heavily on the defensive, as in Afghanistan and Nicaragua. The United States escalated the conflict with very heavy military spending. After a series of failed leaders, Michael Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin and began a policy of glasnost and perestroika, designed to revive the failing Soviet economy. European satellites grew increasingly independent, led by Poland, and in 1989 they all spelled the Communist leadership. East Germany merged into West Germany, with Moscow\'s approval. In 1991, communism collapsed in the Soviet Union. Communist parties around the world either collapsed, or became independent non-communist entities. However, China, North Korea, Vietnam and Cuba maintained communist regimes. China after 1980 adopted a market oriented economy that welcomed large-scale trade and friendly relations with United States. \n \n [ edit ] The Early Communist States (1917\xe2\x80\x931947) \n [ edit ] The Russian Revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nVladimir Lenin \n \n \n Main article: Russian Revolution (1917) \n At the start of the 20th century, the Russian Empire was an autocracy controlled by the Tsar , with millions of the country\'s largely agrarian population living in abject poverty , and as the anti-communist historian Robert Service noted, "poverty and oppression constituted the best soil for Marxism to grow in." [ 21 ] The man responsible for largely introducing the ideology into the country was Georgi Plekhanov , although the movement itself was largely organised by a man known as Vladimir Lenin , who had for a time been exiled to a prison camp in Siberia by the Tsarist government for his beliefs. [ 22 ] A Marxist group known as the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was formed in the country, although it soon divided into two main factions; the Bolsheviks , who were led by Lenin, and the Mensheviks , who were led by Julius Martov . In 1905, there was a revolution against the Tsar\'s rule, in which workers\' councils, known as " soviets " were formed in many parts of the country, and the Tsar was forced to implement democratic reform, introducing an elected government, the Duma . [ 23 ] \n In 1917, with further social unrest against the Duma and its part in involving Russia in the First World War , the Bolsheviks took power in the October Revolution . They subsequently began remodelling the country based upon communist principles, nationalising various industries and confiscating land from wealthy aristocrats and redistributing it amongst the peasants. They subsequently pulled out of the war against Germany by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk , which was unpopular amongst many in Russia for it gave away large areas of land to Germany. From the outset, the new government faced counter-revolutionary resistance from a myriad of forces, including anarchists , scattered tsarist resistance forces known as the White Guard , and Western powers, leading to the events of the Russian civil war , which the Bolsheviks won and subsequently consolidated their power over the entire country, centralising power from the Kremlin in the capital city of Moscow . In 1922, the Russian Empire was officially redesignated to be the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , whilst in 1924 Lenin resigned as leader of the Union due to poor health, and soon died, with Joseph Stalin subsequently taking over control. \n [ edit ] Comintern, Mongolia and the communist uprisings in Europe \n \n \n \n  \nComintern published a theoretical magazine in a variety of European languages from 1919 to 1943. \n \n \n In 1919, the Bolshevik government in Russia organised the creation of an international communist organisation that would act as the Third International after the collapse of the Second International in 1916 - this was known as the Communist International, although was commonly abbreviated as Comintern . Throughout its existence, Comintern would be dominated by the Kremlin despite its internationalist stance. Meanwhile, in 1921 the Soviet Union invaded its neighbouring Mongolia to aid a popular uprising against the imperialist Chinese who then controlled the country, instituting a Marxist government, which declared the nation to be the Mongolian People\'s Republic in 1924. [ 24 ] \n Comintern and other such Soviet-backed communist groups soon spread across much of the world, though particularly in Europe, where the influence of the recent Russian Revolution was still strong. In Germany , the Spartacist uprising took place in 1919, when armed communists supported rioting workers, but the government put the rebellion down violently with the use of a right-wing paramilitary group, the Freikorps , with many noted German communists, such as Rosa Luxemburg , being killed. [ 25 ] Within a few months, a group of communists seized power amongst public unrest in the German region of Bavaria , forming the Bavarian Soviet Republic , although once more this was put down violently by the Freikorps, who historians believe killed around 1200 communists and their sympathisers. [ 26 ] \n That same year, political turmoil in Hungary following their defeat in the First World War led to a coalition government of the Social-Democratic Party and the Communist Party taking control. The communists, led by Bela Kun , soon became dominant and instituted various communist reforms in the country, however the country was subsequently invaded by its neighbouring Romania within a matter of months who overthrew the government, with the communist leaders either escaping abroad or being executed. [ 27 ] In 1921, a communist revolt against the government occurred whilst supportive factory workers were on strike in Turin and Milan , northern Italy , however the government acted swiftly and put down the rebellion. [ 28 ] That same year, a further communist rebellion took place in Germany, only to be crushed, but another occurred in 1923, which once again was also defeated by the government. [ 29 ] The communists of Bulgaria had also attempted an uprising in 1923 but like most of their counterparts across Europe, they were defeated. [ 30 ] \n [ edit ] Front organisations \n Communist parties were tight knit organisations that exerted tight control over the members. To reach sympathisers unwilling to join the party, front organisations were created that advocated party-approved positions. The Comintern , under the leadership of Grigory Zinoviev in the Kremlin, established fronts in many countries in the 1920s and after. To coordinate their activities the Comintern set up various international umbrella organizations (linking groups across national borders), such as the Young Communist International (youth), Profintern (trade unions), [ 31 ]  Krestintern (peasants), International Red Aid (humanitarian aid), Sportintern (organized sports), etc. In Europe, front organizations were especially influential in Italy [ 32 ] and France, which in 1933 became the base for Communist front organizer Willi M\xc3\xbcnzenberg . [ 33 ] These organizations were dissolved the late 1930s or early 1940s. \n The Pan-Pacific Trade Union Secretariat (PPTUS) was set up in 1927 by the Profintern (the Comintern\'s trade union arm) with the mission of promoting Communist trade unions in China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and other nations in the western Pacific. [ 34 ] Trapeznik (2009) says the PPTUS was a "Communist-front organization" and "engaged in overt and covert political agitation in addition to a number of clandestine activities." [ 35 ] \n There were numerous Communist front organizations in Asia, many oriented to students and youth. [ 36 ] In Japan in the labor union movement of the 1920s, according to one historian, "The Hyogikai never called itself a communist front but in effect, this was what it was." He points out it was repressed by the government "along with other communist front groups." [ 37 ] In the 1950s, Scalapino argues, "The primary Communist-front organization was the Japan Peace Committee." It was founded in 1949. [ 38 ] \n [ edit ] Stalinism in the Soviet Union \n In 1924, Joseph Stalin , a key Bolshevik follower of Lenin, took power in the Soviet Union. [ 39 ] He was supported in his leadership by Nikolai Bukharin but had various important opponents in the government, most notably Leon Trotsky , Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev . Stalin initiated his own process of building a communist society, creating a variant of communism known as Stalinism and as a part of this he abandoned some of the capitalist, free market policies that had been allowed to continue under Lenin, such as the New Economic Policy . He radically altered much of the Union\'s agricultural production, modernising it by introducing tractors and other machinery, by forced collectivisation of the farms, by forced collection of grains from the peasants in accordance with predecided targets. There was food available for industrial workers, but those peasants who refused to move starved especially in the Ukraine. The Party targeted " Kulaks " (who owned a little land). \n Stalin took control of the Comintern, and introduced a policy in the international organisation of opposing all leftists who were not Marxists, labelling them to be "social-fascists", although many communists, such as Jules Humbert-Droz , disagreed with him on this policy, believing that the left should unite against the rise of right wing movements like fascism across Europe. [ 40 ] In the early 1930s Stalin reversed course and promoted "Popular Front" movements whereby Communist parties would collaborate with Socialists and other political forces. A high priority was mobilizing wide support for the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War . [ 41 ] \n [ edit ] The Great Terror \n The " Great Terror " mainly operated from Dec. 1936 to Nov. 1938, although, the features of arrest and summary trial followed by execution were well entrenched in the Soviet system since the days of Lenin, as Stalin systematically destroyed the older generation of pre-1918 leaders, usually on the grounds they were enemy spies or simply because they were " enemies of the people ". In the Army, a majority of generals were executed. Hundreds of thousands of other "enemies" were sent to the Gulag , [ 42 ] where terrible conditions in Siberia led quickly to death. [ 43 ] \n [ edit ] Pre-war dissident communisms \n The International Right Opposition and Trotskyism are examples of dissidents who still claim communism today, but they are not the only ones. In Germany, the split in the SPD had initially led to a variety of Communist unions and parties forming, which included the councilist tendencies of the AAU-D AAU-E and KAPD . Councilism had a limited impact outside of Germany, but a number of international organisations formed. In Spain, a fusion of Left and Right dissidents led to the formation of the POUM . Additionally, in Spain, the CNT was associated with the development of the FAI political party, a non-Marxist party which stood for revolutionary communism. \n [ edit ] Spreading Communism (1945\xe2\x80\x931957) \n As the Cold War took effect around 1947, the Kremlin set up new international coordination bodies including the World Federation of Democratic Youth , International Union of Students , World Federation of Trade Unions , Women\'s International Democratic Federation and the World Peace Council . Kennedy says the, "Communist \'front\' system included such international organizations as the WFTU, WFDY, IUS, WIDF and WPC, besides a host of lesser bodies bringing journalists, lawyers, scientists, doctors and others into the widespread net." [ 44 ] \n The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) was established in 1945 to unite trade union confederations across the world; it was based in Prague. While it had non-Communist unions it was largely dominated by the Soviets. In 1949 the British, American and other non-Communist unions broke away to form the rival International Confederation of Free Trade Unions . The labor movement in Europe became so polarized between the Communists unions and the and Social Democratic and Christian labor unions, and front operations could no longer hide the sponsorship and they became less important. [ 45 ] \n [ edit ] Soviet Union \n The devastation of the war resulted in a massive recovery program involving the rebuilding of industrial plants, housing, and transportation, as well as the demobilization and migration of millions of soldiers and civilians. In the midst of this turmoil during the winter of 1946\xe2\x80\x931947 the Soviet Union experienced the worst natural famine in the 20th century. [ 46 ] There was no serious opposition to Stalin, as the secret police continued to send possible suspects to the "Gulag." \n Relations with the US and Britain went from friendly to hostile; they denounced Stalin\'s political controls over eastern Europe and his blockade of Berlin. By 1947, the Cold War had begun. Stalin himself believed that capitalism was a hollow shell and would crumble under increased non-military pressure exerted through proxies in countries like Italy. He greatly underestimated the economic strength of the West, and instead of triumph saw the West build up alliances designed to permanently stop or "contain" Soviet expansion. In early 1950 Stalin gave the go-ahead for North Korea\'s invasion of South Korea, expecting a short war. He was stunned when the Americans entered and defeated the North Koreans, putting them almost on the Soviet border. Stalin supported China\'s entry into the Korean war, which drove the Americans back to the prewar boundaries, but which escalated tensions. The US decided to mobilize its economy for a long contest with the Soviets, built the hydrogen bomb, and strengthened the NATO alliance that covered western Europe. [ 47 ] \n According to Gorlizki and Khlevniuk (2004), Stalin\'s consistent and overriding goal after 1945 was to consolidate the nation\'s superpower status and, in the face of his growing physical decrepitude, to maintain his own hold on total power. Stalin created a leadership system that reflected historic czarist styles of paternalism and repression, yet was also quite modern. At the top personal loyalty to Stalin counted for everything. However, Stalin also created powerful committees, elevated younger specialists, and began major institutional innovations. In the teeth of persecution, Stalin\'s deputies cultivated informal norms and mutual understandings which provided the foundations for collective rule after his death. [ 48 ] \n [ edit ] Eastern Europe \n The military success of the Red Army in Central and Eastern Europe led to a consolidation of power in Communist hands. In some cases, such as Czechoslovakia, this led to an enthusiastic support for socialism inspired by the Communist Party and a Social Democratic Party willing to fuse. In other cases, such as Poland or Hungary, the fusion of the Communist Party with the Social Democratic party was forcible, and accomplished through undemocratic means. In many cases the Communist Parties of Central Europe were faced with a population initially quite willing to reign in market forces, institute limited nationalisation of industry, and supporting the development of intensive social welfare states: broadly, the population largely supported socialism. However, the purges of non-Communist parties which supported socialism, combined with forced collectivisation of agriculture, and a Soviet-bloc wide recession in 1953 led to deep unrest. This unrest first surfaced in Berlin in 1953, where Brecht ironically suggested the that Party ought to elect a new People. However, Khrushchev\'s Secret Speech of 1956 opened up internal debate, even if members were unaware, in both the Polish and Hungarian Communist Parties. This led to the Polish Crisis of 1956 which was resolved through change in Polish leadership, and a negotiation between the Soviet and Polish parties over the direction of the Polish economy. \n [ edit ] Hungarian Revolution of 1956 \n Main article: Hungarian Revolution of 1956 \n The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 was a major challenge to Stalin\'s control of Eastern Europe. [ 49 ] This revolution saw general strikes, the formation of independent workers councils, the restoration of the Social Democratic Party as a party for revolutionary communism of a non-Soviet variety, and the formation of two underground independent communist parties. The mainstream Communist Party was controlled for a period of about a week by non-Soviet aligned leaders. Two non-communist parties which supported the maintenance of socialism also regained their independence. This flowering of dissenting communism was crushed by a combination of a military invasion supported by heavy artillery and airstrikes; mass arrests, at least a thousand juridicial executions and an uncounted number of summary executions; the crushing of the Central Workers Council of Greater Budapest; mass refugee flight; and a worldwide propaganda campaign. The effect of the Hungarian Revolution on other communist parties varied significantly, resulting in large membership losses in Anglophone communist parties. [ 50 ] \n [ edit ] Prague Spring 1968 \n Main article: Prague Spring \n The Czechoslovak Communist Party began an ambitious reform agenda under Alexander Dubcek . The plan to limit central control and make the economy more independent of the party threatened bedrock beliefs. On 20 August 1968, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev ordered a massive military invasion by Warsaw Pact forces that destroyed the threat of internal liberalization. [ 51 ] At the same time the Soviets threatened retaliation against the British-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt. The upshot was a collapse of any tendency toward d\xc3\xa9tente, and the resignations of more intellectuals from Parties in the West. [ 52 ] \n [ edit ] West Germany \n West Germany (and West Berlin) were centers of East-West conflict during the Cold War, and numerous Communist fronts were established. For example the Society for German-Soviet Friendship (GfDSF) had 13,000 members in West Germany, but it was banned in 1953 by some L\xc3\xa4nder as a Communist front. [ 53 ] The Democratic Cultural League of Germany started off as a series of genuinely pluralistic bodies, but in 1950\xe2\x80\x9351 came under the control of Communists. By 1952 the U.S. Embassy counted 54 \'infiltrated organizations\', which started independently, as well as 155 \'front organizations\', which had been Communist inspired from their start. [ 54 ] \n The Association of the Victims of the Nazi Regime was set up to rally West Germans under the antifascist banner, but had to be dissolved when Moscow discovered it had been infiltrated by "Zionist agents". [ 55 ] \n [ edit ] China\'s Great Leap Forward \n \n \n \n  \nChairman Mao Zedong proclaiming the establishment of the People\'s Republic in 1949. \n \n \n Mao Zedong and the Communist party came to power in China in 1949, as the Nationalists fled to the island of Formosa. In 1950-53 China engaged in a large-scale but undeclared war with the United States, South Korea and United Nations forces in the Korean War . It ended in a military stalemate, but it gave Mao the opportunity to identify and purge elements in China that seemed supportive of capitalism. At first there was close cooperation with the Stalin, who sent in technical experts to aid the industrialization process along the line of the Soviet model of the 1930s. [ 56 ] After Stalin\'s death in 1953 relations with Moscow soured\xe2\x80\x94Mao thought Stalin\'s successors had betrayed the Communist ideal. Mao charged that Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was the leader of a "revisionist clique" which had turned against Marxism and Leninism was now setting the stage for the restoration of capitalism. [ 57 ] The two nations were at sword\'s point by 1960. Both began forging alliances with Communist supporters around the globe, thereby splitting the worldwide movement into two hostile camps. [ 58 ] \n Rejecting the Soviet model of rapid urbanization, Mao Zedong and his top aide Deng Xiaoping launched the " Great Leap Forward " in 1957-61 with the goal of industrializing China overnight, using the peasant villages as the base rather than large cities. [ 59 ] Private ownership of land ended and the peasants worked in large collective farms that were now ordered to start up heavy industry operations, such as steel mills. Plants were built in remote locations, despite the lack of technical experts, managers, transportation or needed facilities. Industrialization failed but the main result was a sharp unexpected decline in agricultural output, which led to mass famine and millions of deaths. The years of the Great Leap Forward in fact saw economic regression, with 1958 through 1961 being the only years between 1953 and 1983 in which China\'s economy saw negative growth. Political economist Dwight Perkins argues, "enormous amounts of investment produced only modest increases in production or none at all. \xe2\x80\xa6 In short, the Great Leap was a very expensive disaster. [ 60 ] Deng, put in charge of rescuing the economy, adopted pragmatic policies that the idealistic Mao disliked. Mao for a while was in the shadows, but he returned to center stage and purged Deng and his allies in the "cultural revolution" (1966-1969). [ 61 ] \n [ edit ] Early post-war dissident Communisms \n Following the Second World War Trotskyism was wracked by increasing internal divisions over analysis and strategy. This was combined with an industrial impotence that was widely recognised. Additionally, the success of Soviet-aligned parties in Europe and Asia led to the persecution of Trotskyite intellectuals, such as the infamous purge of Vietnamese Trotskyists. The war had also strained Social Democratic parties in the West. In some cases, such as Italy, significant bodies of membership of the Social Democratic Party were inspired by the possibility of achieving advanced socialism. In Italy this group, combined with dissenting communists, began to discuss theory centred on the experience of work in modern factories, leading to Autonomist Marxism . In the United States this theoretical development was paralleled by the Johnston-Forrest tendency. In France a similar impulse occurred. \n [ edit ] The Cold War and Revisionism (1957\xe2\x80\x931979) \n [ edit ] Maoism and the Cultural Revolution in China \n Main articles: Maoism and Cultural Revolution \n The Cultural Revolution was an upheaval that targeted intellectuals and party leaders from 1966 through 1976. Mao\'s goal was to purify communism by removing pro-capitalists and traditionalists by imposing Maoist orthodoxy within the Party. The movement paralyzed China politically and weakened the country economically, culturally and intellectually for years. Millions of people were accused, humiliated, stripped of power, and either imprisoned, killed, or\xe2\x80\x94most often\xe2\x80\x94sent to work as farm laborers. Mao insisted that these " revisionists " be removed through violent class struggle . The two most prominent militants were Marshall Lin Biao of the army and Mao\'s wife Jiang Qing . China\'s youth responded to Mao\'s appeal by forming Red Guard groups around the country. The movement spread into the military, urban workers, and the Communist Party leadership itself. It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life. In the top leadership, it led to a mass purge of senior officials who were accused of taking a "capitalist road", most notably Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping . During the same period Mao\'s personality cult grew to immense proportions. After Mao\'s death in 1976 the survivors were rehabilitated and many returned to power. [ 62 ] \n [ edit ] The Cuban Revolution \n Main article: Cuban Revolution \n The Cuban Revolution was a successful armed revolt led by Fidel Castro \'s 26th of July Movement against the regime of Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista . It ousted Batista on 1 January 1959, replacing his regime with Castro\'s revolutionary government. Castro\'s government later reformed along communist lines, becoming the present Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965. [ 63 ] The U.S. response was highly negative, leading to a failed invasion attempt in 1961 . The Soviets decided to protect its ally by stationing nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962. In the Cuban Missile Crisis the U.S. vehemently opposed the Soviet move. There was serious fear of nuclear war for a few days but a compromise was reached by which Moscow publicly removed its weapons, and the U.S. secretly removed its from bases in Turkey and promised never to invade. [ 64 ] \n [ edit ] Eurocommunism \n Main article: Eurocommunism \n An important trend in several countries in Western Europe from the late 1960s into the 1980s was " Eurocommunism ." It was strongest in Spain\'s PCE , Finland\'s party and, especially in Italy\'s PCI , where it drew on the ideas of Antonio Gramsci . It was developed by members of the Communist Party who were disillusioned with both the Soviet Union and China, and sought an independent program. They accepted liberal parliamentary democracy and free speech, and with some conditions accepted a capitalist market economy. They did not speak of the destruction of capitalism but sought to win the support of the masses and by a gradual transformation of the bureaucracies. In 1978 Spain\'s PCE replaced the historic "Marxist-Leninist" catchphrase with the new slogan, "Marxist, democratic, and revolutionary." The movement faded in the 1980s and collapsed with the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989. [ 65 ] \n [ edit ] The Collapse of the Communist Powers (1980\xe2\x80\x931992) \n Main article: Revolutions of 1989 \n [ edit ] Contemporary Communism (1993-Present) \n Further information: List of communist and anti-capitalist parties with parliamentary representation \n With the fall of the communist governments in the Soviet Union and the eastern bloc, the power that the state-based Marxist ideologies held on the world was weakened, but there are still many communist movements of various types and sizes around the world. Three other communist nations, particularly those in eastern Asia, the People\'s Republic of China, Vietnam and Laos, all moved toward market economies but without major privatization of the state sector during the 1980s and 1990s; see Socialism with Chinese characteristics and doi moi for more details. [ citation needed ] Spain , France , Portugal and Greece have very publicly strong communist movements that play an open and active leading role in the vast majority of their labor marches and strikes, and also anti-austerity protests , all of which are large, pronounced events with much visibility. Also, worldwide marches on International Workers Day sometimes give a clearer picture of the size and influence of current communist movements, particularly within Europe. \n Cuba has recently emerged from the crisis sparked by the fall of the Soviet Union given the growth in its volume of trade with its new allies Venezuela and China (the former of whom has recently adopted a "Socialism for the 21st Century" according to Hugo Chavez ). Various other countries throughout South and Latin America have also taken similar shifts to more clearly socialistic policies and rhetoric, in a phenomenon academics are calling the " pink tide ". \n North Korea has had less success in coping with the collapse of the Soviet bloc than its counterparts, which led that government to "supersede" its original Marxism-Leninism with an ideology called Juche . For this reason among others, there are no significant communist movements, whether State-based or local, who consider North Korea to have any connection to communism whatsoever. Cuba, however, does apparently have an ambassador to North Korea, and China still protects North Korean territorial integrity even as it simultaneously refuses to supply the state with material goods or other significant assistance. \n In Nepal , the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) leader Man Mohan Adhikari briefly became Prime Minister and national leader from 1994 to 1995, and the Maoist guerrilla leader Prachanda was elected Prime Minister by the Constituent Assembly of Nepal in 2008. Prachanda has since been deposed as PM, leading the Maoists to abandon their legalistic approach and return to their typical street actions and militancy and to lead sporadic general strikes using their quite substantial influence on the Nepalese labor movement. These actions have oscillated between mild and intense, only the latter of which tends to make world news. They consider Prachanda\'s removal to be unjust. \n The previous national government of India depended on the parliamentary support of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) , and CPI(M) leads the state governments in West Bengal , Kerala and Tripura . The armed wing of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) is fighting a war against the government of India and is active in half the country; the Indian government has recently declared the Maoists its chief objective to eliminate. \n In Cyprus , the veteran communist Dimitris Christofias of AKEL won the 2008 presidential election. \n In Moldova , the communist party won the 2001, 2005 and 2009 parliamentary elections. However, the April 2009 Moldovan elections results, in which the communists supposedly won a third time, were massively protested (including an attack on the Parliament and Presidency buildings by angry crowds) and another round was held on July 29 in which three opposition parties (the Liberals, Liberal-Democrats, and Democrats)won and formed the Alliance for European Integration. However failing to elect the president, new parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 which resulted in roughly the same representation in the Parliament. According to Ion Marandici, a Moldovan political scientist the Moldovan Communists differ from those in other countries, because they managed to appeal to the ethnic minorities and the anti-Romanian Moldovans. After tracing the adaptation strategy of the Party of Communists from Republic of Moldova, he finds confirming evidence for five of the factors contributing to the electoral success, already mentioned in the theoretical literature on former Communist parties: the economic situation, the weakness of the opponents, the electoral laws, the fragmentation of the political spectrum and the legacy of the old regime. However, Ion Marandici identified seven additional explanatory factors at work in the Moldovan case: the foreign support for certain political parties, separatism, the appeal to the ethnic minorities, the alliance-building capacity, the reliance on the Soviet notion of the Moldovan identity, the state-building process and the control over a significant portion of the media. It is due to these seven additional factors that the successor party in Moldova managed to consolidate and expand its constituency. According to Ion Marandici, in the post-Soviet area the Moldovan Communists are the only ones who have been in power for so long and did not change the name of the party. [ 66 ] \n In Ukraine and Russia , the communists came second in the 2002 and 2003 elections, respectively. In the Czech Republic , the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia came third in the 2002 elections, as did the Communist Party of Portugal in 2005. \n Brazil has the Communist Party of Brazil as a member of the governing leftwing coalition led by president Lula da Silva ; his party, Workers\' Party (Brazil) , itself has many different communist and democratic socialist tendencies within it. \n In South Africa , the South African Communist Party (SACP) is a member of the Tripartite alliance alongside the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions . Sri Lanka has communist ministers in their national governments. \n Colombia is in the midst of a civil war which has been waged since 1966 between the Colombian government and aligned rightwing paramilitaries against two communist guerrilla groups; the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People\'s Army (FARC-EP) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). \n The Philippines is still experiencing a low scale guerrilla insurgency by the New People\'s Army . \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  Service (2007:14-15) \n ^  Service (2007:15) \n ^  Service (2007:16) \n ^  David Priestland (2010) The Red Flag: Communism and the Making of the Modern World .

S'Communism vs Socialism - Difference and Comparison | Diffen \n   \n   \n    \n \n\t \n \n \n \n  \n   Communism vs Socialism \n     \n    Diffen \xe2\x80\xba      \n      Economics \n        \n     \n   In a way, communism is an extreme form of socialism . Many countries have dominant socialist political parties but very few are truly communist. In fact, most countries - including staunch capitalist bastions like the U.S. and U.K. - have government programs that borrow from socialist principles. " Socialism " is sometimes used interchangeably with " communism " but the two philosophies have some stark differences. Most notably, while communism is a political system, socialism is primarily an economic system that can exist in various forms under a wide range of political systems.\n \n\t\t Comparison chart \n   \n    \n     \n      \n      Communism \n      Socialism \n     \n    \n    Philosophy:     From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. Free-access to the articles of consumption is made possible by advances in technology that allow for super-abundance \n     From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution. Emphasis on profit being distributed among the society or workforce in addition to receiving a wage. \n     Definition:     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the community or state \n     A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of most property in common, with actual ownership ascribed to the workers \n     Political System:     No leader, directed directly by the people. This has never been actually practiced, and has just used a one-party system. \n     Multiple parties, but the ruling party usually goes by the name &quot;Socialist&quot;. \n     Social Structure:     All class distinctions are eliminated. \n     Class distinctions are diminished \n     Economic System:     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given equal shares of the benefits derived from labor. All means of production are controlled by the state. \n     Wealth redistributed so that everyone in society is given somewhat equal shares of the benefits derived from labor, but people can earn more if they work harder. Means of production are controlled by the workers themselves. \n     Free Choice:     In real communism, where a leader does not exist, everything is chosen freely.In those that have been practiced though, all choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are controlled by the state. \n     All choices, including education, religion, employment and marriage, are up to the individual. All health care and education is provided free to everybody \n     Ideas:     Human societies have always been divided into warring classes. The Industrial Revolution has enriched the wealthy and impoverished the poor. The workers must overthrow the bourgeois. \n     All people should be given an equal opportunity to succeed. Workers should have most say in their factory\'s management. The free market suffers from problems like tragedy of the commons. Government regulation is necessary. \n     Private Property:     Abolished \n     two kinds of property, private property, such as land, houses, clothing, etc. owned by the individual. Public property, factories, and means of production owned by the state but with worker control \n     Religion:     Abolished. \n     freedom of religion \n     Economic Coordination:     Government controls all business, as well as Business decisions. \n     Planned-Socialism relies principally on planning to determine investment and production decisions. Planning may be centralized or decentralized. Market-socialism relies on markets for allocating capital to different socially-owned enterprises. \n     Discrimination:     In theory, all members of the state are considered equal \n     The people are considered equal, laws are made when necessary to protect people from discrimination \n     Political Movements:     Leninism, Trotskyism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, Left-Communism \n     Democratic Socialism, Communism, Libertarian Socialism, Anarchism, Syndicalism \n     Key elements:     An enhanced form of the principle of &quot;Production for use&quot;. \n     Economic activity and production especially are adjusted to meet human needs and economic demands. &quot;Production for use&quot;: useful goods and services are produced specifically for their usefulness. \n     Ownership structure:     The means of production are commonly-owned, meaning no entity or individual owns productive property. Importance is ascribed to &quot;usership&quot; over &quot;ownership&quot;. \n     The means of production are socially-owned with the surplus value produced accruing to either all of society (in Public-ownership models) or to all the employee-members of the enterprise (in Cooperative-ownership models). \n     Key Proponents:     Karl Marx, Fredrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky \n     Robert Owen, Pierre Leroux, Karl Marx, Fredrick Engels, John Stuart Mill, Albert Einstein, George Bernard Shaw, Leo Tolstoy, Emma Goldman \n     Means of control:     Proletariat engages in violent rebellion. \n     Proletariat engages in taking charge of the factories and means of production. \n     Variations:     Include Marxism, Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism \n     libertarian-socialism, and anarcho-socialism, anarcho-syndicalism \n     Way of Change:     Government in a Communist-state is the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by government can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     Workers in a Socialist-state are the agent of change rather than any market or desire on the part of consumers. Change by the workers can be swift or slow, depending on change in ideology or even whim. \n     \n\n\n \n\t\t Contents \n \n 1 Economic differences between socialists and communists \n 2 Political differences \n 3 Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n 4 Related Articles \n 5 References \n   Economic differences between socialists and communists \n In a Socialist economy, the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy. On the other hand, in a communist society, there is no centralized government - there is a collective ownership of property and the organization of labor for the common advantage of all members.\n For a Capitalist society to transition, the first step is Socialism. From a capitalist system, it is easier to achieve the Socialist ideal where production is distributed according to people\'s deeds (quantity and quality of work done). For Communism (to distribute production according to needs ), it is necessary to first have production so high that there is enough for everyone\'s needs. In an ideal Communist society, people work not because they have to but because they want to and out of a sense of responsibility .\n \n  Political differences \n Socialism rejects a class-based society. But socialists believe that it is possible to make the transition from capitalism to socialism without a basic change in the character of the state. They hold this view because they do not think of the capitalist state as essentially an institution for the dictatorship of the capitalist class, but rather as a perfectly good piece of machinery which can be used in the interest of whichever class gets command of it. No need, then, for the working class in power to smash the old capitalist state apparatus and set up its own\xe2\x80\x94the march to socialism can be made step by step within the framework of the democratic forms of the capitalist state. Socialism is primarily an economic system so it exists in varying degrees and forms in a wide variety of political systems.\n On the other hand, communists believe that as soon as the working class and its allies are in a position to do so they must make a basic change in the character of the state; they must replace capitalist dictatorship over the working class with workers\xe2\x80\x99 dictatorship over the capitalist class as the first step in the process by which the existence of capitalists as a class (but not as individuals) is ended and a classless society is eventually ushered in.\n \n  Video: Socialism vs. Communism \n This is a very opinionated video that explains the differences between communism and socialism.\n \n \n  Related Articles \n Capitalism vs Socialism \n Liberal vs Conservative \n Democrat vs Republican \n Communism vs Fascism \n Communism vs Democracy \n \n  References \n http://www.marxmail.org/faq/socialism_and_communism.htm \n http://www.etext.org/Politics/MIM/faq/commievssoc.html \n http://www.romm.org/soc_com.html \n http://www.pww.org/past-weeks-1999/Socialism%20and%20communism.htm \n \n   \n    \n         \n     Comments: Communism vs Socialism \n     Comment anonymously \n      Anonymous comments     \n     Socialists has been in america since the late 1800s and has played an important role in organizing strikes and unions in the country. With out them there may have been a lot more starving people during the great depression \n     165.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.67 on 2013-04-17 12:24:25 \n         \n     to the guy who said why socialism aka communism doesn\'t work.\r\n\r\nSocialism and communism are not at all the same thing as they differ in many ways. A socialism has never existed. as a true socialism is one that the government fully regulates major companies and still lets there be private industry still alive to allow growth as well as the stability of a well controlled industry \n     209.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.251 on 2013-03-20 14:48:58 \n         \n     All of you ignore the basic instincts of human nature. If any of you would understand that, you would also understand why socialism aka communism simply does not work and is simply an utopia. Acording to marx, capitalism unevitably will lead to socialism, and socialism to communism. Is like fore play and sex, one lead to the other. At least thats how it was suposed to be through marx\'s eyes. Yes, there is a socialist tendency in this country, is been here ever since the 50\'s if I\'m not mistaken. Just take a look back and see the violent manifestations in the past of socialist suporters in this country. Marx also promotes that. When it became a big deal to identifie oneself as socialist in this country, and the socialist party went under ground, its members went under the umbrela of the democratic party, and were forced to change their estrategy. now they are tring to indoctrinate kids in schools and universities whith out them even noticing what they are being indoctrinated with. For all of you that want to know about marxism, you need to get your hands on marx and engels books and read them. Then see how such line of thinking have worked in the past for socialist and communist countries and how is working for europe, which is on the verge of total bankrupcy and economic desaster. Also check how is working for this country. Do you see total disaster coming for this country should socialists continue to get a hold to the government? I do. Is just a mater of time. Wake up and be realistic and pragmatic. because of our very nature, it is totaly impossible to have a socialist sistem all perfect as discribed by marx utopia, because we are all corrupt. Power corrupts. Capitalism may not be perfect, even corrupt if you will, but is, with out room for doubts, the best sistem there is and this great nation speaks loudly to that reality. Socialism aka communism(is all the same thing) takes everything away from the rich and turns the poor into a slave. socialism paves the road for totalitarism in time. I know, for I,ve lived it and studied it; very well indoctrinated with marx and engels books and dialectical materialism. As far as I\'m concerned I would domp all of marx books in the septic tank for what they are worth. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.6 on 2013-02-28 04:29:29 \n         \n     To the person in \'Anonymous Comments\' who said, &quot;liberals don\'t want to see the poor get education&quot;. Are you kidding me? What country do you live in? Remember it\'s the liberals/left who fight for everyone to have an equal chance at education.\r\nIt\'s the right/Repubs who stop at nothing to prevent any sort of funding to assist people to help them get better education!\r\nHave you been smoking dope or something? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:43:21 \n         \n     Indeed, there has never been a true communist state. Remember, in true communism everyone is equal across the board. But in every so called communist country certain members of society received special favor ... in the USSR you got a bigger apartment if you were an Olympic star for example. That is not communism.\r\nBottom line, there has never been any true pure form of any communism, socialism or capitalism based country ever.\r\nIn America it\'s schools, mail system, police and fire departments are all forms of socialism.\r\nThese numbskulls who scream that Obama is a Nazi Socialist or Communist haven\'t a clue. Yet at the same time scream &quot;if you don\'t believe like me... you\'re un-American&quot; and &quot;my country right OR wrong&quot;. If anything these types of viewpoints that most right-wingers have are exactly the types that helped fuel the Nazi movement in Germany. How ironic ( read, scary) is that? \n     66.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.110 on 2013-01-19 19:30:12 \n         \n     Socialistic ideologies aren\'t as bad as you would think. I believe that one if the first societies to use it was the Roman Empire. They flourished under socialist ideas. I\'m not saying the country should be 100% socialist, but rather take some ideologies and put them to work in our society. \n     107.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.178 on 2013-01-01 14:47:07 \n         \n     Disgusting analysis performed by undereducated American sychophants. Communism produces a stateless society.There is no government, no currency, nothing of the nature of capitalist economics. The reason you have no understanding of it is that you attempt to put it under economic models ascribed to analyze capitalism. You cannot say that there is a single party in communism, because communism has no government. \n     76.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.33 on 2012-10-02 20:51:51 \n         \n     Of course, capitalism hampers the freedoms of everybody except the capitalist class just as much as the other systems; people work because they have to, their jobs are largely determined by economic mandates, not personal preference, and without stringent regulations, human rights abuses are as common and as severe as in communism. No system is perfect. \n     168.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.19 on 2012-06-21 04:01:27 \n         \n     Our republic should provide basic laws that generally protect the public harm, Capitalism provides the greatest freedom, who among us want to give up our free will to another man, not I. Every step away from capitalism to a socialistic/communistic system is simply tranferring some degree of our our freedom to another person or group and a step toward human rights violations that are prevalent in places like China (slavery). \r\n\r\nHuman nature dictates that individuals will prefer freedom over the other systems if they are educated to know the difference, this is why liberals prefer the poor don\'t get a useful education hence inner city grades. \r\n\r\nSome people will never be a doctor because the are either not smart enough or are not interested or generally does not suit that person, yet due to their individual likes may become very succsseful in ways no one could predict much less some bureaucrat. \n     70.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.158 on 2012-06-02 14:47:25 \n         \n     You have got this completely wrong Trotsky was a socialist you make socialism sound weak well it is not we believe in all the ideals you put forward for\r\nCommunism \n     86.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.215 on 2012-05-07 22:08:31 \n         \n     On 3/26/11 there was a comment that the free market system nearly brought down the world economy in 2008. I beg to differ! There are many who, through the propaganda spread by the left wing main stream media, believe that the present economic woes of the US and world are to be blamed on the Republicans and Capitalists. The problem started with the collapse of the mortgage industry which was brought on by our government sticking its nose into the free market system. As Republicans in congress were warning of the dangers of the subprime mortgage loans that were being made in 2008 and earlier, Barney Frank stood before the House and insisted that it was&quot;WORTH THE RISK&quot; to get more minorities into their own homes ----- whether or not they were credit worthy! Too many today want to blame the banks, forgetting that it was the government who twisted the arms of the banks to make these risky loans under the threat of hefty penalties if they did not comply. They forget that Obama himself, working for ACORN, sued Citibank over this very issue and Citibank caved in due to laws that had been put in place by an over-reaching Federal Government. And besides, the banks were safe as the risk was really being put on Fanny and Freddie -----THE TAX PAYERS! The banks, left to their own business wisdom would never have engaged in such shaky practices. It was the fault of the Democratic left wing Socialists, playing up to their base and trying to garner support, who believed that they should &quot;spread the wealth&quot;. Obama has often said that he inherited this economy from Bush but Bush was not running Congress ----- it was being run by the Democrat majority. Then the Morons in this country voted in the very people who caused the economic crash in the first place. There will always be the rich and the poor because there will always be the industrious and the slackers. Socialism/Communism always fails. Look at the Plymouth Plantation in 1620. They nearly died from starvation under communism and only prospered when they shifted to &quot;every man for himself&quot;. The Soviet Union collapsed because their economic engine had the constant drag of apathy caused by hopelessness ----- lack of opportunity to prosper. They could not compete with our economic engine ------ capitalism. Look at what is happening to the economies of Europe ------ they\'re imploding ------ too much consumption and not enough production. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.237 on 2012-01-02 01:43:09 \n         \n     Socialism is communism with lipstick on and is the stepping stone of losing your rights of proprietorship. Thats right,no more owning your own business or private property. Opportunities to Free Market Capitalism will be annihalated and there will be no more poor,middle or rich class people. The Socialists and Communists will tell you that its the best society and there will be no more racism or poverty.Try telling that to the 4.5 million people in the U.S.S.R who lost there lives as a direct result of Karl Marx\' &quot;Utopia&quot;. You would have to be a blithering idiot to co-sign on any form of socialism or communism. Capitalism may not be perfect but nothing on Planet Earth is,everything has pros and cons. There will always be greed,people who are homeless and hungry. At least Free Market Capitalism gives us an opportunity to become what we want to instead of having it dictated to us. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.138 on 2011-07-27 22:24:33 \n         \n     A Republic isn\'t the freest from of government! The freest is total anarchy or total democracy. A republic has representatives to make decision for the people. Even though they are chosen by the people that doesn\'t mean they\'re decisions reflect exactly what every person they represent wants. Anarchy has no rules whatsoever so total freedom, Democracy has everyone vote on every decision so nearly total freedom. Also no one compares Communism and Socialism with a republic because they are not on the same field. A republic is how a government is run. Communism, Capitalism, Fascism are how business is run by in the country (sometimes they r views too). Liberal, Conservative are views(also parties) of how the current government system should make decisions. So for example the US is a mix of Republic and Democracy, with Capitalism, and the two parties. The USSR was totalitarian and Communist. Also Rome and China both call themselves republics, which they were once, but we no that changed. \n     173.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.199 on 2011-05-19 00:15:32 \n         \n     One common trait shared between communism and socialism is the significant absence of freedom of choice among the individuals. I like how some try to focus the comparison of communism and socialism with capitalism rather than making the comparison with a Republic form of government. A Republic is by far offers the most freedom to individuals and the protection of individuals rights. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.150 on 2011-05-15 03:19:56 \n         \n     All of you who rave on the glory of capitalism and how it\'s the only structure that has \'worked\' seem to conveniently FORGET how the free market system virtually brought down the world in 1929 and 2008 (or the next crash that just may be the end of life as you lavishly and richly know it). And you seem to neglect all the greed, crime and corruption due to capitalism. Do you really think that a relatively young system like captialism will succeed forever? There has been no political/economical structure that has stood the test of time - they all fall for one reason or another. Do you really believe the few \'haves\' will continue to rule over the numerous \'have-nots\' because it\'s such a wonderful system? Just wait, it wont be much longer now. But there might be a better way...a blend of the best of all three systems. PS&gt; just the other day I told someone that I think Palin is the antichrist!! \n     71.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.59 on 2011-03-26 07:21:50 \n         \n     A difference between communism and socialism that i\'ve noticed is that communism usually has a dictator (i think this was started by Stalin, i don\'t see Lenin as a dictator) and socialism is intended to be democratic (as Marx wanted, don\'t remember if today\'s socialist countries were or not). With a dictatorship its easier to have more problems by getting a selfish dictator that could be a reason why communism seems to not work. Besides that they both seem about the same to me.\r\n\r\nP.S. Stop calling us Socialist-Nazis! The Nazis weren\'t socialist they were fascist, they were even against all things socialist, communist, and Jewish. The Nazi party just put socialist in their name because the government helped the &quot;master race&quot; and i think to manipulate the people into joining them since socialism was growing at this time period.

Capitalism with some regulation makes sense, this way we do not have to use tax payers money to bail out crooks that manipulate the markets, banks, and trade agreements. So capitalism as it is practiced in a democratic society like the USA, undermines democracy, it favors those in power and keeps the underclass sinking to the bottom. Socialism and Communism could work in theory if humans were more evolved and cared about the things that work for the common good. To get there we need several million years of evolution and a bigger brain to get all members of the society to agree what is good for the common good and decide to practice it with reverence and diligence.\r\nI say good luck! perhaps if aliens showed up and threatened our planet, then we would all have to work for the common good. \n     174.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.247 on 2011-02-13 20:48:57 \n         \n     Socialism is a transition period from capitalism to communism.

That is the way of Humanity. Politics is a twin to religion in that no person agrees with every tenet of their party/group/sect and has their own views as to how things should be, or what is the truth. People thrive on conflict/competition and because of that there is no &quot;system&quot; that will work for everyone, or in every situation, because we all seem to &quot;agree to disagree&quot; about almost all issues. Everyone wants more...most cannot be content just being content and need to feel &quot;better&quot; than someone to feel good about their own situation. Political leaders are usually in it for the power that comes with the office, not to really make a change for the good of the many. NO decision is for the good of everyone, except possibly the &quot;keep the stupid from breeding&quot; thing, but, good luck with that! \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.193 on 2010-09-05 17:47:09 \n         \n     ts people.

But what was it that ultimately prevented the creation of a viable economy? Why was production always of such poor quality, and goods interminably scarce? The USSR certainly had natural resources and an educated workforce. The answer lies in the deincentivization of productivity. When you take away from the productive to give to the unproductive, you punish initiative and reward idleness. The economy stagnates, and a corrupt kleptocracy develops. This is a cautionary tale for the socialists/progressives/liberals of our day. The road to economic hell is paved with the good intentions of those that equate &quot;social justice&quot; with the distribution of private capital (or perhaps even its abolition) rather than its creation.

More on topic, I believe socialism relies on human good will, but our history has shown that greed, selfishness, and self gain serve as greater sources of motivation. Workers rallying and union protests for better wages and equal pay are themselves against socialist ideal because most of them want greater or distributed pay to increase their own benefit or atleast not to see others benefit more than them. Everyone wants something, capitalism works to exploit it for progress. Capitalistic monopolies however can impied on that desire so I agree with regulation to that extent and lack of a heavy &quot;anti-fire&quot; market means we do infact need fire departments. However these public services purchasing from a capital markets is what allows a better fire engine, or a powerful water pump, or lightwieght ladders. \n     24.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.146 on 2010-04-05 18:30:14 \n         \n     &quot;These ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.&quot;...and Nixon, and Reagan, and Bushes, and Greenspan, and Gingrich, and Limbaugh, Beck, Leiberman, Palin, McCain... \n     72.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.130 on 2010-03-30 12:58:15 \n         \n     24.21.84.143 stated the following on 2009-10-12 23:05:18 &quot;I wish Americans would become more educated and less slaves to the false idea that everyone can be rich.

Communism uses force and socialism uses deception because no population will voluntarily accept systems that are designed to enslave everyone with no individual freedoms. They are both a modern fuedal system that allows the &quot;ruling class&quot; to make all decisions and dispose of those they feel are not productive for the whole.\r\nThese ideologies are used in powerplays, much like religion and racism, by those that believe they are more intelligent than everyone and want to feed on the labor of others like Clinton, Pelosi and Reid want.

How does that help you gain &quot;the power?&quot; Which system do you think offers you a better chance? One where an all-powerful government tells you what to do and when and for how long, or you being able to chose your own path through a free-market system. \r\n\r\nYou think that the rich screw the poor in your version of Capitalism, but you fail to realize that the poorest individual in the US is better off than any proletariat(look it up) from any Socialist/communist country you can name. \n     98.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.147 on 2009-11-18 07:23:18 \n         \n     capitalism is worse than both, the rich have all the power, despite what you might think, the poor are fucked over by the rich people, the rich people in power give the other rich people more power and money. in socialism the poor and rich would be equal, the harder working poorer people would have a larger share, the people who in capitalism enherit their wealth would become poor because of their lack of skill and motivation. communism is unfair to all parties. i think i prefer socialism. \n     206.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.253 on 2009-11-11 15:34:34 \n         \n     two things: One, all those &quot;this is bullsh*t&quot; and &quot;this is dumb&quot; people should be taken out and shot, or at least prevented from reproducing.

While it sounds really great in theory to give everybody this and that, not all are going to contribute and not all are going to agree. This is a fact, not a theory.If it were really possible to create a perfect society, whether it be communist, socialist or any other, why have a currency system at all? Afterall, we all agree to help each other. It cannot be done. Utopia would never last just as communism and socialism will never last without genocide to keep from having a revolution.

Not to go on about capitalist rhetoric and more to the point, from what I understand Socialism is characterized by &quot;each according to their ability&quot;, while Communism is characterized by &quot;each according to their need&quot;. Both economic systems, as Socialism and Communism are only economic systems, are theorized to be most effective under two governmental systems: Pure Democracy and Anarchy.

The reason we should care about this is that (and this is in really basic terms) there are some really lazy people out there. If working no longer benefits the individual, and the general population knows that they will be provided for regardless, where is the incentive to strive? If no one ever advances, why do well in your work? Communism frightens me because of potential lack of a central agency to enforce, and thereby protect. Socialism scares me because I think we can all count on one hand the politicians that actually have our best interests at heart. If they controlled everything, who is to say they would do right by the people?

Yes the taxes are high but the costs are low. In Denmark - it is in Europe, we have socialism and we have free schools, the government actually encourage people to get an education by offering free tutoring, and we have free health care. Just because socialism helps people with less money it does not pull others down from succeeding in the global world. United States - who always has favored capitalism, had a debt on $13,050,826,460,886.97 in 2010. When a country keeps lowering taxes to keep the people happy it will increase the debt since spendings keeps going up. The U.S import in 2010 was $497.8 billion which was way higher than the export. \n     216.\xe2\x9c\x97.\xe2\x9c\x97.13 on 2011-03-25 13:04:15 \n     \n     \n      \n        \n     \n    \n     Related Categories Subscribe \n     \n    \n    \n    Philosophy Politics Economics    \n   \n     \n      \n   \n      \n   \n    \n     Recently Compared \n     \n    \n    \n    Certificate of Deposit vs. Money Market Account &raquo;  Chemical Peel vs. Laser Resurfacing &raquo;  GAAP vs. IFRS &raquo;  Hulu vs. Netflix &raquo;  Bottled Water vs. Tap Water &raquo;  Chicago Bulls vs. Miami Heat &raquo;  IMAP vs. POP3 &raquo;  Skim Milk vs. Whole Milk &raquo;  New York Jets vs. Pittsburgh Steelers &raquo;  Triceratops vs. Tyrannosaurus &raquo;    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n     Top 10 Comparisons on Diffen \n     \n    \n    \n    Democrat vs. Republican &raquo;  Animal Cell vs. Plant Cell &raquo;  Meiosis vs. Mitosis &raquo;  Affected vs. Effected &raquo;  Empathy vs. Sympathy &raquo;  Gross vs. Net &raquo;  DNA vs. RNA &raquo;  Full Bed vs. Queen Bed &raquo;  CT Scan vs. MRI &raquo;  Ethnicity vs. Race &raquo;    \n   \n      Tweets by @Diffen \n     \n    \n \n  \n       Log in \n       \n   Comparison Requests \n   Pop Quiz \n   Feedback \n   Blog \n   WordPress plugin \n  \n  Diffen \n  \n   \n    Compare Anything \n    \n    vs. \n    \n    Compare \n    Search for a comparison \n   \n\t \n \n \n  \n   \n    Follow @Diffen \n    \n   \n   \n    RSS \n    Mail \n   \n   \n  \n  \n\n    \n \n  \n  \n   Like this?

In the mid-to-late 19th century, the intellectual development of Marxism was pioneered by two German philosophers : Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels . Marxist analyses and methodologies have influenced multiple political ideologies and social movements throughout history. Marxism encompasses an economic theory , a sociological theory , a philosophical method , and a revolutionary view of social change. [ 1 ] There is no one definitive Marxist theory; Marxist analysis has been applied to a variety of different subjects and has been modified during the course of its development, resulting in multiple and sometimes contradictory theories that fall under the rubric of Marxism or Marxian analysis. [ 2 ] \n Marxism is based on a materialist understanding of societal development, taking as its starting point the necessary economic activities required by human society to provide for its material needs. The form of economic organization, or mode of production , is understood to be the basis from which the majority of other social phenomena&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 including social relations , political and legal systems, morality and ideology&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 arise (or at the least by which they are greatly influenced). These social relations form the superstructure , for which the economic system forms the base. As the forces of production (most notably technology) improve, existing forms of social organization become inefficient and stifle further progress. These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in the form of class struggle . [ 3 ] \n According to Marxist analysis, class conflict within capitalism arises due to intensifying contradictions between highly-productive mechanized and socialized production performed by the proletariat , and private ownership and private appropriation of the surplus product in the form of surplus value (profit) by a small minority of private owners called the bourgeoisie . As the contradiction becomes apparent to the proletariat, social unrest between the two antagonistic classes intensifies, culminating in a social revolution . The eventual long-term outcome of this revolution would be the establishment of socialism - a socioeconomic system based on cooperative ownership of the means of production, distribution based on one\'s contribution , and production organized directly for use . Karl Marx hypothesized that, as the productive forces and technology continued to advance, socialism would eventually give way to a communist stage of social development. Communism would be a classless, stateless, moneyless society based on common ownership and the principle of " From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs ". \n Marxism has developed into different branches and schools of thought. Different schools place a greater emphasis on certain aspects of Classical Marxism while de-emphasizing or rejecting other aspects of Marxism, sometimes combining Marxist analysis with non-Marxian concepts. Some variants of Marxism primarily focus on one aspect of Marxism as the determining force in social development - such as the mode of production, class, power-relationships or property ownership - while arguing other aspects are less important or current research makes them irrelevant. Despite sharing similar premises, different schools of Marxism might reach contradictory conclusions from each other. [ 4 ] For example, different Marxian economists have contradictory explanations of economic crisis and different predictions for the outcome of such crises. Furthermore, different variants of Marxism apply Marxist analysis to study different aspects of society (e.g.: mass culture , economic crises , or Feminism ). [ 5 ] \n These theoretical differences have led various socialist and communist parties and political movements to embrace different political strategies for attaining socialism, advocate different programs and policies. One example of this is the division between revolutionary socialists and reformists that emerged in the German Social Democratic Party during the early 20th century. \n Marxist understandings of history and of society have been adopted by academics in the disciplines of archaeology and anthropology , [ 6 ]  media studies , [ 7 ]  political science , theater , history , sociological theory , art history and art theory , cultural studies , education , economics , geography , literary criticism , aesthetics , critical psychology , and philosophy .

The form of economic organization, or mode of production , is understood to be the basis from which the majority of other social phenomena&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 including social relations, political and legal systems, morality and ideology&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 arise (or at the least by which they are greatly influenced). These social relations form the superstructure , for which the economic system forms the base. As the forces of production , most notably technology , improve, existing forms of social organization become inefficient and stifle further progress. [ citation needed ] \n These inefficiencies manifest themselves as social contradictions in society in the form of class struggle . Under the capitalist mode of production , this struggle materializes between the minority (the bourgeoisie ) who own the means of production , and the vast majority of the population (the proletariat ) who produce goods and services. Taking the idea that social change occurs because of the struggle between different classes within society who are under contradiction against each other, the Marxist analysis leads to the conclusion that capitalism oppresses the proletariat , which leads to a proletarian revolution . \n Capitalism (according to Marxist theory) can no longer sustain the living standards of the population due to its need to compensate for falling rates of profit by driving down wages, cutting social benefits and pursuing military aggression. The socialist system would succeed capitalism as humanity\'s mode of production through workers\' revolution . According to Marxism, especially arising from Crisis theory , Socialism is a historical necessity (but not an inevitability). [ 9 ] \n In a socialist society private property in the means of production would be superseded by co-operative ownership. A socialist economy would not base production on the creation of private profits, but would instead base production and economic activity on the criteria of satisfying human needs \xe2\x80\x94 that is, production would be carried out directly for use . [ citation needed ] \n Concepts \n Historical Materialism \n \n \n \n "The discovery of the materialist conception of history, or rather, the consistent continuation and extension of materialism into the domain of social phenomenon, removed two chief defects of earlier historical theories. In the first place, they at best examined only the ideological motives of the historical activity of human beings, without grasping the objective laws governing the development of the system of social relations... in the second place, the earlier theories did not cover the activities of the masses of the population, whereas historical materialism made it possible for the first time to study with the accuracy of the natural sciences the social conditions of the life of the masses and the changes in these conditions." \n \n \n Russian Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin , 1913. [ 10 ] \n \n \n "Society does not consist of individuals, but expresses the sum of interrelations, the relations within which these individuals stand." \n \xe2\x80\x94&#160; Karl Marx , Grundrisse , 1858 [ 11 ] \n \n The historical materialist theory of history, also synonymous to "the economic interpretation of history" (a coinage by Eduard Bernstein ), [ 12 ] looks for the causes of societal development and change in the collective ways humans use to make the means for living. The social features of a society (social classes, political structures, ideologies) derive from economic activity, an idea often conveyed with the metaphor of the base and superstructure . \n The base and superstructure metaphor explains that the totality of social relations regarding "the social production of their existence" i.e. civil society forms a society\'s economic base , from which rises a superstructure of political and legal institutions, i.e., political society . The base corresponds to the social consciousness (politics, religion, philosophy, etc.), and it conditions the superstructure and the social consciousness. A conflict between the development of material productive forces and the relations of production provokes social revolutions, thus, the resultant changes to the economic base will lead to the transformation of the superstructure. [ 13 ] This relationship is reflexive; the base determines the superstructure, in the first instance, and remains the foundation of a form of social organization which then can act again upon both parts of the base and superstructure, whose relationship is dialectical , not literal. [ citation needed ] [ clarification needed ] \n Marx considered that these socio-economic conflicts have historically manifested themselves as distinct stages (one transitional) of development in Western Europe. [ 14 ] \n \n Primitive Communism : as in co-operative tribal societies. \n Slave Society: a development of tribal progression to city-state; aristocracy is born. \n Feudalism : aristocrats are the ruling class; merchants evolve into capitalists. \n Capitalism : capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the proletariat. \n Socialism : workers gain class consciousness, and via proletarian revolution depose the capitalist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, replacing it in turn with dictatorship of the proletariat through which the socialization of the means of production can be realized. \n Communism : a classless and stateless society. \n \n Criticism of capitalism \n \n "We are, in Marx\'s terms, \'an ensemble of social relations\' and we live our lives at the core of the intersection of a number of unequal social relations based on hierarchically interrelated structures which, together, define the historical specificity of the capitalist modes of production and reproduction and underlay their observable manifestations." \n \xe2\x80\x94Martha E. Gimenez, Marxism and Class, Gender and Race: Rethinking the Trilogy [ 15 ] \n \n According to the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary Vladimir Lenin , "the principal content of Marxism" was "Marx\'s economic doctrine". [ 16 ] Marx believed that the capitalist bourgeois and their economists were promoting what he saw as the lie that "The interests of the capitalist and those of the worker are... one and the same"; he believed that they did this by purporting the concept that "the fastest possible growth of productive capital " was best not only for the wealthy capitalists but also for the workers because it provided them with employment. [ 17 ] \n Exploitation is a matter of surplus labour &#160;\xe2\x80\x94 the amount of labour one performs beyond what one receives in goods. Exploitation has been a socio-economic feature of every class society, and is one of the principal features distinguishing the social classes. The power of one social class to control the means of production enables its exploitation of the other classes. \n In capitalism, the labour theory of value is the operative concern; the value of a commodity equals the socially necessary labour time required to produce it. Under that condition, surplus value (the difference between the value produced and the value received by a labourer) is synonymous with the term "surplus labour"; thus, capitalist exploitation is realised as deriving surplus value from the worker. \n In pre-capitalist economies, exploitation of the worker was achieved via physical coercion. In the capitalist mode of production, that result is more subtly achieved; because the worker does not own the means of production, he or she must voluntarily enter into an exploitive work relationship with a capitalist in order to earn the necessities of life. The worker\'s entry into such employment is voluntary in that he or she chooses which capitalist to work for. However, the worker must work or starve. Thus, exploitation is inevitable, and the "voluntary" nature of a worker participating in a capitalist society is illusory. \n Alienation is the estrangement of people from their humanity ( German: Gattungswesen , "species-essence", "species-being"), which is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others, and so generate alienated labourers. [ 18 ] In Marx\'s view, alienation is an objective characterization of the worker\'s situation in capitalism&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 his or her self-awareness of this condition is not prerequisite. \n The identity of a social class derives from its relationship to the means of production ; Marx describes the social classes in capitalist societies: \n \n Proletariat : "those individuals who sell their labour power , and who, in the capitalist mode of production, do not own the means of production". [ citation needed ] The capitalist mode of production establishes the conditions enabling the bourgeoisie to exploit the proletariat because the workers\xe2\x80\x99 labour generates a surplus value greater than the workers\xe2\x80\x99 wages . \n Bourgeoisie : those who "own the means of production" and buy labour power from the proletariat, thus exploiting the proletariat; they subdivide as bourgeoisie and the petit bourgeoisie.\n \n Petit bourgeoisie are those who employ labourers, but who also work, i.e. small business owners, peasant landlords, trade workers et al. Marxism predicts that the continual reinvention of the means of production eventually would destroy the petit bourgeoisie, degrading them from the middle class to the proletariat. \n \n \n Lumpenproletariat : criminals, vagabonds, beggars, et al., who have no stake in the economy, and so sell their labour to the highest bidder. \n Landlords : an historically important social class who retain some wealth and power. \n Peasantry and farmers : a disorganised class incapable of effecting socio-economic change, most of whom would enter the proletariat, and some become landlords. \n \n Class consciousness denotes the awareness&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 of itself and the social world&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 that a social class possesses, and its capacity to rationally act in their best interests; hence, class consciousness is required before they can effect a successful revolution. \n Without defining ideology , [ 19 ] Marx used the term to denote the production of images of social reality; according to Engels, "ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, it is true, but with a false consciousness. The real motive forces impelling him remain unknown to him; otherwise it simply would not be an ideological process. Hence he imagines false or seeming motive forces". [ 20 ] Because the ruling class controls the society\xe2\x80\x99s means of production, the superstructure of society, the ruling social ideas are determined by the best interests of said ruling class. In The German Ideology , "the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e. the class which is the ruling material force of society, is, at the same time, its ruling intellectual force". [ 21 ] \n The term political economy originally denoted the study of the conditions under which economic production was organised in the capitalist system. In Marxism, political economy studies the means of production, specifically of capital, and how that manifests as economic activity. \n \n \n \n "Marxism taught me what society was. I was like a blindfolded man in a forest, who doesn\'t even know where north or south is. If you don\'t eventually come to truly understand the history of the class struggle , or at least have a clear idea that society is divided between the rich and the poor, and that some people subjugate and exploit other people, you\'re lost in a forest, not knowing anything." \n \n \n Cuban revolutionary and Marxist-Leninist politician Fidel Castro on discovering Marxism, 2009. [ 22 ] \n \n Revolution, socialism, and communism \n Marxists believe that the transition from capitalism to socialism is an inevitable part of the development of human society; as Lenin stated, "it is evident that Marx deduces the inevitability of the transformation of capitalist society [into a socialist society] wholly and exclusively from the economic law of motion of contemporary society." [ 23 ] \n Marxists believe that a socialist society will be far better for the majority of the populace than its capitalist counterpart, for instance, prior to the Russian revolution of 1917, Lenin wrote that "The socialization of production is bound to lead to the conversion of the means of production into the property of society... This conversion will directly result in an immense increase in productivity of labour, a reduction of working hours, and the replacement of the remnants, the ruins of small-scale, primitive, disunited production by collective and improved labour." [ 24 ] \n Classical Marxism \n Main article: Classical Marxism \n The term Classical Marxism denotes the theory propounded by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels . [ citation needed ] As such, Classical Marxism distinguishes between "Marxism" as broadly perceived, and "what Marx believed"; thus, in 1883, Marx wrote to the French labour leader Jules Guesde and to Paul Lafargue (Marx\xe2\x80\x99s son-in-law)&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 both of whom claimed to represent Marxist principles&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 accusing them of "revolutionary phrase-mongering" and of denying the value of reformist struggle; from which derives the paraphrase: "If that is Marxism, then I am not a Marxist". [ 25 ]  [ 26 ] American Marx scholar Hal Draper responded to this comment by saying, "there are few thinkers in modern history whose thought has been so badly misrepresented, by Marxists and anti-Marxists alike". [ 27 ] \n Criticism \n Some Marxists have criticised the academic institutionalisation of Marxism for being too detached from political action. For instance, Zimbabwean Trotskyist Alex Callinicos , himself a professional academic, stated that "Its practitioners remind one of Narcissus , who in the Greek legend fell in love with his own reflection... Sometimes it is necessary to devote time to clarifying and developing the concepts that we use, but indeed for Western Marxists this has become an end in itself. The result is a body of writings incomprehensible to all but a tiny minority of highly qualified scholars." [ 28 ] \n Academic Marxism \n \n \n \n  \nOne of the 20th century\'s most prominent Marxist academics; the Australian archaeologist V. Gordon Childe . \n \n \n Marxism has been adopted by a large number of academics and other scholars working in various disciplines. \n The theoretical development of Marxist archaeology was first developed in the Soviet Union in 1929, when a young archaeologist named Vladislav I. Ravdonikas (1894\xe2\x80\x931976) published a report entitled "For a Soviet history of material culture". Within this work, the very discipline of archaeology as it then stood was criticised as being inherently bourgeoisie and therefore anti-socialist, and so, as a part of the academic reforms instituted in the Soviet Union under the administration of Premier Stalin, a great emphasis was placed on the adoption of Marxist archaeology throughout the country. [ 29 ] These theoretical developments were subsequently adopted by archaeologists working in capitalist states outside of the Leninist bloc, most notably by the Australian academic V. Gordon Childe (1892\xe2\x80\x931957), who used Marxist theory in his understandings of the development of human society.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (October 2010)  \n \n \n Since the late 19th century, Marxist-inspired socialist parties have been internally divided, between proponents of orthodox Marxism and proponents of revisionist Marxism , and between the respective revolutionary and reformist branches. Revolutionary , Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin , said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe supersession of the bourgeois state by the proletarian state is impossible without violent revolution\xe2\x80\x9d. [ 31 ]  Reformist and democratic socialist political theorist Michael Harrington claims that, in their later life, Engels and Marx had advocated the development of socialism through parliamentary means, where-ever possible. [ 32 ] \n Since Marx\'s death in 1883, various groups around the world have appealed to Marxism as the theoretical basis for their politics and policies, which have often proved to be dramatically different and conflicting. [ citation needed ] One of the first major political splits occurred between the advocates of \'reformism\', who argued that the transition to socialism could occur within existing bourgeois parliamentarian frameworks, and communists , who argued that the transition to a socialist society required a revolution and the dissolution of the capitalist state. The \'reformist\' tendency, later known as social democracy , came to be dominant in most of the parties affiliated to the Second International and these parties supported their own governments in the First World War. [ citation needed ] This issue caused the communists to break away, forming their own parties which became members of the Third International . [ citation needed ] \n The following countries had governments at some point in the 20th century who at least nominally adhered to Marxism: [ 33 ]  Albania , Afghanistan , Angola , Benin , Bulgaria , Chile , China , Republic of Congo , Cuba , Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Ethiopia , Grenada , Hungary , Laos , Moldova , Mongolia , Mozambique , Nepal , Nicaragua , North Korea , Poland , Romania , Russia , the USSR and its republics , South Yemen , Yugoslavia , Venezuela , Vietnam . In addition, out of twenty eight Indian states, three state viz. Kerala , Tripura and West Bengal have had Marxist governments, but change occurred through electoral processes. Some of these governments such as in Venezuela , Nicaragua , Chile , Moldova and India have been democratic in nature and maintained regular multiparty elections . \n History \n The 1917 October Revolution , led by Vladimir Lenin , was the first large scale attempt to put Marxist ideas about a workers\' state into practice. The new government faced counter-revolution, civil war and foreign intervention. [ 34 ] Lenin consistently explained "this elementary truth of Marxism, that the victory of socialism requires the joint efforts of workers in a number of advanced countries" (Lenin, Sochineniya (Works), 5th ed Vol XLIV p418.) It could not be developed in Russia in isolation, he argued, but needed to be spread internationally. \n The 1917 October Revolution did help inspire a revolutionary wave over the years that followed, [ 35 ]  [ 36 ]  [ 37 ]  [ 38 ] with the development of Communist Parties worldwide, but without success in the vital advanced capitalist countries of Western Europe. Socialist revolution in Germany and other western countries failed, leaving the Soviet Union on its own. An intense period of debate and stopgap solutions ensued, war communism and the New Economic Policy (NEP). Lenin died and Joseph Stalin gradually assumed control, eliminating rivals and consolidating power as the Soviet Union faced the events of the 1930s and its global crisis-tendencies. Amidst the geopolitical threats which defined the period and included the probability of invasion, he instituted a ruthless program of industrialization which, while successful, [ 39 ] was executed at great cost in human suffering, along with long-term environmental devastation. [ 39 ] \n Modern followers of Leon Trotsky maintain that as predicted by Lenin, Trotsky, and others already in the 1920s, Stalin\'s "socialism in one country" was unable to maintain itself, and according to some Marxist critics, the USSR ceased to show the characteristics of a socialist state long before its formal dissolution. \n In the 1920s the economic calculation debate between Austrian Economists and Marxist economists took place. The Austrians claimed that Marxism is flawed because prices could not be set to recognize opportunity costs of factors of production, and so socialism could not make rational decisions. \n The Kuomintang party, a Chinese nationalist revolutionary party, had Marxist members who opposed the Chinese Communist Party. They viewed the Chinese revolution in different terms than the Communists, claiming that China had already passed its feudal stage and was in a stagnation period rather than in another mode of production. These Marxists in the Kuomintang opposed the Chinese communist party ideology. [ 40 ] \n Following World War II , Marxist ideology, often with Soviet military backing, spawned a rise in revolutionary communist parties all over the world. Some of these parties were eventually able to gain power, and establish their own version of a Marxist state. Such nations included the People\'s Republic of China , Vietnam , Romania , East Germany , Albania , Cambodia , Ethiopia , South Yemen , Yugoslavia , Cuba , and others. In some cases, these nations did not get along. Rifts occurred between the Soviet Union and China, [ 41 ] as well as Soviet Union and Yugoslavia (in 1948), whose leaders disagreed on certain elements of Marxism and how it should be implemented into society. [ 42 ] \n Many of these self-proclaimed Marxist nations (often styled People\'s Republics ) eventually became authoritarian states, with stagnating economies. This caused some debate about whether Marxism was doomed in practise or these nations were in fact not led by "true Marxists". Critics of Marxism speculated that perhaps Marxist ideology itself was to blame for the nations\' various problems. Followers of the currents within Marxism which opposed Stalin, principally cohered around Leon Trotsky , tended to locate the failure at the level of the failure of world revolution : for communism to have succeeded, they argue, it needed to encompass all the international trading relationships that capitalism had previously developed. \n The Chinese experience seems to be unique. Rather than falling under a single family\'s self-serving and dynastic interpretation of Marxism as happened in North Korea and before 1989 in Eastern Europe, the Chinese government&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 after the end of the struggles over the Mao legacy in 1980 and the ascent of Deng Xiaoping&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 seems to have solved the succession crises [ citation needed ] that have plagued self-proclaimed Leninist governments since the death of Lenin himself. Key to this success is another Leninism which is a NEP ( New Economic Policy ) writ very large; Lenin\'s own NEP of the 1920s was the "permission" given to markets including speculation to operate by the Party which retained final control. The Russian experience in Perestroika was that markets under socialism were so opaque as to be both inefficient and corrupt but especially after China\'s application to join the WTO this does not seem to apply universally. \n The death of "Marxism" in China has been prematurely announced but since the Hong Kong handover in 1997, the Beijing leadership has clearly retained final say over both commercial and political affairs. [ citation needed ] \n In 1991 the Soviet Union was dismantled and the new Russian state, alongside the other emerging republics, ceased to identify themselves with Marxism. Other nations around the world followed suit. Since then, radical Marxism or Communism has generally ceased to be a prominent political force in global politics, and has largely been replaced by more moderate versions of democratic socialism\xe2\x80\x94or, more commonly, by neoliberal capitalism. Marxism has also had to engage with the rise in the Environmental movement . Theorists including Joel Kovel and Michael L\xc3\xb6wy have synthesized Marxism, socialism , ecology and environmentalism into an ideology known as Eco-socialism .

Many parties in the second half of the 19th century described themselves as social democratic, such as the British Social Democratic Federation , and the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party . In most cases these were revolutionary socialist or Marxist groups, who were not only seeking to introduce socialism, but also democracy in un-democratic countries. Many social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through class conflict , revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat . \n The modern social democratic current came into being through a break within the socialist movement in the early 20th century, between two groups holding different views on the ideas of Karl Marx . Many related movements, including pacifism , anarchism , and syndicalism , arose at the same time (often by splitting from the main socialist movement, but also through the emergence of new theories) and had various, quite different objections to Marxism. The social democrats argued that socialism should be achieved through evolution rather than revolution. Such views were strongly opposed by the revolutionary socialists, [ 44 ]  [ 45 ] who argued that any attempt to reform capitalism was doomed to fail, because the reformists would be gradually corrupted and eventually turn into capitalists themselves. \n Despite their differences, the reformist and revolutionary branches of socialism remained united until the outbreak of World War I . The war proved to be the final straw that pushed the tensions between them to breaking point. [ citation needed ] The reformist socialists supported their respective national governments in the war, a fact that was seen by the revolutionary socialists as outright treason against the working class (Since [ citation needed ] it betrayed the principle that the workers "have no nation", and the fact that usually the lowest classes are the ones sent into the war to fight, and die, putting the cause at the side). Bitter arguments ensued within socialist parties, as for example between Eduard Bernstein (reformist socialist) and Rosa Luxemburg (revolutionary socialist) within the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Eventually, after the Russian Revolution of 1917 , most of the world\'s socialist parties fractured. The reformist socialists kept the name "Social democrats", while the revolutionary socialists began calling themselves "Communists", and soon formed the modern Communist movement, the Comintern . \n Since the 1920s, doctrinal differences have been constantly growing between social democrats and Communists (who themselves are not unified on the way to achieve socialism), and Social Democracy is mostly used as a specifically Central European label for Labour Parties since then, especially in Germany and the Netherlands and especially since the 1959 Godesberg Program of the German SPD that rejected the praxis of class struggle altogether. \n Socialism \n Main articles: Socialism and Socialism (Marxism) \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Socialism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Development \n \n \n \n History of socialism \n Socialist economics \n Socialist calculation debate \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ideas \n \n \n \n Calculation in kind \n Cooperative \n Common ownership \n Economic democracy \n Economic planning \n Equal opportunity \n Free association \n Labour voucher \n Material balancing \n Peer-to-Peer economy \n Production for use \n Public ownership \n Self-management \n Social dividend \n Socialization \n \n To each according \nto his contribution \n \n Workplace democracy \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Models \n \n \n \n \n Decentralized planning \n Participatory economics \n \n \n Market socialism \n \n \n \n Lange model \n Mutualism \n \n \n \n Economic democracy \n \n \n Planned economy \n Soviet-type \n Project Cybersyn \n \n \n Socialist market economy \n Socialist-oriented market \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Variants \n \n \n \n Agrarian \n Anarchist \n \n \n Democratic \n Ethical \n \n \n Ecological \n Guild \n \n \n Impossibilism \n Liberal \n \n \n Libertarian \n Market \n Marxian \n \n \n One country \n Owenism \n \n \n Reformism \n Religious \n \n \n Revisionism \n Revolutionary \n \n \n Ricardian \n Scientific \n \n \n Social democracy \n State \n \n \n Syndicalism \n Utopian \n \n \n Zionist \n 21st-century \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Charles Hall \n Henri de Saint-Simon \n \n \n Robert Owen \n Charles Fourier \n \n \n William Thompson \n Thomas Hodgskin \n \n \n Louis Blanc \n Moses Hess \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Friedrich Engels \n \n \n Ferdinand Lassalle \n William Morris \n \n \n Mary Harris Jones \n Eugene V.

The Marxist-Leninists sought to work towards a classless, stateless, moneyless society with a Marxist ideology by first creating a socialist state, which represents the proletariat. On the other hand, democratic socialists attempt to work towards an ideal state by social reform and are often little different from social democrats, with the democratic socialists having a more leftist stance. \n The Marxist-Leninist form of government has been in decline since the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Very few countries have governments that describe themselves as socialist in the Marxist sense; as of 2012, only Laos , Vietnam , Nepal , Cuba , and the People\'s Republic of China do so. [ citation needed ] \n On the contrary, electoral parties that describe themselves as socialist or democratic socialist are on the rise, joined together by international organizations such as the Socialist International and the Fourth International . Parties described as socialist are currently dominant in the democracies of the developing world and serve as the ruling party or the main opposition party in most European democracies. Eco-socialism , and Green politics with a strong leftist tinge, are on the rise in European democracies. \n The characterization of a party or government often has little to do with its actual economical and social platform. The government of mainland China , which describes itself as socialist, allows a large private sector to flourish and is socially conservative compared to most Western democracies. A more specific example is universal health-care, which is a trademark issue of many European socialist parties but does not exist in mainland China. Therefore, the historical and cultural aspects of a movement must be taken into context in order for one to arrive at an accurate conclusion of its political ideology from its nominal characterization. \n Communism \n Main article: Communist state \n \n \n Part of the series on \n \n \n Communism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Concepts \n \n \n \n Marxist philosophy \n Marxian economics \n Historical materialism \n Surplus value \n Mode of production \n Class struggle \n Classless society \n Proletarian internationalism \n Workers\' self-management \n World revolution \n People\'s democratic dictatorship \n Collective leadership \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Aspects \n \n \n \n Communist state \n Communist party \n Communist revolution \n Communist symbolism \n Communism and religion \n History of communism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Variants \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n \n Stalinism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Luxemburgism \n \n \n Titoism \n \n \n Juche \n \n \n \n Socialism with Chinese \ncharacteristics \n \n \n \n Castroism \n Guevarism \n \n \n Left \n Council \n Anarchist \n \n \n Religious ( Christian ) \n \n \n Euro \n World \n Stateless \n \n \n National \n Primitive \n Scientific \n \n \n List of communist parties \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Internationals \n \n \n \n Communist League \n \n \n First \n Second \n Third \n Fourth \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Leaders \n \n \n \n &#160;&#160; Gracchus Babeuf \n  &#160;&#160; Karl Marx \n  &#160;&#160; Friedrich Engels \n  &#160;&#160; Peter Kropotkin \n  &#160;&#160; Rosa Luxemburg \n  &#160;&#160; Karl Liebknecht \n  &#160;&#160; Antonio Gramsci \n  &#160;&#160; Vladimir Lenin \n  &#160;&#160; Leon Trotsky \n  &#160;&#160; Joseph Stalin \n  &#160;&#160; Leonid Brezhnev \n  &#160;&#160; Kim Il-Sung \n  &#160;&#160; Mao Zedong \n  &#160;&#160; Deng Xiaoping \n &#160;&#160; Ho Chi Minh \n &#160;&#160; Palmiro Togliatti \n &#160;&#160; Josip Broz Tito \n  &#160;&#160; Fidel Castro \n  &#160;&#160; Che Guevara \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Anti-capitalism \n Anti-communism \n Cold War \n Communitarianism \n Criticisms of communism \n Criticisms of communist party rule \n Dictatorship of the proletariat \n Left-wing politics \n \n \n \n \n New Class \n New Left \n \n \n \n \n Socialism \n Socialist economics \n " Workers of the world, unite!

Due to the dominance of the Communist Party in their governments, these states are often called "communist states" by Western political scientists. However, they have described themselves as "socialist", reserving the term "communism" for a future classless society, [ 46 ] in which the state would no longer be necessary (on this understanding of communism, "communist state" would be an oxymoron )&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 for instance, the USSR was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. \n Communist governments have historically been characterized by state ownership of productive resources in a planned economy and sweeping campaigns of economic restructuring such as nationalization of industry and land reform (often focusing on collective farming or state farms.) While they promote collective ownership of the means of production, Communist governments have been characterized by a strong state apparatus in which decisions are made by the ruling Communist Party.

However, in various contexts, different (and sometimes opposing) political groups have used the term "Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism" to denote the ideologies that they claimed to be upholding. The core ideological features of Marxism-Leninism are those of Marxism and Leninism, that is to say, belief in the necessity of a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism through communist revolution , to be followed by a dictatorship of the proletariat as the first stage of moving towards communism , and the need for a vanguard party to lead the proletariat in this effort. Those who view themselves as Marxist-Leninists, however, vary with regards to the leaders and thinkers that they choose to uphold as progressive (and to what extent). [ citation needed ] \n Leninism holds that capitalism can only be overthrown by revolutionary means; that is, any attempts to reform capitalism from within, such as Social Democracy , Fabianism and non-revolutionary forms of democratic socialism , are doomed to fail due to the inherent contradictions of the capitalist and labour class relations. [ 46 ] The first goal of a Leninist party is to educate the proletariat, so as to remove the various modes of false consciousness the bourgeois have instilled in them, instilled in order to make them more docile and easier to exploit economically, such as religion and nationalism . [ citation needed ] Once the proletariat has gained class consciousness the party will coordinate the proletariat\'s total might to overthrow the bourgeois government, thus the proletariat will seize all political and economic power. Lastly the proletariat (thanks to their education by the party) will implement a dictatorship of the proletariat which would bring upon them the construction and development of socialism, the lower phase of communism. After this, partisan and non-partisan distinction would essentially dissolve as the entire proletariat is elevated to the level of revolutionaries. \n The dictatorship of the proletariat refers to the absolute power of the working class. It is governed by a system of proletarian direct democracy , in which workers hold political power through local councils , known in the Russian Revolution as " soviets ". \n Trotskyism \n Main article: Trotskyism \n Trotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by Leon Trotsky . Trotsky considered himself a Bolshevik - Leninist , arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party . He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism. His politics differed sharply from those of Stalin or Mao , most importantly in declaring the need for an international " permanent revolution ". Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. \n Trotsky advocated proletarian revolution as set out in his theory of " permanent revolution ", and he argued that in countries where the bourgeois - democratic revolution had not triumphed already (in other words, in places that had not yet implemented a capitalist democracy, such as Russia before 1917), it was necessary that the proletariat make it permanent by carrying out the tasks of the social revolution (the "socialist" or "communist" revolution) at the same time, in an uninterrupted process. Trotsky believed that a new socialist state would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless socialist revolutions quickly took hold in other countries as well, especially in the industrial powers with a developed proletariat. \n On the political spectrum of Marxism, Trotskyists are considered to be on the left. They fervently support democracy, oppose political deals with the imperialist powers, and advocate a spreading of the revolution until it becomes global. \n Trotsky developed the theory that the Russian workers\' state had become a " bureaucratically degenerated workers\' state ". Capitalist rule had not been restored, and nationalized industry and economic planning, instituted under Lenin, were still in effect. [ citation needed ] However, the state was controlled by a bureaucratic caste with interests hostile to those of the working class. Trotsky defended the Soviet Union against attack from imperialist powers and against internal counter-revolution , but called for a political revolution within the USSR to restore socialist democracy. He argued that if the working class did not take power away from the Stalinist bureaucracy, the bureaucracy would restore capitalism in order to enrich itself. [ citation needed ] In the view of many Trotskyists, this is exactly what has happened since the beginning of Glasnost and Perestroika in the USSR. Some [ who? ] argue that the adoption of market socialism by the People\'s Republic of China has also led to capitalist counter-revolution. [ citation needed ] Most modern Trotskyist organisations are organised internationally, such as the International Marxist Tendency , International Socialist Tendency and the Committee for a Workers\' International . They are mostly rather small groupings. \n Maoism \n Main article: Maoism \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Maoism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Basic concepts \n \n \n \n Marxism-Leninism \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n Three Worlds Theory \n Social-imperialism \n Mass line \n People\'s war \n Cultural Revolution \n New Democracy \n Agrarian socialism \n People\'s democratic dictatorship \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Prominent Maoists \n \n Mao Zedong \n \n Chen Boda \n Abimael Guzm\xc3\xa1n \n \xc4\xb0brahim Kaypakkaya \n Lin Biao \n Charu Majumdar \n Siraj Sikder \n Pierre Mulele \n Huey P.

Likewise, Maoist groups [ which? ] outside China have usually called themselves Marxist-Leninist rather than Maoist, a reflection of Mao\'s view that he did not change, but only developed, Marxism-Leninism. However, some [ who? ] Maoist groups believing Mao\'s theories to have been sufficiently substantial additions to the basics of the Marxist canon , call themselves "Marxist-Leninist-Maoist" (MLM) or simply "Maoist". \n In the People\'s Republic of China, Mao Zedong Thought is part of the official doctrine of the Communist Party of China, but since the 1978 beginning of Deng Xiaoping \'s market economy -oriented reforms, the concept of " socialism with Chinese characteristics " has come to the forefront of Chinese politics, Chinese economic reform has taken hold, and the official definition and role of Mao\'s original ideology in the PRC has been radically altered and reduced (see History of China ). \n Unlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban proletariat was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao believed that peasantry could be the main force behind a revolution, led by the proletariat and a vanguard Communist party. The model for this was of course the Chinese communist rural Protracted People\'s War of the 1920s and 1930s, which eventually brought the Communist Party of China to power. [ citation needed ] Furthermore, unlike other forms of Marxism-Leninism in which large-scale industrial development was seen as a positive force, Maoism made all-round rural development the priority. [ citation needed ] \n Mao felt that this strategy made sense during the early stages of socialism in a country in which most of the people were peasants. Unlike most other political ideologies, including other socialist and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral military doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with military strategy . In Maoist thought, "political power grows from the barrel of the gun" (a famous quote by Mao), and the peasantry can be mobilized to undertake a " people\'s war " of armed struggle involving guerrilla warfare in three stages. \n Left communism \n Main article: Left communism \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Left communism \n \n \n \n \n Concepts \n \n \n \n Anti-Leninism \n \n \n Revolutionary spontaneity \n \n \n Proletarian internationalism \n \n \n Class consciousness \n \n \n Class struggle \n \n \n Mass strike \n Workers\' council \n \n \n World revolution \n Communism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Friedrich Engels \n \n \n Daniel De Leon \n \n \n Rosa Luxemburg \n Otto R\xc3\xbchle \n \n \n Amadeo Bordiga \n Onorato Damen \n \n \n Herman Gorter \n \n \n Antonie Pannekoek \n \n \n Sylvia Pankhurst \n \n \n Gavril Myasnikov \n Paul Mattick \n \n \n Grandizo Munis \n \n \n Jan Appel \n Karl Liebknecht \n \n \n Karl Schr\xc3\xb6der \n \n \n Marc Chirik (Marc Laverne) \n \n \n Guy Debord \n E.

Discussion of this nomination can be found on the talk page . (May 2011)  \n \n \n Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the Communist Left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first two Congresses. \n Two major traditions can be observed within Left communism: the Dutch - German tradition; and the Italian tradition. The political positions those traditions have in common are a shared opposition to what is termed frontism , nationalism , all kinds of national liberation movements and parliamentarianism and there is an underlying commonality at a level of abstract theory. Crucially, Left Communist groups from both traditions tend to identify elements of commonality in each other. [ vague ] \n The historical origins of Left Communism can be traced to the period before the First World War , but it only came into focus after 1918 . All [ according to whom? ] Left Communists were supportive of the October Revolution in Russia , [ citation needed ] but retained a critical view of its development. Some [ which? ] , however, would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a proletarian or socialist nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the bourgeois revolution by creating a state capitalist system. [ citation needed ] \n Left Communism first came into being as a clear movement in or around 1918. [ citation needed ] Its essential features were: a stress on the need to build a Communist Party entirely separate from the reformist and centrist elements who were seen as having betrayed socialism in 1914, opposition to all but the most restricted participation in elections , and an emphasis on the need for revolutionaries to move on the offensive. [ citation needed ] Apart from that, there was little in common between the various wings. Only the Italians [ original research? ] accepted the need for electoral work at all for a very short period of time, and the German-Dutch, Italian and Russian wings opposed the "right of nations to self-determination", which they denounced as a form of bourgeois nationalism . \n Dispute that the Soviet Union was Marxist \n Marx defined "communism" as a classless, egalitarian and stateless society. To Marx, the notion of a communist state would have seemed an oxymoron, [ 47 ]  [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] as he defined communism as the phase reached when class society and the state had already been abolished. Once the lower stage towards communism, commonly referred to as socialism, had been established, society would develop new social relations over the course of several generations, reaching what Marx called the higher phase of communism when not only bourgeois relations but every class social relations had been abandoned. Such a development has yet to occur in any historical self-claimed socialist state. [ 47 ]  [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] \n Even within the Stalinist state at its height, there were repressed [ 47 ] expressions of Marxist orthodoxy, revealed after the fall of the USSR, arguing that it had developed new class structures: those who are in government and therefore have power (sometimes referred to as the political class ), and those who are not in government and do not have power, the working class. This is taken to be a different form of capitalism, in which the government, as owner of the means of production, takes on the role formerly played by the capitalist class; this arrangement is referred to as " state capitalism ." [ 47 ] These statist regimes have generally followed a planned economy model without making a transition to this hypothetical final stage. [ 50 ] \n Some academics such as Noam Chomsky disputed the claim that the political movements in the former Soviet Union were Marxist. [ 50 ] Communist governments have historically been characterized by state ownership of productive resources in a planned economy and sweeping campaigns of economic restructuring such as nationalization of industry and land reform (often focusing on collective farming or state farms). While they promote collective ownership of the means of production, Communist governments have been characterized by a strong state apparatus in which decisions are made by the ruling Communist Party. Dissident communists have characterized the Soviet model as state socialism or state capitalism . \n Variants \n Marxists can interpret the Manifesto differently, and therefore all variants cannot be covered in this article. \n Marxism-Leninism \n Main article: Marxism-Leninism \n At least in terms of adherents and the impact on the world stage, Marxism-Leninism, also known colloquially as Bolshevism or simply communism is the biggest trend within Marxism, easily dwarfing all of the other schools of thought combined. [ 51 ] Marxism-Leninism is a term originally coined by the CPSU in order to denote the ideology that Vladimir Lenin had built upon the thought of Karl Marx . There are two broad areas that have set apart Marxism-Leninism as a school of thought. \n First, Lenin\'s followers generally view his additions to the body of Marxism as the practical corollary to Marx\'s original theoretical contributions of the 19th century; insofar as they apply under the conditions of advanced capitalism that they found themselves working in. Lenin called this time-frame the era of Imperialism . For example, Joseph Stalin wrote that \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n Leninism grew up and took shape under the conditions of imperialism, when the contradictions of capitalism had reached an extreme point, when the proletarian revolution had become an immediate practical question, when the old period of preparation of the working class for revolution had arrived at and passed into a new period, that of direct assault on capitalism. [ 52 ] \n \xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n The most important consequence of a Leninist-style theory of Imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries\' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat, as is traditional to Marxism, are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite! [ 53 ] \n \xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n Second, the other distinguishing characteristic of Marxism-Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the Social Democratic parties of the time, which was a loose, multitendency organization was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of Democratic Centralism . \n Marxism-Leninism after Stalin \n For better or worse, Marxism-Leninism as a body of thought and practice was closely identified with the figure of Joseph Stalin after the death of Lenin. After the death of Stalin, the leader of the USSR, Nikita Khrushchev made several ideological and practical ruptures with his predecessor which lead to the eventual split of Marxism-Leninism into two main branches, post-Stalin "Moscow-aligned" communism and anti-revisionism . In turn, these branches evolved into multiple schools of thought over time. \n Post-Stalin Moscow-aligned communism \n At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , Khrushchev made several ideological ruptures with his predecessor, Joseph Stalin. First, Khrushchev denounced the so-called Cult of Personality that had developed around Stalin, which ironically enough Khrushchev had had a pivotal role in fostering decades earlier. More importantly, however, Khrushchev rejected the heretofore orthodox Marxist-Leninist tenet that class struggle continues even under socialism. Rather, the State ought to rule in the name of all classes. A related principle that flowed from the former was the notion of peaceful co-existence , or that the newly emergent socialist bloc could peacefully compete with the capitalist world, solely by developing the productive forces of society. \n Eurocommunism \n Beginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe, such as the Partito Comunista Italiano in Italy and the Partido Comunista de Espa\xc3\xb1a under Santiago Carillo tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci , despite the fact that by 1921 Gramsci believed that a Communist Party in the Leninist sense was needed. This trend went by the name Eurocommunism . \n Anti-revisionism \n There are many proponents of Marxist-Leninism who rejected the theses of Khrushchev. They believed that Khrushchev was unacceptably altering or "revising" the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism, a stance from which the label "anti-revisionist" is derived. Usually, they are referred to externally by the following epithets, although anti-revisionists typically refer to themselves simply as Marxist-Leninists. \n Maoism \n Maoism takes its name from Mao Zedong , the erstwhile leader of the Peoples Republic of China ; it is the variety of anti-revisionism that took inspiration, and in some cases received material support, from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the dictatorship of the proletariat , it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the proletariat at the expense of the disenfranchised bourgeoisie. Second, Mao developed a strategy for revolution called Prolonged People\'s War in what he termed the semi-feudal countries of the Third World. Prolonged People\'s War relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics, which he called contradictions . \n Hoxhaism \n Hoxhaism , so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman Enver Hoxha , was closely aligned with the People\'s Republic of China for a number of years, but grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called Three Worlds Theory put forth by elements within the Communist Party of China and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping unfavorably. Ultimately, however, Hoxhaism as a trend came to the understanding that Socialism had never existed in China at all. \n Trotskyism \n Main article: Trotskyism \n Trotskyism is the usual term for followers of the ideas of Russian Marxist Leon Trotsky , the second most prominent leader of the Russian Revolution . Trotsky was a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party , where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin\'s Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks ; nevertheless Trotsky\'s followers claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist-Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought; foremost is the theory of Permanent Revolution . Another shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union; that is to say, after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the CPSU [ 54 ] and subsequently from the Soviet Union. Trotsky characterized the government of the USSR after his expulsion as being dominated by a "bureaucratic caste" and called for it to be overthrown. [ 55 ] \n Left Communism \n Main article: Left Communism \n Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first two congresses. \n Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, Rosa Luxemburg has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Herman Gorter , Anton Pannekoek , Otto R\xc3\xbchle , Karl Korsch , Amadeo Bordiga , and Paul Mattick . \n Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Current and the International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party. Also, different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are considered left communist organizations. \n Western Marxism \n Main article: Western Marxism \n Western Marxism includes a wide variety of Marxist theoreticians based in Western and Central Europe (and more recently North America ), in contrast with philosophy in the Soviet Union , the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the People\'s Republic of China . \n Structural Marxism \n Main article: Structural Marxism \n Structural Marxism is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism , primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students.In Althusser\'s theory, the structural order of the capitalist mode of production is distinct both from the actual, real agents involved in its relations and from the ideological forms in which those relations are understood. Structural Marxism was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside of France during the 1970s. \n Autonomist Marxism \n Main article: Autonomism \n Autonomism is a term applied to a variety of social movements around the world, which emphasizes the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties. Autonomist Marxists, including Harry Cleaver , broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework; it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation, and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a 21st century Empire . \n Marxist humanism \n Main article: Marxist humanism \n Marxist humanism is a branch of Marxism that primarily focuses on Marx\'s earlier writings , especially the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 in which Marx develops his theory of alienation , as opposed to his later works, which are considered to be concerned more with his structural conception of capitalist society . It was opposed by Louis Althusser \'s " antihumanism ", who qualified it as a revisionist movement. \n Marxist humanists contend that \xe2\x80\x98Marxism\xe2\x80\x99 developed lopsidedly because Marx\xe2\x80\x99s early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 the Manuscripts of 1844 were published only in 1932&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 and it is necessary to understand Marx\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical foundations to understand his latter works properly. \n Marxism-De Leonism \n Marxism-De Leonism, is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by Daniel De Leon . De Leon was an early leader of the first US socialist political party, the Socialist Labor Party. This party exists to the present day. De Leonism lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism-Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. Daniel De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against \'democratic socialist\' movements, especially the Socialist Party of America, and consider them to be "reformist" or "bourgeois socialist". De Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon\'s time was active during strikes and such, such as social justice movements. [ citation needed ] \n Marxist feminism \n Main article: Marxist feminism \n Marxist feminism is a sub-type of feminist theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that private property, which gives rise to economic inequality, dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women\'s oppression. According to Marxist theory , in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations; that is, people\'s capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see gender inequality as determined ultimately by the capitalist mode of production. Gender oppression is class oppression and women\'s subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like racism ) because it serves the interests of capital and the ruling class . Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at domestic labour as well as wage work in order to support their position. [ citation needed ] \n Etymology \n The term "Marxism" was popularized by Karl Kautsky who considered himself an "orthodox" Marxist during the dispute between the orthodox and revisionist followers of Marx. [ 56 ] Kautsky\'s revisionist rival Eduard Bernstein also later adopted use of the term. [ 56 ] Engels did not support the use of the term "Marxism" to describe either Marx\'s or his views. [ 57 ] Engels claimed that the term was being abusively used as a rhetorical qualifier by those attempting to cast themselves as "real" followers of Marx while casting others in different terms, such as "Lassallians". [ 57 ] In 1882, Engels claimed that Marx had had criticized self-proclaimed "Marxist" Paul Lafargue , by saying that if Lafargue\'s views were considered "Marxist", then "One thing is certain and that is that I am not a Marxist". [ 57 ] \n History \n Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels \n Main articles: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels \n Karl Heinrich Marx (5 May 1818&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher , political economist , and socialist revolutionary , who addressed the matters of alienation and exploitation of the working class, the capitalist mode of production , and historical materialism . He is famous for analysing history in terms of class struggle , summarised in the initial line introducing the Communist Manifesto (1848): "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". His ideas were influential in his time, and it was greatly expanded by the successful Bolshevik October Revolution of 1917 in Imperial Russia . \n Friedrich Engels (28 November 1820&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 5 August 1895) was a German political philosopher and Karl Marx\xe2\x80\x99s co-developer of communist theory. Marx and Engels met in September 1844; discovering that they shared like views of philosophy and socialism , they collaborated and wrote works such as Die heilige Familie ( The Holy Family ). After the French deported Marx from France in January 1845, Engels and Marx moved to Belgium, which then permitted greater freedom of expression than other European countries; later, in January 1846, they returned to Brussels to establish the Communist Correspondence Committee. \n In 1847, they began writing The Communist Manifesto (1848), based upon Engels\xe2\x80\x99 The Principles of Communism ; six weeks later, they published the 12,000-word pamphlet in February 1848. In March, Belgium expelled them, and they moved to Cologne , where they published the Neue Rheinische Zeitung , a politically radical newspaper. Again, by 1849, they had to leave Cologne for London. The Prussian authorities pressured the British government to expel Marx and Engels, but Prime Minister Lord John Russell refused. \n After Karl Marx\xe2\x80\x99s death in 1883, Friedrich Engels became the editor and translator of Marx\'s writings. With his Origins of the Family, Private Property, and the State (1884)&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 analysing monogamous marriage as guaranteeing male social domination of women, a concept analogous, in communist theory, to the capitalist class\xe2\x80\x99s economic domination of the working class&#160;\xe2\x80\x94 Engels made intellectually significant contributions to feminist theory and Marxist feminism . \n Late 20th century \n Political Marxism \n In 1959, the Cuban Revolution led to the victory of anti-imperialist Fidel Castro (1926\xe2\x80\x93) and his July 26 Movement . Although the revolution had not been explicitly socialist, upon victory Castro ascended to the position of Prime Minister and eventually adopted the Leninist model of socialist development, forging an alliance with the Soviet Union. [ 58 ] One of the leaders of the revolution, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928\xe2\x80\x931967), subsequently went on to aid revolutionary socialist movements in Congo-Kinshasa and Bolivia, eventually being killed by the Bolivian government, possibly on the orders of the CIA, though the CIA agent sent to search for Guevara, Felix Rodriguez expressed a desire to keep him alive as a possible bargaining tool with the Cuban government; he would posthumously go on to become an internationally recognised icon. \n In the People\'s Republic of China, the Maoist government undertook the Cultural Revolution from 1966 through to 1976 in order to purge capitalist elements from Chinese society and entrench socialism. However, upon Mao\'s death, his rivals seized political power and under the Premiership of Deng Xiaoping (1978\xe2\x80\x931992), many of Mao\'s Cultural Revolution era policies were revised or abandoned and much of the state sector privatised. \n The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of most of those socialist states that had professed a Marxist-Leninist ideology. In the late 1970s and 1980s, the emergence of the New Right and neoliberal capitalism as the dominant ideological trends in western politics \xe2\x80\x94 championed by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher \xe2\x80\x94 led the west to take a more aggressive stand against the Soviet Union and its Leninist allies. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, the reformist Mikhael Gorbachev (1931\xe2\x80\x93) became Premier in 1988, and began to move away from Leninist-based models of development towards social democracy . Ultimately, Gorbachev\'s reforms, coupled with rising levels of popular ethnic nationalism in the Soviet Union, led to the state\'s dissolution in 1991 into a series of constituent nations, all of which abandoned Marxist-Leninist models for socialism, with most converting to capitalist economies. \n 21st century \n Political Marxism \n At the turn of the 21st century, Cuba remained the only officially Marxist-Leninist state, although a Maoist government led by Prachanda (1954\xe2\x80\x93) was elected into power in Nepal in 2008 following a long guerrilla struggle. The early 21st century also saw the election of socialist and anti-imperialist governments in several Latin American nations, in what has come to be known as the " Pink tide ". Dominated by the Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez , this trend also saw the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua; forging political and economic alliances through international organisations like the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas , these socialist governments allied themselves with Marxist-Leninist Cuba, and although none of them espoused a Leninist path directly, most admitted to being significantly influenced by Marxist theory. For Italian Marxist Gianni Vattimo in his 2011 book Hermeneutic Communism "this new weak communism differs substantially from its previous Soviet (and current Chinese) realization, because the South American countries follow democratic electoral procedures and also manage to decentralize the state bureaucratic system through the misiones (social missions for community projects) . In sum, if weakened communism is felt as a specter in the West, it is not only because of media distortions but also for the alternative it represents through the same democratic procedures that the West constantly professes to cherish but is hesitant to apply" [ 59 ] \n Criticisms \n Main article: Criticisms of Marxism \n Criticisms of Marxism have come from various political ideologies. Democratic socialists and social democrats reject the idea that socialism can be accomplished only through class conflict and a proletarian revolution . Many anarchists reject the need for a transitory state phase . Other critiques come from an economic standpoint. Economists such as Friedrich Hayek have criticized Marxism for allocating resources inefficiently. \n Some contemporary supporters of Marxism argue that many aspects of Marxist thought are viable, but that the corpus is incomplete or outdated in regards to certain aspects of economic, political or social theory . They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as Max Weber : the Frankfurt school is one example. \n V. K. Dmitriev, writing in 1898, [ 60 ]  Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz , writing in 1906-07, [ 61 ] and subsequent critics have alleged that Marx\'s value theory and law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall are internally inconsistent. In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once these alleged errors are corrected, his conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by, and equal to, aggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit. [ 62 ] \n Both Marxism and socialism have received considerable critical analysis from multiple generations of Austrian economists in terms of scientific methodology, economic theory, and political implications. [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] During the marginal revolution , subjective value theory was rediscovered by Carl Menger , a development which undermined the British cost theories of value fundamentally. The restoration of subjectivism and praxeological methodology previously employed by classical economic scientists including Richard Cantillon , Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot , Jean-Baptiste Say , and Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Bastiat led Menger to criticise historicist methodology in general. Second-generation Austrian economist Eugen B\xc3\xb6hm von Bawerk employed praxeological and subjectivist methodology attacking the law of value fundamentally. Non-Marxist economists have regarded his criticism as definitive with Gottfried Haberler arguing that B\xc3\xb6hm-Bawerk\'s critique of Marx\'s economics was so thorough and devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it. [ 65 ] Third-generation Austrian Ludwig Von Mises sparked the economic calculation debate by identifying that without price signals in capital goods all other aspects of the market economy are irrational. This led him to declare "...that rational economic activity is impossible in a socialist commonwealth ." [ 66 ] Mises then elaborated on every form of socialism more completely in his 1922 book Socialism, an Economic and Sociological Analysis . Contemporary Austrian critics include Murray Rothbard , David Gordon Yuri Maltsev , Gary North , and Joseph Salerno . \n See also \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Analytical Marxism \n Anarchism and Marxism \n Austromarxism \n Classical Marxism \n Commodity (Marxism) \n Cultural Marxism \n Democracy in Marxism \n Freudo-Marxism \n Instrumental Marxism \n International Marxist Tendency \n International Socialist Tendency \n Karl Marx \n Karl Marx House \n Karl Marx in film \n Karl Marx\'s Theory of History \n Legal Marxism \n Libertarian Marxism \n Living Marxism \n Marxian Class Theory \n Marxian economics \n Marxism and Freedom \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Marxism and the U.S.A. \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n Marxism Today \n Marxist aesthetics \n Marxist analysis \n Marxist conception of human nature \n Marxist criminology \n Marxist feminism \n Marxist film theory \n Marxist geography \n Marxist historiography \n Marxist humanism \n Marxist international relations theory \n Marxist literary criticism \n Marxist philosophy \n Marxist philosophy of nature \n Marxist sociology \n Marxist Workers\' League (US) \n Marxists Internet Archive \n Marx Memorial Library \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Marx\xe2\x80\x99s method \n Marx\'s notebooks on technology \n Marx\'s theory of alienation \n Marx\'s theory of human nature \n Neo-Marxism \n Open Marxism \n Orthodox Marxism \n Political Marxism \n Post-Marxism \n Pre-Marx socialists \n Reification (Marxism) \n Rethinking Marxism \n Revisionism (Marxism) \n Revolutionary Marxist League \n Socialism (Marxism) \n Specters of Marx \n Structural Marxism \n The Marxism of Che Guevara \n Western Marxism \n Young Marx \n \n \n \n \n \n \n References \n Footnotes \n \n \n ^  social science&#160;: Marxist influences - Britannica Online Encyclopedia \n ^  Wolff and Resnick, Richard and Stephen (August 1987).

Child workers had small hands that could reach in to the machinery to change bobbins or do repairs, but many children were maimed or killed by the whirring machines. \n\t\t\t FPG / Hulton Archive / Getty Images \n\t\t\n  \n  \n  \n   \n\t\t\t More Images (2) \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n  \n \n\n Question: What Is the Difference between Communism and Socialism? Answer: Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and communism and socialism are related concepts, the two systems are different in crucial ways. However, both communism and socialism arose in response to the Industrial Revolution , during which capitalist factory owners grew extremely wealthy by exploiting their workers. Early in the industrial period, workers toiled under horrendously difficult and unsafe conditions. They might work 12 or 14 hours per day, six days per week, without meal breaks. Workers included children as young as 6, who were valued because their small hands and nimble fingers could get inside the machinery to repair it or clear blockages. The factories often were poorly lit and had no ventilation systems, and dangerous or poorly-designed machinery all too frequently maimed or killed the workers. \n Basic Theory of Communism In reaction to these horrible conditions within capitalism, German theorists Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) created the alternative economic and political system called communism . In their books, The Condition of the Working Class in England , The Communist Manifesto , and Das Kapital , Marx and Engels decried the abuse of workers in the capitalist system, and laid out a utopian alternative. Under communism, none of the "means of production" - factories, land, etc. - are owned by individuals. Instead, the government controls the means of production, and all of the people work together. The wealth produced is shared out among the people based on their needs, rather than on their contribution to the work. The result, in theory, is a classless society where everything is public, rather than private, property. In order to achieve this communist workers\' paradise, the capitalist system must be destroyed through violent revolution. Marx and Engels believed that industrial workers (the "proletariat") would rise up around the world and overthrow the middle class (the "bourgeoisie"). Once the communist system was established, even government would cease to be necessary, as everyone toiled together for the common good. Socialism The theory of socialism , while similar in many ways to communism, is less extreme and more flexible. For example, although government control of the means of production is one possible solution, socialism also allows for workers\' cooperative groups to control a factory or farm together. Rather than crushing capitalism and overthrowing the bourgeoisie, socialist theory allows for the more gradual reform of capitalism through legal and political processes, such as the election of socialists to national office. Also unlike communism, in which the proceeds are divided based on need, under socialism the proceeds are divided based on each individual\'s contribution to society. Thus, while communism requires the violent overthrow of the established political order, socialism can work within the political structure. In addition, where communism demands central control over the means of production (at least in the initial stages), socialism allows for more free enterprise among workers\' cooperatives. Communism and Socialism in Action Both communism and socialism were designed to improve the lives of ordinary people, and to more equitably distribute wealth. In theory, either system should have been able to provide for the working masses. In practice, however, the two had very different outcomes. Because communism provides no incentive for people to work - after all, the central planners will simply take your products, then redistribute them equally regardless of how much effort you expend - it tended to lead to impoverishment and immiseration. Workers quickly realized that they would not benefit from working harder, so most gave up. Socialism, in contrast, does reward hard work. After all, each worker\'s share of the profit depends upon her or his contribution to society. Countries that implemented one or another version of communism in the 20th century include Russia (as the Soviet Union), China , Vietnam , Cambodia , Cuba, and North Korea . In every case, communist dictators rose to power in order to enforce the reordering of the political and economic structure. Today, Russia and Cambodia are no longer communist, China and Vietnam are politically communist but economically capitalist, and Cuba and North Korea continue to practice communism. Countries with socialist policies, in combination with a capitalist economy and democratic political system, include Sweden, Norway, France, Canada, India and the United Kingdom. In each of these cases, socialism has achieved the moderation of capitalistic drives for profit at any human expense, without disincentivizing work or brutalizing the populace. Socialist policies provide for worker benefits such as vacation time, universal health care, subsidized child-care, etc. without demanding central control of industry. In short, the practical difference between communism and socialism can be summed up this way: Would you prefer to live in Norway, or in North Korea? \n \n\n\n \n\t\t\n\t \n\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\n More about Communism in Asia Mao Zedong Biography Vietnam | Facts and History What was the Khmer Rouge?

Young \n Once its biggest self-celebration, May Day now signals Mayday for global communism. Just a half century ago, it seemed irrepressible, now communism is just reprehensible, with the relevance of a renaissance festival. Ironically, it is the Left who most want to forget\xe2\x80\xa6 before the lesson behind communism\xe2\x80\x99s demise can be more broadly applied. \n In the 1960s, the whole world seemed to be going communist. It held half of Europe, much of Africa, almost all of Asia, and seemingly the entire world\xe2\x80\x99s intelligentsia. Only \xe2\x80\x9cbenighted\xe2\x80\x9d pockets held out. Fifty years later, the situation has reversed \xe2\x80\x93 now communism is closeted away. \n Save for a crackpot dictator in North Korea and a mid-twentieth century relic in Cuba, there are few places unabashedly embracing its doctrines. While it still holds nominal title to the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest country, it does so only in blatant self-contradiction. China\xe2\x80\x99s communist rulers have held onto the government, but only by letting go of the economy. And where communism and capitalism exist side-by-side, there is no longer a question which will win. \n Where once world domination was its avowed goal, now isolation from the world is its only hope. Cuba is literally an island and North Korea a figurative one. Where once it grabbed headlines from illusory accomplishments, it now takes a petty tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s saber-rattling tantrums to garner attention. \n For communists, it was not supposed to be thus. Communism imagined and sold itself as the apogee of economic development. In Khrushchev\xe2\x80\x99s words, they were going to \xe2\x80\x9cbury\xe2\x80\x9d us. According to Marx\xe2\x80\x99s theory, communism was supposed to arise from capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s insurmountable contradictions and be their inevitable resolution \xe2\x80\x93 the highest and final state of economic development. \n Yet the reverse of Marxist theory has played out in world history. Communism, where it has been installed, has been in the least developed nations \xe2\x80\x93 seized upon in mistaken hope that it would yield the growth they lacked. Instead, it only retarded what little they had. \n Far from resolving conflicts, it owes its existence to them. It has never been peacefully embraced, but always imposed. Communists have adapted their theories to justify this as the necessity of stamping out capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s vestiges. Yet oppression has never gone away \xe2\x80\x93 even after claiming capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s demise. \n Oppression never left because it never could \xe2\x80\x93 precisely because communism seeks to enforce an inefficient economic model. It can only survive by suppressing the contradiction. It survives only as long as its suppression continues and its inherited resources hold out. The quintessential caricature of the corrupt capitalist \xe2\x80\x93 the lazy scion of inherited wealth, dissipated in undeserved opulence \xe2\x80\x93 is actually the real picture of the communist state. \n If it is fortunate enough to rule over resources, it uses (and abuses) them, for a time, to sustain itself. But when these are gone, and they always are alarmingly quickly, communism crashes with them. \n The reason is simple: Communism cannot create wealth in a sustainable manner. While capitalism invigorates, communism enervates. This is why it not only cannot have capitalism within it \xe2\x80\x93 because the contrast is too great and too obvious \xe2\x80\x93 but even contiguous to it. In both cases, communism\xe2\x80\x99s victims will seek to escape from it. Within communism, they will patronize the pockets of capitalism. Outside its borders, they will run to it. \n It is noteworthy and telling that never in numbers have people sought to escape capitalism for communism. The misguided few who have, almost invariably soon sought to leave. Those who stayed found themselves literally trapped or effectively so \xe2\x80\x93 by being such pariahs in the broader world that they had nowhere else to go. \n Today, not satisfied with having destroyed its avowed enemy, capitalism continues to outflank those who believe they can harness it for statist purposes. The welfare states, which thought they could take possession of increasing amounts of capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s generated wealth and redistribute it more effectively and efficiently, now find themselves on the road to bankruptcy. \n Once again, if not trapped, capital and capitalist alike flee, now having an entire world in which to seek refuge. \n These lessons now are so apparent as to be inarguable. For this reason, today\xe2\x80\x99s Left would prefer the topic dropped entirely. The Left, who once embraced, would like it to be relegated to history as soon and as quietly as possible. They would because they want the broader implications of capitalism\xe2\x80\x99s victory to be equally unseen. \n Mankind\xe2\x80\x99s laws are subject to the state that enforces them. The laws of economics are not \xe2\x80\x93 any more than are the laws of gravity. Newton could equally well have sought to affix his fallen apple to the tree. Only with progressively greater effort can the laws of gravity or economics be prevented from exerting themselves. Even when successful, the laws are not overcome, just denied \xe2\x80\x93 the negation is only temporary and the defeat, inevitable. \n But even 25 years ago, the Left still were debating and imagining they were winning \xe2\x80\x93 long after communism\xe2\x80\x99s citizens knew the truth, the West\xe2\x80\x99s intellectuals did not. With them and communism\xe2\x80\x99s rotten remnants, Reagan and Thatcher debated. And more importantly, stood firm. \n They did so because they knew they were right. To both, the question was not if they would win, but when. Unquestionably they accelerated communism\xe2\x80\x99s downfall \xe2\x80\x93 mercifully shortening the misery of millions. However, they did not cause it. Communism itself, and capitalism, caused it. Reagan and Thatcher would say no less. \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n    \n    Page\n     \n\n       1 \n\t\t\t\t\t 2 \n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n      \xc2\xab Previous Page \n      \n      Next Page \xc2\xbb\n      \n\n    \n  \n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n  \n   \n   \n   \n    \n\n    \n     \n     11 comments, 0 called-out\n     \n    \n     Comment Now \n\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Follow Comments \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Following Comments \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Unfollow Comments \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n  \n  \n\t\t\t \n   \n   \n   \n    Comment Now \n\t\t\t \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Follow Comments \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Following Comments \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t Unfollow Comments \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n  \n  \n\t\t\t \n  \n  \n\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Print \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Report Corrections \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Reprints &amp; Permissions \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t \n\n\n\n\t \n\t\t\n   \n\n   \n\t\t\n   \n\n\n\n  \n   \n\n  \n    \n    \n           \n      \n      \n\n      Post Your Comment \n      \n        Cancel reply \n        Post Your Reply \n      \n\n\t\t\t\n    \n         Please\n          log in \n         or\n          sign up \n         to comment.\n        \n\n \n          \n            \n          \n        \n\n      \n\n        \n          \n          \n        \n\n        \n\n          Enter Your Comment \n\n          \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n             Submit Comment  \n            \n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n\n      \n        \n         Forbes writers have the ability to call out member comments they find particularly interesting.

Sovetsky Soyuz ), was a constitutionally communist state that existed between 1922 and 1991, ruled as a single-party state by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital. [ 3 ] A union of multiple subnational Soviet republics , its government and economy were highly centralized. \n The Soviet Union had its roots in the Russian Revolution of 1917 , which deposed the imperial autocracy . The Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , then overthrew the Provisional Government . The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was established and the Russian Civil War began. The Red Army entered several territories of the former Russian Empire and helped local communists seize power. In 1922, the Bolsheviks were victorious, forming the Soviet Union with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin\'s death in 1924, a troika collective leadership and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state ideology to Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism and initiated a centrally planned economy . As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialisation and collectivisation which laid the basis for its later war effort and dominance after World War II. [ 4 ] However, Stalin repressed both Communist Party members and elements of the population through his authoritarian rule. \n During the first phase of World War II , the Soviet Union used the opportunity to acquire territories in Eastern Europe adjacent to Nazi Germany , its satellites, and their occupied territories. Later in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, opening the largest and bloodiest theatre of war in history and violating an earlier non-aggression pact between the two countries. The Soviet Union suffered the largest loss of life in the war, but halted the Axis advance at intense battles such as that at Stalingrad , eventually driving through Eastern Europe and capturing Berlin in 1945. Having played a decisive role in the Allied victory in Europe, [ 5 ] the Soviet Union established the Eastern Bloc in much of Central and Eastern Europe and emerged as one of the world\'s two superpowers after the war. Together with these new satellite states , through which the Soviet Union established economic and military pacts , it became involved in the Cold War , a prolonged ideological and political struggle against the Western Bloc , led by the other superpower, the United States . \n A de-Stalinization period followed Stalin\'s death, reducing the harshest aspects of society. The Soviet Union then went on to initiate significant technological achievements of the 20th century, including launching the first ever satellite and world\'s first human spaceflight , which led it into the Space Race . The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis marked a period of extreme tension between the two superpowers, considered the closest to a mutual nuclear confrontation. In the 1970s, a relaxation of relations followed, but tensions resumed with Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] \n In the late 1980s the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev , also sought reforms in the Union, introducing the policies of glasnost and perestroika in an attempt to end the period of economic stagnation and democratize the government. However, this led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements. Central authorities initiated a referendum , boycotted by the Baltic republics and Georgia, which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favour of preserving the Union as a renewed federation . In August 1991, a coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat was attempted by hardliners against Gorbachev, with the intention of reversing his moderate policies. The coup failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup but resulted in the restoration [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ] of the Baltic states . On 25&#160;December 1991, Gorbachev resigned and the remaining 12 constituent republics emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union as independent post-Soviet states . [ 11 ] The Russian Federation , successor of the Russian SFSR, assumed the Soviet Union\'s rights and obligations and is recognised as its continued legal personality.

[ 13 ] Covering a sixth of the Earth\'s land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America. [ 14 ] The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country\'s area, and was the cultural and economic center. The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia , was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres (6,200&#160;mi) east to west across 12 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometres (4,500&#160;mi) north to south. It had five climate zones: tundra , taiga , steppes , desert, and mountains. \n The Soviet Union had the world\'s longest boundary, like Russia, measuring over 60,000 kilometres (37,000&#160;mi), or 1 &#160; 1 / 2 circumferences of the Earth . Two-thirds of it were a coastline. Across the Bering Strait was the United States . The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan , China , Czechoslovakia , Finland , Hungary , Iran , Mongolia , North Korea , Norway , Poland , Romania , and Turkey from 1945 to 1991. \n The Soviet Union\'s highest mountain was Communism Peak (now Ismoil Somoni Peak ) in Tajikistan , at 7,495 metres (24,590&#160;ft). The Soviet Union also included most part of the world\'s largest lake, the Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and also Lake Baikal , the world\'s largest freshwater and deepest lake, an internal body of water in Russia. \n History \n Main article: History of the Soviet Union \n The last Russian Tsar , Nicholas II , ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication in March 1917 in the aftermath of the February Revolution , due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I which lacked public support. A short-lived Russian Provisional Government took power, to be overthrown in the October Revolution ( N.S. 7 November 1917) by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin . \n The Soviet Union was officially established in December 1922 with the union of the Russian , Ukrainian , Byelorussian , and Transcaucasian Soviet republics, each ruled by local Bolshevik parties. Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term "Soviet Russia"&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians. \n Revolution and foundation \n Main article: History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917\xe2\x80\x931927) \n Modern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the Decembrist Revolt of 1825. Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavourable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. A parliament\xe2\x80\x94the State Duma \xe2\x80\x94was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905 , but the Tsar resisted attempts to move from absolute to constitutional monarchy . Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major Soviet cities. \n \n \n \n  \n Vladimir Lenin addressing a crowd in 1920. \n \n \n A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd , in response to the wartime decay of Russia\'s economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government in March 1917 . The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I. \n At the same time, workers\' councils, known in Russian as " Soviets ", sprang up across the country. The Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets. On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets. This event would later be known as the Great October Socialist Revolution . In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers , though by February 1918, fighting had resumed. In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk . \n A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites , starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds\' victory. It included foreign intervention , the execution of Nicholas II and his family , and the famine of 1921 , which killed about five million. [ 15 ] In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland , the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia. The Soviet Union had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland , the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Latvia , and the Republic of Lithuania . \n Unification of republics \n On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR , the Transcaucasian SFSR , the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty of Creation of the USSR [ 16 ] and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. [ 17 ] These two documents were confirmed by the 1st Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, [ 18 ]  Mikhail Kalinin , Mikhail Tskhakaya , Mikhail Frunze , Grigory Petrovsky , and Aleksandr Chervyakov , [ 19 ] on 30 December 1922. \n On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the British Empire . The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union. \n An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees , government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan , which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10-to 15-year period. It included construction of a network of 30 regional power plants , including ten large hydroelectric power plants , and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises. [ 20 ] The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931. [ 21 ] \n Stalin era \n Main article: History of the Soviet Union (1927\xe2\x80\x931953) \n \n \n \n  \nStalin and Nikolai Yezhov , head of the NKVD . After Yezhov was executed, he was edited out of the image. \n \n \n From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) . [ 22 ] After the economic policy of " War Communism " during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax (see New Economic Policy ). \n The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of Democratic Centralism would be most effective in representing the people\'s will in a practical manner. Debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin\'s death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a " troika " consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of Ukraine , Lev Kamenev of Moscow, and Joseph Stalin of Georgia . \n On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers\' and Peasants\' Inspectorate , which gave Stalin considerable power. By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmaneuvering his rivals within the party , Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established totalitarian rule. In October 1927, Grigory Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile. \n In 1928, Stalin introduced the First Five-Year Plan for building a socialist economy . While encompassing the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it also aimed to build socialism in one country . In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization. In agriculture, rather than adhering to the "lead by example" policy advocated by Lenin, [ 23 ] forced collectivisation of farms was implemented all over the country. \n Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths; surviving kulaks were persecuted and many sent to Gulags to do forced labour . [ 24 ] Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s. Stalin\'s Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many " Old Bolsheviks " who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin. According to declassified Soviet archives, in 1937 and 1938, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people, of whom 681,692 were shot \xe2\x80\x93 an average of 1,000 executions a day. [ 25 ] The excess deaths during the 1930s as a whole were in the range of 10\xe2\x80\x9311 million. [ 26 ] Yet despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the Soviet Union developed a powerful industrial economy in the years before World War II . \n 1930s \n The early 1930s saw closer cooperation between the West and the USSR. From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference . In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt chose to formally recognize Stalin\'s Communist government and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two nations. [ 27 ] In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations . After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists , who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany . \n In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution . The constitution was seen as a personal triumph for Stalin, who on this occasion was described by Pravda as a "genius of the new world, the wisest man of the epoch, the great leader of communism." By contrast, Western historians and historians from former Soviet occupied countries have viewed the constitution as a meaningless propaganda document. \n The late 1930s saw a shift towards the Axis powers . In 1938, after the United Kingdom and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the USSR dealt with the Nazis as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks . The two countries concluded the German\xe2\x80\x93Soviet Nonaggression Pact and the German\xe2\x80\x93Soviet Commercial Agreement . The nonaggression pact made possible Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia , Bessarabia, northern Bukovina , and eastern Poland . In late November of the same year, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16&#160;mi) back from Leningrad , Joseph Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland . \n In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Japanese Empire in 1938 and 1939. However, in April 1941, USSR signed the Soviet\xe2\x80\x93Japanese Neutrality Pact with the Empire of Japan , recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo , a Japanese puppet state . \n World War II \n Main article: Eastern Front (World War II) \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet soldiers in Berlin, May 1945. \n \n \n Although it has been debated whether the Soviet Union intended to invade Germany once it was strong enough, [ 28 ] Germany itself broke the treaty and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, starting what was known in the USSR as the " Great Patriotic War ". The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow , aided by an unusually harsh winter. The Battle of Stalingrad , which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to the Germans from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945 . The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front. [ 29 ] \n \n \n \n  \nLeft to right: Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin , U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill confer in Tehran in 1943 . \n \n \n The same year, the USSR, in fulfillment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference , denounced the Soviet\xe2\x80\x93Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 [ 30 ] and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945. [ 31 ]  This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. \n The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people . [ 32 ] Despite this, it emerged as a superpower in the post-war period. Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every nation by the late 1940s. A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions (see Soviet Union and the United Nations ). \n The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the world\'s two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries , and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry. \n Cold War \n Main article: Cold War \n During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its strictly centralized control . It aided post-war reconstruction in the countries of Eastern Europe, while turning them into satellite states , binding them in a military alliance (the Warsaw Pact ) in 1955, and an economic organization ( The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon) from 1949 to 1991, the latter a counterpart to the European Economic Community . [ 33 ] Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Chinese Communist Party , and saw its influence grow elsewhere in the world. Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union\'s wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly using mostly proxies. \n Khrushchev era \n Main article: History of the Soviet Union (1953\xe2\x80\x931964) \n \n \n \n  \nThe Soviet Union and other countries in the world under a communist government modelled on the country, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sino\xe2\x80\x93Soviet split of 1961. \n \n \n Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly. Nikita Khrushchev , who had won the power struggle by the mid-1950s, denounced Stalin\'s use of repression in 1956 and eased repressive controls over party and society. This was known as de-Stalinization . \n Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a buffer zone for the forward defense of its western borders, and ensured its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956. \n In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSR\'s rapprochement with the West and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev\'s revisionism led to the Sino\xe2\x80\x93Soviet split . This resulted in a break throughout the global Communist movement, with Communist regimes in Albania , Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China in place of the USSR. \n During this period, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits: Launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957; a living dog, Laika in 1957; the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963; Alexey Leonov , the first person to walk in space in 1965; the first soft landing on moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 . [ 34 ] \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , first human to travel into space \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Lunokhod 1 rover landed on the Moon on 17 November 1970. \n \n \n Khrushchev initiated "The Thaw" (better known as Khrushchev\'s Thaw ), a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. \n Khrushchev\'s reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove enemy nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964. \n Brezhnev era \n Main articles: History of the Soviet Union (1964\xe2\x80\x931982) and Era of Stagnation \n Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader. In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms. \n \n \n \n  \nPresidents Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter sign the SALT II arms limitation treaty in Vienna on 18 June 1979. \n \n \n Brezhnev presided over a period of d\xc3\xa9tente with the West (see SALT I , SALT II , Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ) while at the same time building up Soviet military might. \n In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev\'s death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnev\'s rule had come to be dubbed one of "standstill", with an aging and ossified top political leadership. \n Reforms and dissolution \n Main articles: Cold War (1985\xe2\x80\x931991) , History of the Soviet Union (1982\xe2\x80\x931991) , Dissolution of the Soviet Union , 1991 Soviet coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat attempt , and Commonwealth of Independent States \n \n \n \n  \n Mikhail Gorbachev in one-to-one discussions with U.S. President Ronald Reagan . \n \n \n Two developments dominated the decade that followed: the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Union\'s economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, so that the USSR\'s hard currency reserves became depleted. [ 35 ] \n Brezhnev\'s next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev . \n Gorbachev made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika . His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship. \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet troops withdrawing from Afghanistan in 1988. \n \n \n Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces. In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the Soviet Union\'s former satellite states, resulting in the toppling of multiple communist regimes. With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain came down. \n In the late 1980s, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. [ 36 ] On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum. [ 37 ] Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the " War of Laws ". \n In 1989, the Russian SFSR , which was then the largest constituent republic (with about half of the population) convened a newly elected Congress of People\'s Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia\'s sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR\'s laws. The period of legal uncertainty continued throughout 1991 as constituent republics slowly became de facto independent. \n A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991, with the majority of the population voting for preservation of the Union in nine out of the 15 republics. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty , which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. \n \n \n \n  \n Boris Yeltsin stands on a tank in Moscow to defy the August Coup (1991). \n \n \n The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup \xe2\x80\x94an attempted coup d\'\xc3\xa9tat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev\'s reforms and reassert the central government\'s control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev\'s power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania\'s 1990 example), while the other twelve republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. \n On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus signed the Belavezha Accords , which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol , which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev yielded to the inevitable and resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin, the President of Russia . \n The following day, the Supreme Soviet , the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, dissolved itself. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state. The Soviet Army remained in place in the early months of 1992, but was thereafter absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states. \n Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized [ 38 ] as its legal successor on the international stage. To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed overseas Soviet properties as its own. Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol , Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union\'s rights and obligations. \n Post-Soviet States \n The analysis of the succession of states with respect to the 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is seen as the continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union , retaining ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties and UN Security Council seat. [ 39 ] The Baltic states are not successor states to the Soviet Union [ 40 ] ; they are considered to have de jure continuity with their pre- World War Two governments through the non-recognition of the original Soviet incorporation in 1940. [ 39 ] The other 11 post-Soviet states are considered newly independent successor states to the Soviet Union.

[ 41 ] \n Communist Party \n Main article: Communist Party of the Soviet Union \n At the top of the Communist Party was the Central Committee , elected at Party Congresses and Conferences. The Central Committee in turn voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952\xe2\x80\x931966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the USSR. [ 42 ] Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country [ 43 ] (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941). [ 44 ] They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism , demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above. [ 45 ] \n The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state largely through its control over the system of appointments . All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin in 1941\xe2\x80\x931953 and Khrushchev in 1958\xe2\x80\x931964 were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, [ 46 ] but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal head of state . The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations . [ 47 ] \n In practice, however, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party. [ 48 ] Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned. [ 49 ] \n Government \n Main article: Government of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nThe Grand Kremlin Palace , seat of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union , in 1982. \n \n \n The Supreme Soviet (successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee ) was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, [ 50 ] at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party. However, the powers and functions of the Supreme Soviet were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained additional powers when it came to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the Soviet state budget . [ 51 ] The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, [ 52 ] ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court , [ 53 ] the Procurator General [ 54 ] and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People\'s Commissars ), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society. [ 52 ] State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees , local Soviets and executive committees . While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary. [ 55 ] \n The state security police (the KGB and its predecessor agencies) played an important role in Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the Stalinist terror , [ 56 ] but after the death of Stalin, the state security police was brought under strict party control. Under Yuri Andropov , KGB chairman in 1967\xe2\x80\x931982 and General Secretary from 1982 to 1983, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, [ 57 ] culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [ 58 ] \n Separation of power and reform \n Main article: Perestroika \n The Soviet constitutions , which were promulgated in 1918 , 1924 , 1936 and 1977 , [ 59 ] did not limit state power. No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers [ 60 ] that represented executive and legislative branches of the government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin [ 61 ] and Joseph Stalin , [ 62 ] as well as after Khrushchev\'s dismissal , [ 63 ] itself due to a coup in both the Politburo and the Central Committee. [ 64 ] All Soviet party leaders before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov [ 65 ] and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party. [ 64 ] \n Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them. The Congress of People\'s Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989. The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, much stronger than before. For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers. [ 66 ] In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union , concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, [ 67 ] now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR , to himself. [ 68 ] \n Tensions grew between the union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR , and Communist Party hardliners. On 19\xe2\x80\x9321 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged an abortive coup attempt . Following the failed coup, the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power "in the period of transition". [ 69 ] Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR. [ 70 ] \n Judicial system \n Main articles: Law of the Soviet Union and Socialist law \n The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts ( People\'s Court ) and applied the law as established by the Constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law , where the judge, procurator , and defense attorney collaborate to establish the truth. [ 71 ] \n Administrative divisions \n Main articles: Soviet Republic (system of government) and Republics of the Soviet Union \n Constitutionally, the Soviet Union was a union of Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs) and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), although the rule of the highly centralized Communist Party made the union merely nominal. [ 41 ] The Treaty on the Creation of the USSR was signed in December 1922 by four founding republics, the RSFSR, Transcaucasian SFSR , Ukrainian SSR and Belorussian SSR . In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, the Uzbek and Turkmen SSRs were formed from parts of the RSFSR\'s Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSR . In 1929, the Tajik SSR was split off from the Uzbek SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the constituents of the Transcaucasian SFSR, namely the Georgian , Armenian and Azerbaijan SSRs , were elevated to union republics, while the Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs were split off from the RSFSR. [ 72 ] In August 1940, the Soviet Union formed the Moldavian SSR from parts of the Ukrainian SSR and parts of Bessarabia annexed from Romania . It also annexed the Baltic states as the Estonian , Latvian and Lithuanian SSRs . The Karelo-Finnish SSR was split off from the RSFSR in March 1940 and merged back in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics (see map below). [ 73 ] \n On 16 November 1988, the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR passed the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration that asserted Estonia\'s sovereignty and declared the supremacy of Estonian laws over those of the Soviet Union. [ 74 ] In March 1990, the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR declared independence , followed by the Georgian Supreme Soviet in April 1991. Although the symbolic right of the republics to secede was nominally guaranteed by the constitution and the union treaty, [ 41 ] Soviet authorities at first refused to recognize it. After the August coup attempt, most of the other republics followed suit. The Soviet Union ultimately recognized the secession of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on 6 September 1991. The remaining republics were recognized as independent with the Soviet Union\'s final dissolution in December 1991.

The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War Communism , which involved nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate the circulation of money, as well as private enterprises and free trade . As it had suffered a severe economic collapse caused by the war, in 1921, Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP), legalizing free trade and private ownership of smaller businesses. The economy quickly recovered. [ 76 ] \n Following a lengthy debate among the members of Politburo over the course of economic development, by 1928\xe2\x80\x931929, upon gaining control of the country , Joseph Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization , which greatly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. [ 76 ] Preparation for war was one of the main driving forces behind industrialization, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalistic world. [ 77 ] As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II . [ 78 ] During the war, the Soviet economy and infrastructure suffered massive devastation and required extensive reconstruction. [ 79 ] \n By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient ; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon , only a very small share of domestic products was traded internationally. [ 80 ] After the creation of the Eastern Bloc , external trade rose rapidly. Still the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade . [ 81 ] Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. [ 80 ] During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World . Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states . [ 80 ] \n From the 1930s until its collapse in the late 1980s, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by central planning , carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans . In practice, however, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors. All key economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were normally denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods. Credit was discouraged, but widespread. Final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice the actual prices were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links (between producer factories etc.) were widespread. [ 76 ] \n A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and healthcare. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defense were assigned higher priority than the production of consumer goods . [ 82 ] Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited choice. Under command economy, consumers had almost no influence over production, so the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. [ 83 ] A massive unplanned second economy grew up alongside the planned one at low levels, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. Legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965 . [ 76 ] \n Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, [ 84 ]  [ 85 ] by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet economy experienced comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West. [ 86 ] However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of increase in capital was only surpassed by Japan). [ 76 ] \n Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries). [ citation needed ] According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly , growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income of Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice as high as it was considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to low productivity of capital in the Soviet Union. [ 87 ] Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living actually declined as a result of Stalin\'s despotism, and while there was a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. [ 88 ] \n In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika . His policies relaxed state control over enterprises, but did not yet allow it to be replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in production output. The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues , started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [ 76 ]  [ 83 ] For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP ( PPP ), and was 3rd in the world during the middle of the 1980s to 1989. [ 89 ] though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries. [ 90 ] \n Energy \n Main article: Energy policy of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet stamp depicting the 30th anniversary of the International Atomic Energy Agency . \n \n \n The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, [ 91 ] both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the start, this decline grew very rapidly, but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, [ clarification needed ] only 2.6 percent. [ 92 ] David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR\'s collapse. [ 93 ] The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2\xe2\x80\x932.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields [ clarification needed ] . [ 94 ] However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country\'s high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre- Gorbachev era ). [ 95 ] \n In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres (51,000&#160;mi) for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres (128,300&#160;mi) for natural gas. [ 96 ] Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported. [ 97 ] In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency . [ 80 ] At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia . [ 98 ] \n Science and technology \n Main article: Science and technology in the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet stamp showing the orbit of Sputnik . \n \n \n The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, [ 99 ] however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the world\'s first space satellite , typically were the responsibility of the military. [ 82 ] Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin\'s belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations. By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the world\'s best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics , selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies. Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy , the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World . \n Project Socrates , under the Reagan administration , determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology, while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, in addition, the Soviet Union\'s technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. It was this significant lack of flexibility that was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform. [ 100 ]  [ 101 ]  [ 102 ] \n Transport \n Main article: Transport in the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \n Aeroflot \'s flag during the Soviet era. \n \n \n Transport was a key component of the nation\'s economy . The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot , an aviation enterprise . [ 103 ] The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. [ 96 ] However, due to bad maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World. [ 104 ] \n Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world; [ 104 ] it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts. [ 105 ] By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burden from the railways and to improve the Soviet state budget . [ 106 ] The road network and automobile industry [ 107 ] remained underdeveloped, [ 108 ] and dirt roads were common outside major cities. [ 109 ] Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones. [ 109 ] Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction. [ 110 ] The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport. [ 111 ] \n Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services. \n The Soviet merchant fleet was one of the largest in the world. [ 96 ] \n Demographics \n Main article: Demographics of the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nPopulation of the USSR (red) and the post-Soviet states (blue) from 1961 to 2009. \n \n \n The first fifty years of the 20th century in tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union were marked by a succession of disasters, each accompanied by large\xe2\x80\x93scale population losses. Excess deaths over the course of World War I and the Russian Civil War (including the postwar famine ) amounted to a combined total of 18 million, [ 112 ] some 10 million in the 1930s, [ 26 ] and more than 26 million in 1941\xe2\x80\x935. The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued. [ 32 ] \n The crude birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, largely due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The crude death rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well \xe2\x80\x93 from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post\xe2\x80\x93World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics. [ 113 ] Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility , while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility. [ 114 ] \n The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. [ 115 ] An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. [ 116 ] The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. [ 117 ] The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real causes. [ 118 ] \n Education \n Main article: Education in the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nSoviet pupils in Milovice , Czechoslovakia , 1985. \n \n \n Before 1917, education was not free in the Russian Empire and was therefore either inaccessible or barely accessible for many children from lower-class working and peasant families. Estimates from 1917 recorded that 75\xe2\x80\x9385 percent of the Russian population was illiterate . \n Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first People\'s Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia. At the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy. People who were literate were automatically hired as teachers. For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Joseph Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated. In the aftermath of the Great Patriotic War, the country\'s educational system expanded dramatically. This expansion had a tremendous effect. In the 1960s, nearly all Soviet children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas. Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also became important in creating the New Soviet Man . [ 119 ] \n Only 20 percent of applicants were accepted. The rest entered the labor market or learned a skill at a vocational technical school or technicum [ dubious \xe2\x80\x93 discuss ] . Students from families of dubious political reliability were barred from higher education. [ 120 ] The Brezhnev administration introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary. [ 121 ] According to statistics from 1986, the number of students per 10,000 population was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US. [ 122 ] \n Ethnic groups \n \n \n \n  \n1974 USSR geographic location of ethnicities. \n \n \n The Soviet Union was a very ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups. The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians (50.78%), followed by Ukrainians (15.45%) and Uzbeks (5.84%). [ 123 ] \n All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen [ 124 ] by the child\'s parents. If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of the Georgian SSR , who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians . [ 125 ] Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, Belarusians , and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years. [ 126 ] [ neutrality is disputed ] \n Health \n Main article: Health care in the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nAn early Soviet-era poster discouraging unsafe abortion practices. \n \n \n In 1917, before the Bolshevik uprising, health conditions were significantly behind the developed countries. As Lenin later noted, "Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice". [ 127 ] The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People\'s Commissariat for Health in 1918. Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, this at the time being a revolutionary concept. Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before Leonid Brezhnev became head of state, the healthcare system of the Soviet Union was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed however, from Brezhnev\'s accession and Mikhail Gorbachev \'s tenure as leader, the Soviet health care system was heavily criticised for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision. [ 128 ]  Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov , during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , while highlighting such Soviet successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognised the system\'s areas for improvement and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered. [ 129 ] \n After the socialist revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system . These improvements continued into the 1960s, when the life expectancy in the Soviet Union surpassed that of the United States. It remained stable during most years, although in the 1970s, it went down slightly, possibly because of alcohol abuse . At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on this. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was highest, while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union. [ 130 ] The USSR had several centers of excellence, such as the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex , founded in 1988 by Russian eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fyodorov . \n Language \n Main article: Languages of the Soviet Union \n The Soviet government headed by Vladimir Lenin gave small language groups their own writing systems. [ 131 ] The development of these writing systems was very successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other. [ 132 ] When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, that language would attain "official language" status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore their speakers were forced to have a second language . [ 133 ] There are examples where the Soviet government retreated from this policy, most notable under Stalin\'s regime, where education was discontinued in languages which were not widespread enough. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian. [ 134 ] During the Great Patriotic War (World War II), some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy. [ 135 ] \n As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Union\'s many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language as the "language of interethnic communication" ( Russian : \xd1\x8f\xd0\xb7\xd1\x8b\xd0\xba \xd0\xbc\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb6\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb3\xd0\xbe \xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f ), but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990. [ 136 ] \n Religion \n Main article: Religion in the Soviet Union \n \n \n \n  \nThe Cathedral of Christ the Saviour , Moscow , during its demolition in 1931. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nGeneral Secretary Leonid Brezhnev toasts with Russian Orthodox clergymen and a rabbi at a celebration in 1977 of the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution . \n \n \n Christianity and Islam had the greatest number of adherents among the Soviet state\'s religious citizens. [ 137 ]  Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia\'s traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the Soviet Union\'s largest Christian denomination . About 90 percent of the Soviet Union\'s Muslims were Sunnis , with Shiites concentrated in the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic . [ 137 ] Smaller groups included Roman Catholics , Jews , Buddhists , and a variety of Protestant sects. [ 137 ] \n Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions. [ 138 ] The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes . [ 139 ] \n In Soviet law, the "freedom to hold religious services" was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism . [ 139 ] In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups. [ 139 ] \n The 1918 Council of People\'s Commissars decree establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) as a secular state also decreed that "the teaching of religion in all [places] where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately." [ 140 ] Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929, a half-decade into Stalin\'s rule, included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study . [ 139 ] Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, as many as 90 percent of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed. [ 141 ] \n Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s. [ 142 ] Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during the Soviet war with Nazi Germany . Amid other accommodations to religious faith, churches were reopened, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow was held in 1943. [ 142 ] The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths. [ 143 ] \n The Soviet establishment again clashed with the churches under General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev \'s leadership in 1958\xe2\x80\x931964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views. [ 142 ] During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97. [ 144 ] The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade. [ 144 ] \n Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era . [ 145 ] Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the Soviet government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour . [ 146 ] A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 percent of the Soviet population as "active religious believers." [ 147 ] \n Although the Russian Orthodox Church maintained a cozy relationship with the Communists, the Ukrainian Catholic Church was suppressed in Soviet-controlled Ukraine until 1989. \n Culture \n Main article: Culture of the Soviet Union \n See also: Soviet cuisine \n \n \n  Sorry, your browser either has JavaScript disabled or does not have any supported player. \nYou can download the clip or download a player to play the clip in your browser. \n \n  \nThe Enthusiast\'s March , a 1930s song famous in the Soviet Union. \n \n \n The culture of the Soviet Union passed through several stages during the USSR\'s 70-year existence. During the first eleven years following the Revolution (1918\xe2\x80\x931929), there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, for example Nikolay Gumilev (shot for conspiring against the Bolshevik regime) and Yevgeny Zamyatin (banned). [ 148 ] \n \n \n \n  \n Walking the Streets of Moscow was an iconic Soviet film of the 1960s. \n \n \n The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers Maksim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time. Film, as a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, received encouragement from the state; much of director Sergei Eisenstein \'s best work dates from this period. \n Later, during Stalin\'s rule, Soviet culture was characterised by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism , with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, for example Mikhail Bulgakov \'s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed. [ 149 ] \n Following the Khrushchev Thaw of the late 1950s and early 1960s, censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed characterized by conformist public life and intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms were again permissible, with the result that more sophisticated and subtly critical work began to be produced. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. An underground dissident literature, known as samizdat , developed during this late period. In architecture the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin\'s epoch. \n In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev\'s policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression in the media and press.

"The new evidence shows that administrative command planning and Stalin\'s forced industrialisation strategies failed in the 1930s and beyond. The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact. It is the statistical artefact not of index number relativity (the Gerschenkron effect) but of misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure competitive value. The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalin\'s despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn &amp; Zemskov\'s relatively favourable characterisation of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism. The evidence demonstrates that the suppression of markets and the oppression of vast segments of the population were economically counterproductive and humanly calamitous, just as anyone conversant with classical economic theory should have expected." &#160; \n ^  Central Intelligence Agency (1991).

In Germany, two major communist trends emerged. First, the Spartacus League was created by the radical socialist Rosa Luxemburg . The second trend emerged amongst the German rank-and-file trade unionists who opposed their unions and organized increasingly radical strikes towards the end of 1917 and the beginning of 1918. This second trend created the German Left Communist movement that would become the KAPD after the abortive German Revolution of 1918\xe2\x80\x9319 . \n As the Communist International inspired by the Bolshevik revolution in Russia formed, a Left Communist tendency developed in the Comintern\'s German, Dutch and Bulgarian sections. Key figures in this milieu were Anton Pannekoek , [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  Otto R\xc3\xbchle and Herman Gorter . In the United Kingdom, Sylvia Pankhurst \'s group, the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) , also identified with the Left Communist tendency. \n Alongside these formal Left Communist tendencies, the Italian group led by Amadeo Bordiga is often commonly recognized as a Left Communist party, although both Bordiga and the Italian Communist Left disputed this and qualified their politics as separate, distinct and more in line with the Third International \'s positions than the politics of Left Communism. Bordiga himself did not advocate abstention from the unions, although later Italian Left currents developed a critique of the "regime unions", positing that most or all unions had become tools of capitalism by submitting themselves to bourgeois interests and were no longer viable as organs of class struggle. Nevertheless, those "Bordigists" who put forward this critique still held out the necessity of "red unions" or "class unions" re-emerging, outside and against the regime unions, which would openly advocate class struggle and allow the participation of communist militants . \n These various assorted groups were all criticized by Vladimir Lenin in his booklet "Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder . \n Despite a common general direction, and despite sharing the criticism of Lenin, there were few politics held in common between these movements. An example of this divergence is that the Italians supported the Right of Nations to Self Determination , while the Dutch and Germans rejected this policy (seeing it as a form of bourgeois nationalism ). However, all of the Left Communist tendencies opposed what they called " Frontism ". Frontism was a tactic endorsed by Lenin, where Communists sought tactical agreements with reformist ( social democratic ) parties in pursuit of a definite, usually defensive, goal. In addition to opposing "Frontism", the Dutch-German tendency, the Bulgarians and British also refused to participate in bourgeois elections, which they denounced as parliamentarism . \n In Germany, the Left Communists were expelled from the Communist Party of Germany , and they formed the Communist Workers Party (KAPD). Similar parties were formed in the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Britain. The KAPD rapidly lost most of its members and it eventually dissolved. However, some of its militants had been instrumental in organising factory-based unions like the AAUD and AAUD-E, the latter being opposed to separate party organisation (see: Syndicalism ). \n The leading theoreticians of the KAPD had developed a new series of ideas based on their opposition to party organisation, and their conception of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia as having been a bourgeois revolution. Their leading figures were Anton Pannekoek , Herman Gorter and Otto R\xc3\xbchle . R\xc3\xbchle later left the KAPD, and was one of the founders of the AAUD-E. Another leading theoretician of Council Communism was Paul Mattick , who later emigrated to the USA. A minor figure in the Council Communist movement in the Netherlands was Marinus van der Lubbe , who was accused of the Reichstag arson in 1933 and consequently executed by the nazis after a show trial that marked the beginning of the persecution of socialist and communists in Nazi Germany . \n The early councilists are followed later by the Group of Internationalist Communists , Henk Meijer , Cajo Brendel and Paul Mattick , Sr. There was a resurgence of councilist groups and ideas in the New Left of the 1960s, through the Situationist International , Root and Branch in the United States, Socialisme ou Barbarie in France, and Solidarity in the UK. [ 3 ] \n Alongside and sometimes connected to the councilists were the early Hegelian Marxists, Gy\xc3\xb6rgy Luk\xc3\xa1cs (a council communist himself from 1918\xe2\x80\x9321 or 22) and Karl Korsch (who turned to council communism in the 1930s). [ citation needed ] \n [ edit ] Ideology \n Chief among the tenets of Council Communism is its opposition to the party vanguardism [ 1 ]  [ 4 ] and democratic centralism [ 5 ] of Leninist Ideologies and its contention that democratic workers\' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council Communism also stands in contrast to Social Democracy through its formal rejection of both the reformism and Parliamentarism . [ 6 ] \n [ edit ] Council communism and the Soviets of the USSR \n During the Russian Revolution of 1917 , councils akin to those advocated by Council Communists were a significant political and organizational force; with the Russian word "soviet" itself meaning council. After the success of the February Revolution , the Bolsheviks sought to capitalize on the influence of the soviets in order to boost their own popularity. Bolshevik leaders advocated the transference of authority to the soviets and the dissolution of Russian Provisional Government by means of a second revolution. When this campaign was successful and the October Revolution occurred, the creation of the Congress of Soviets marked the beginning of a process by which the genuine workers\' control of the soviets was diminished and the decisions of the Bolshevik Party acquired the full authority of the State. By the time new regime had developed into a single-party system , the Supreme Soviet (successor to the Congress of Soviets ) had been relegated to the role of a rubber-stamp parliament, meeting just once a year to ratify decisions already made at higher levels, in most cases without even a single dissenting vote. Real power was concentrated in the hands of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . \n On the topic of the Russian Revolution, Council Communists maintain that the February Revolution and the soviets of the era were proletarian in nature. However, in their view, the ascent of the Bolsheviks and the following creation of a party bureaucracy constituted a " bourgeois revolution"; with the Soviet Union itself being an example of state capitalism rather than the Dictatorship of the Proletariat . [ 7 ] With the Soviet state \'s exclusive control over the utilization of capital , it is argued by Council Communists that the party bureaucracy had simply taken the place of individual capitalists and established its own form of capitalist class relations; emphasized in part by the continued defence and perpetuation of capitalist relations after the revolution by means of the New Economic Policy . \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Anarcho-communism \n De Leonism \n Left communism \n Libertarian Marxism \n Libertarian socialism \n List of left communist internationals \n Luxemburgism \n Participatory politics \n Social criticism \n \n [ edit ] Notes \n \n \n ^  a   b  Anton Pannekoek (1936) Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Councils \n ^  Anton Pannekoek (1938) Lenin as philosopher - a critical examination of the philosophical basis of Leninism \n ^  A libertarian Marxist tendency map (Libcom.org) \n ^  Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga - Gilles Dauv\xc3\xa9 \n ^  Pannekoek, Anton.

It was founded around the Manifesto of the Fourth Communist International , published by the Communist Workers\' Party of Germany (KAPD) in 1921. \n The organisation was founded in 1922, following a split in the KAPD, by members of the Essen Faction, including Herman Gorter and Karl Schr\xc3\xb6der , the Berlin Faction holding that the formation of an international was premature. It was joined by the Communist Workers\' Party of the Netherlands , Sylvia Pankhurst \'s Communist Workers\' Party in Britain , the Left Communists in Russia (who accordingly renamed themselves the Communist Workers\' Party ), the Communist Workers\' Group in Russia and some left communists in Belgium and Bulgaria . \n The International was never able to organise joint activities and probably never reached 1,000 members. It was weakened by the dissolution of some of its members groups, and the departure of the Russian Communist Workers\' Group, who disagreed with its opposition to a united front with the Third International . The KAI appears to have disbanded in the mid-1920s. \n [ edit ] References \n \n Richard Gombin, The Radical Tradition: Council Communism \n Herman Gorter, The World Revolution \n Commentary on Herman Gorter\'s Open Letter to Comrade Lenin \n Tibor Szamuely, The Communist Left in Russia after 1920 \n \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tRetrieved from " http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Communist_Workers%27_International&amp;oldid=542019601 "\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Categories : Political parties established in 1921 Left-wing internationals Council communism  Hidden categories: Articles containing German language text  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Navigation menu \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Personal tools \n\t \n Create account Log in \t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Namespaces \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Article \n\t\t\t\t\t Talk \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t Variants \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Views \n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Read \n\t\t\t\t\t Edit \n\t\t\t\t\t View history \n\t\t\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Actions \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Search \n\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t Navigation \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Main page \n\t\t\t Contents \n\t\t\t Featured content \n\t\t\t Current events \n\t\t\t Random article \n\t\t\t Donate to Wikipedia \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\t Interaction \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t\t About Wikipedia \n\t\t\t Community portal \n\t\t\t Recent changes \n\t\t\t Contact Wikipedia \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Toolbox \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t What links here \n\t\t\t Related changes \n\t\t\t Upload file \n\t\t\t Special pages \n\t\t\t Permanent link \n\t\t\t Page information \n Cite this page \t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Print/export \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Create a book \n\t\t\t Download as PDF \n\t\t\t Printable version \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\n \n\t Languages \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Catal\xc3\xa0 \n\t\t\t Espa\xc3\xb1ol \n\t\t\t Fran\xc3\xa7ais \n\t\t\t Edit links \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last modified on 4 March 2013 at 09:09. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Text is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License ;\nadditional terms may apply.

[ 3 ] This movement, in its Marxist\xe2\x80\x93Leninist interpretations, significantly influenced the history of the 20th century, which saw intense rivalry between the "socialist world" ( socialist states ruled by communist parties ) and the "western world" (countries with capitalist economies ). [ 4 ] \n Marxist theory holds that pure communism or full communism is a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the productive forces that leads to a superabundance of material wealth, allowing for distribution based on need and social relations based on freely associated individuals . [ 5 ]  [ 6 ] The exact definition of communism varies, and it is often mistakenly, in general political discourse, used interchangeably with socialism ; however, Marxist theory contends that socialism is just a transitional stage on the road to communism. Leninism adds to Marxism the notion of a vanguard party to lead the proletarian revolution and to secure all political power after the revolution for the working class, for the development of universal class consciousness and worker participation , in a transitional stage between capitalism and communism. \n Council communists and non-Marxist libertarian communists and anarcho-communists oppose the ideas of a vanguard party and a transition stage, and advocate for the construction of full communism to begin immediately upon the abolition of capitalism. There is a very wide range of theories amongst those particular communists in regards to how to build the types of institutions that would replace the various economic engines (such as food distribution, education, and hospitals) as they exist under capitalist systems\xe2\x80\x94or even whether to do so at all. Some of these communists have specific plans for the types of administrative bodies that would replace the current ones, while always qualifying that these bodies would be decentralised and worker-owned , just as they currently are within the activist movements themselves. Others have no concrete set of post-revolutionary blueprints at all, claiming instead that they simply trust that the world\'s workers and poor will figure out proper modes of distribution and wide-scale production, and also coordination, entirely on their own, without the need for any structured "replacements" for capitalist state-based control. [ citation needed ] \n In the modern lexicon of what many sociologists and political commentators refer to as the "political mainstream", communism is often used to refer to the policies of communist states, i.e., the ones totally controlled by communist parties , regardless of the practical content of the actual economic system they may preside over. Examples of this include the policies of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam where the economic system incorporates " doi moi ", the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) where the economic system incorporates " socialist market economy ", and the economic system of the Soviet Union which has been described as " state capitalist ". \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Etymology and terminology \n 2 History \n \n 2.1 Early Communism \n 2.2 Modern Communism \n 2.3 Cold War \n 2.4 After the collapse of the Soviet Union \n \n \n 3 Marxist Communism \n \n 3.1 Marxism \n 3.2 Leninism and Marxism-Leninism \n 3.3 Leninism \n 3.4 Stalinism \n 3.5 Trotskyism \n 3.6 Maoism \n 3.7 Prachanda Path \n 3.8 Hoxhaism \n 3.9 Titoism \n 3.10 Juche \n 3.11 Eurocommunism \n 3.12 Libertarian Marxism \n 3.13 Council Communism \n 3.14 Left Communism \n 3.15 Situationism \n 3.16 Autonomism \n \n \n 4 Non-Marxist Communism \n \n 4.1 Anarchist Communism \n 4.2 Christian Communism \n \n \n 5 Criticism \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n 8 External links \n \n \n \n \n Etymology and terminology \n Communism comes from the Latin word communis , which means "shared" or "belong to all". [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] \n In the schema of historical materialism , communism is the idea of a free society with no division or alienation, where the people are free from oppression and scarcity. A communist society would have no governments, countries, or class divisions. In Marxist theory , the dictatorship of the proletariat is the intermediate system between capitalism and communism, when the government is in the process of changing the means of ownership from privatism to collective ownership. [ 9 ] In political science , the term "communism" is sometimes used to refer to communist states , a form of government in which the state operates under a one-party system and declares allegiance to Marxism-Leninism or a derivative thereof. [ citation needed ] \n \n \n \n  \nThe hammer and sickle and the red star are universal symbols of communism . \n \n \n In modern usage, the word "communism" is still often used to refer to the policies of self-declared socialist governments comprising one-party states which were single legal political party systems operating under centrally planned economies and a state ownership of the means of production , with the state, in turn, claiming that it represented the interests of the working classes . A significant sector of the modern communist movement alleges that these states never made an attempt to transition to a communist society, while others even argue that they never achieved a legitimate socialism. Most of these governments claimed to base their ideology on Marxism-Leninism (though this, too, may be erroneous), but they did not call the system they had set up "communism", nor did they even necessarily claim at all times that the ideology was the sole driving force behind their policies: Mao Zedong , for example, pursued New Democracy , and Vladimir Lenin in the early 1920s enacted war communism ; later, the Vietnamese enacted doi moi , and the Chinese switched to socialism with Chinese characteristics . The governments labeled by other governments as "communist" generally claimed that they had set up a transitional socialist system. This system is sometimes referred to as state socialism or by other similar names. \n " Pure communism " is a term sometimes used to refer to the stage in history after socialism, although just as many communists use simply the term "communism" to refer to that stage; the term is synonymous with " full communism ". The classless, stateless society that characterises this communism is one in which decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made in the best interests of the whole of society, a society \'of, by, and for the working class\', rather than one in which a rich class controls the wealth and everyone else works for the rich on a wage basis. In such a full communism the interests of every member of society is given equal weight in the practical decision-making process in both the political and economic spheres of life. Karl Marx , as well as some other communist philosophers, deliberately never provided a detailed description as to how communism would function as a social system, nor the precise ways in which the working class could or should rise up, nor any other material specifics of exactly how to get to communism from capitalism. In the Communist Manifesto , Marx does lay out a 10-point plan advising the redistribution of land and production to begin the transition to communism, but he ensured that even this was very general and all-encompassing. It has always been presumed that Marx intended these theories to read this way specifically so that later theorists in specific situations could adapt communism to their own localities and conditions. \n History \n \n \n \n  \nCountries of the world now (red) or previously (orange) which were led by nominally communist (Marxist-Leninist) governments, often erroneously called "communist states" in the West . \n \n \n Main article: History of communism \n Early Communism \n Further information: Primitive communism ,&#160; Religious communism ,&#160;and&#160; Utopian socialism \n The origins of communism are debatable, and there are various historical groups, as well as theorists, whose beliefs have been subsequently described as communist. German philosopher Karl Marx saw primitive communism as the original, hunter-gatherer state of humankind from which it arose. For Marx, only after humanity was capable of producing surplus , did private property develop. The idea of a classless society first emerged in Ancient Greece . [ 10 ]  Plato in his The Republic described it as a state where people shared all their property, wives, and children: "The private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have become common, and in some way see and hear and act in common, and all men express praise and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions." [ 10 ] \n In the history of Western thought , certain elements of the idea of a society based on common ownership of property can be traced back to ancient times . Examples include the Spartacus slave revolt in Rome. [ 11 ] The 5th century Mazdak movement in Iran has been described as "communistic" for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy, criticizing the institution of private property and for striving for an egalitarian society. [ 12 ] \n At one time or another, various small communist communities existed, generally under the inspiration of Scripture . [ 13 ] In the medieval Christian church , for example, some monastic communities and religious orders shared their land and other property (see Religious and Christian communism ). These groups often believed that concern with private property was a distraction from religious service to God and neighbour. [ citation needed ] \n Communist thought has also been traced back to the work of 16th century English writer Thomas More . In his treatise Utopia (1516), More portrayed a society based on common ownership of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason. [ citation needed ] In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a Puritan religious group known as the " Diggers " advocated the abolition of private ownership of land. [ 14 ]  Eduard Bernstein , in his 1895 Cromwell and Communism [ 15 ] argued that several groupings in the English Civil War , especially the Diggers espoused clear communistic, agrarian ideals, and that Oliver Cromwell \'s attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile. [ 16 ] Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the Age of Enlightenment of the 18th century, through such thinkers as Jean Jacques Rousseau in France. [ citation needed ] Later, following the upheaval of the French Revolution , communism emerged as a political doctrine. [ 17 ]  Fran\xc3\xa7ois No\xc3\xabl Babeuf , in particular, espoused the goals of common ownership of land and total economic and political equality among citizens. [ citation needed ] \n Various social reformers in the early 19th century founded communities based on common ownership. But unlike many previous communist communities, they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis. [ 18 ] Notable among them were Robert Owen , who founded New Harmony in Indiana (1825), and Charles Fourier , whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as Brook Farm (1841\xe2\x80\x9347). [ 18 ] Later in the 19th century, Karl Marx described these social reformers as " utopian socialists " to contrast them with his program of " scientific socialism " (a term coined by Friedrich Engels ). Other writers described by Marx as "utopian socialists" included Saint-Simon . \n In its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement of 19th century Europe. As the Industrial Revolution advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the proletariat \xe2\x80\x94a new class of urban factory workers who laboured under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet The Communist Manifesto . [ 18 ] Engels, who lived in Manchester , observed the organization of the Chartist movement ( see History of British socialism ), while Marx departed from his university comrades to meet the proletariat in France and Germany.

(October 2011)  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Vladimir Lenin after his return to Petrograd . \n \n \n The 1917 October Revolution in Russia was the first time any avowedly Communist Party, in this case the Bolshevik Party , seized state power. The assumption of state power by the Bolsheviks generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. Russia, however, was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeois rule. [ 19 ] Other socialists also believed that a Russian revolution could be the precursor of workers\' revolutions in the West. \n The moderate Mensheviks opposed Lenin\'s Bolshevik plan for socialist revolution before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks\' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as "Peace, bread, and land" which tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the First World War , the peasants\' demand for land reform , and popular support for the Soviets . [ 20 ] \n The usage of the terms "communism" and "socialism" shifted after 1917, when the Bolsheviks changed their name to Communist Party and installed a single party regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies under Leninism . [ citation needed ] The Second International had dissolved in 1916 over national divisions, as the separate national parties that composed it did not maintain a unified front against the war , instead generally supporting their respective nation\'s role. Lenin thus created the Third International (Comintern) in 1919 and sent the Twenty-one Conditions , which included democratic centralism , to all European socialist parties willing to adhere. In France, for example, the majority of the French Section of the Workers\' International (SFIO) party split in 1921 to form the French Section of the Communist International (SFIC). [ citation needed ] Henceforth, the term "Communism" was applied to the objective of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern. Their program called for the uniting of workers of the world for revolution, which would be followed by the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat as well as the development of a socialist economy . Ultimately, if their program held, there would develop a harmonious classless society, with the withering away of the state . [ citation needed ] \n \n \n \n  \nSocialist countries led by governments which were nominally Marxist-Leninist in 1980. Color-coding indicates political alignment, with either the Soviet Union (red) or the People\'s Republic of China (yellow), or non-alignment (black). \n \n \n During the Russian Civil War (1918\xe2\x80\x931922), the Bolsheviks nationalized all productive property and imposed a policy of war communism , which put factories and railroads under strict government control, collected and rationed food, and introduced some bourgeois management of industry. After three years of war and the 1921 Kronstadt rebellion , Lenin declared the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, which was to give a "limited place for a limited time to capitalism." The NEP lasted until 1928, when Joseph Stalin achieved party leadership, and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan spelled the end of it. Following the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks, in 1922, formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), or Soviet Union, from the former Russian Empire . \n Following Lenin\'s democratic centralism, the communist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base; they were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to party discipline . [ 21 ] The Great Purge of 1937\xe2\x80\x931938 was Stalin\'s attempt to destroy any possible opposition within the Communist Party. In the Moscow Trials many old Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin\'s Soviet government afterwards, including Kamenev , Zinoviev , Rykov , and Bukharin , were accused, pleaded guilty, and executed. [ 22 ] \n Following World War II , Communists consolidated power in Central and Eastern Europe , and in 1949, the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Zedong , established the People\'s Republic of China , which would follow its own ideological path of Communist development following the Sino-Soviet split . Cuba , North Korea , Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia , Angola , and Mozambique were among the other countries in the Third World that adopted or imposed a Communist government at some point. By the early 1980s almost one-third of the world\'s population lived in Communist states , including the former Soviet Union and PRC. [ citation needed ] \n Communist states such as the Soviet Union and PRC succeeded in becoming industrial and technological powers, challenging the capitalists\' powers in the arms race and space race . \n Cold War \n \n \n \n  \nUSSR postage stamp depicting the communist state launching the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 . \n \n \n Main article: Cold War \n Main article: Red Scare \n Its leading role in the Second World War saw the emergence of the Soviet Union as a superpower, with strong influence over Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. At the same time the existing European empires were shattered and Communist parties played a leading role in many independence movements. \n Governments modelled on Soviet Communism took power with Soviet assistance in Bulgaria , Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Poland , Hungary and Romania . A Communist government was also created under Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia , but Tito\'s independent policies led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform , which had replaced the Comintern . Titoism , a new branch in the world Communist movement, was labelled " deviationist ". Albania also became an independent Communist nation after World War II. [ 23 ] \n By 1950, the Chinese Communists held all of Mainland China , thus controlling the most populous nation in the world. Other areas where rising Communist strength provoked dissension and in some cases led to actual fighting through conventional and guerrilla warfare include the Korean War , Laos , many nations of the Middle East and Africa , and notably succeeded in the case of the Vietnam War against the military power of the United States and its allies. With varying degrees of success, Communists attempted to unite with nationalist and socialist forces against what they saw as Western imperialism in these poor countries. \n \n \n \n  \nA 1947 propaganda book published by the Catechetical Guild Educational Society warning of the dangers of a communist revolution. \n \n \n Communism was seen as a rival, and a threat to western democracies and capitalism for most of the 20th century. [ 24 ] This rivalry peaked during the Cold War , as the world\'s two remaining superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, polarized most of the world into two camps of nations. This was characterized in the West as The Free World vs. Behind the Iron Curtain . [ citation needed ] It supported the spread of their respective economic and political systems (capitalism and communism) and strengthened their military powers. As a result, the camps developed new weapon systems, stockpiled nuclear weapons , and competed in space exploration. \n Near the beginning of the Cold War, on February 9, 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin accused 205 Americans working in the State Department of being " card-carrying communists ". [ 25 ] The fear of communism in the U.S. spurred McCarthyism , aggressive investigations and the red-baiting , blacklisting , jailing and deportation of persons suspected of following communist or other left-wing ideologies. Many famous actors and writers were placed on a blacklist from 1950 to 1954, which meant they would not be hired and would be subject to public disdain. [ 24 ] \n After the collapse of the Soviet Union \n Further information: List of communist parties &#160;and&#160; List of communist and anti-capitalist parties with parliamentary representation \n In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union and relaxed central control, in accordance with reform policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). The Soviet Union did not intervene as Poland , East Germany , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria , Romania , and Hungary all abandoned Communist rule by 1990. In 1991, the Soviet Union dissolved . \n By the beginning of the 21st century, states controlled by communist parties under a single-party system include the People\'s Republic of China , Cuba , Laos , Vietnam , and North Korea . Communist parties, or their descendant parties, remain politically important in a number of other countries. President Dimitris Christofias of Cyprus is a member of the Progressive Party of Working People , but the country is not run under single-party rule. The South African Communist Party is a partner in the African National Congress -led government. In India , communists lead the governments of three states , with a combined population of more than 115 million. In Nepal , communists hold a majority in the parliament . [ 26 ] The Communist Party of Brazil is a part of the parliamentary coalition led by the ruling democratic socialist Workers\' Party and is represented in the executive cabinet of Dilma Rousseff . \n \n \n \n  \nA tableau in a communist rally in Kerala , India , of a young farmer and worker. \n \n \n The People\'s Republic of China has reassessed many aspects of the Maoist legacy; it, along with Laos, Vietnam, and, to a lesser degree Cuba, has reduced state control of the economy in order to stimulate growth. Chinese economic reforms started in 1978 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping ; since then, China has managed to bring down the poverty rate from 53% in the Mao era to just 6% in 2001. [ 27 ] The People\'s Republic of China runs Special Economic Zones dedicated to market-oriented enterprise, free from central government control. Several other communist states have also attempted to implement market-based reforms, including Vietnam. \n \n \n \n  \nA demonstration of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation , Moscow, December 2011. \n \n \n Theories within Marxism as to why communism in Central and Eastern Europe was not achieved after socialist revolutions pointed to such elements as the pressure of external capitalist states, the relative backwardness of the societies in which the revolutions occurred, and the emergence of a bureaucratic stratum or class that arrested or diverted the transition process in its own interests. Marxist critics of the Soviet Union, most notably Trotsky, referred to the Soviet system , along with other Communist states, as " degenerated " or " deformed workers\' states ", arguing that the Soviet system fell far short of Marx\'s communist ideal and he claimed the working class was politically dispossessed. The ruling stratum of the Soviet Union was held to be a bureaucratic caste , but not a new ruling class , despite their political control. Anarchists who adhere to Participatory economics claim that the Soviet Union became dominated by powerful intellectual elites who in a capitalist system crown the proletariat\'s labour on behalf of the bourgeoisie.

Whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term social reform , Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable, and the only path to socialism and communism. \n According to the Marxist argument for communism, the main characteristic of human life in class society is alienation ; and communism is desirable because it entails the full realization of human freedom . [ 28 ] Marx here follows Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in conceiving freedom not merely as an absence of restraints but as action with content. [ 29 ] According to Marx, communism\'s outlook on freedom was based on an agent, obstacle, and goal. The agent is the common/working people; the obstacles are class divisions, economic inequalities, unequal life-chances , and false consciousness ; and the goal is the fulfilment of human needs including satisfying work, and fair share of the product. [ 30 ]  [ 31 ] \n They believed that communism allowed people to do what they want, but also put humans in such conditions and such relations with one another that they would not wish to exploit, or have any need to. Whereas for Hegel the unfolding of this ethical life in history is mainly driven by the realm of ideas, for Marx, communism emerged from material forces, particularly the development of the means of production . [ 29 ] \n Marxism holds that a process of class conflict and revolutionary struggle will result in victory for the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society in which private property and ownership is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. (Private property and ownership, in this context, means ownerships of the means of production , not private possessions). [ 32 ] Marx himself wrote little about life under communism, giving only the most general indication as to what constituted a communist society. It is clear that it entails abundance in which there is little limit to the projects that humans may undertake. [ citation needed ] In the popular slogan that was adopted by the communist movement , communism was a world in which each gave according to their abilities, and received according to their needs. The German Ideology (1845) was one of Marx\'s few writings to elaborate on the communist future: \n \n "In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic." \n \xe2\x80\x94 [ 33 ] \n \n Marx\'s lasting vision was to add this vision to a theory of how society was moving in a law-governed way towards communism, and, with some tension, a political theory that explained why revolutionary activity was required to bring it about. [ 29 ] \n In the late 19th century, the terms "socialism" and "communism" were often used interchangeably. However, Marx and Engels argued that communism would not emerge from capitalism in a fully developed state , but would pass through a "first phase" in which most productive property was owned in common, but with some class differences remaining. The "first phase" would eventually evolve into a "higher phase" in which class differences were eliminated, and a state was no longer needed. Lenin frequently used the term "socialism" to refer to Marx and Engels\' supposed "first phase" of communism and used the term "communism" interchangeably with Marx and Engels\' "higher phase" of communism. [ 34 ] \n These later aspects, particularly as developed by Vladimir Lenin, provided the underpinning for the mobilizing features of 20th century communist parties. \n Leninism and Marxism-Leninism \n Main articles: Leninism and Marxism-Leninism \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Core tenets \n \n \n \n Communism \n Vanguard party \n Democratic centralism \n Central planning \n Proletarian internationalism \n Marxist\xe2\x80\x92Leninist atheism \n Single-party state \n Socialist patriotism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Topics \n \n \n \n Marxism \n Leninism \n Stalinism \n \n \n Trotskyism \n Maoism \n Hoxhaism \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Khrushchevism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n People \n \n \n \n Karl Marx \n Vladimir Lenin \n \n \n Joseph Stalin \n Ernst Th\xc3\xa4lmann \n \n \n Earl Browder \n \n \n Gonchigiin Bumtsend \n \n \n Josip Broz Tito \n Fidel Castro \n \n \n Che Guevara \n Mao Zedong \n \n \n Deng Xiaoping \n Ho Chi Minh \n \n \n Enver Hoxha \n Mathieu K\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9kou \n \n \n Agostinho Neto \n Samora Machel \n \n \n Thomas Sankara \n Alfonso Cano \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Literature \n \n \n \n Wage Labour and Capital \n Materialism and Empirio-criticism \n Imperialism &#160;&#160; (Lenin) \n What Is to Be Done? \n The State and Revolution \n \n Dialectical and \nHistorical Materialism \n \n On Contradiction \n Guerrilla Warfare \n \n Fundamentals of \nMarxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n History \n \n \n \n Great October Socialist Revolution \n \n \n Soviet Union \n Comintern \n \n \n Hungarian Soviet Republic \n \n \n Spanish Civil War \n World War II \n \n \n Warsaw Pact \n Greek Civil War \n \n \n Chinese Revolution \n \n \n Korean War \n Cuban Revolution \n \n \n De-Stalinization \n \n \n Non-Aligned Movement \n \n \n Sino-Soviet split \n Vietnam War \n \n \n Portuguese Colonial War \n \n \n Nicaraguan Revolution \n \n \n Nepalese Civil War \n \n \n Naxalite-Maoist insurgency \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Related topics \n \n \n \n Bolshevism \n Leninism \n \n \n Maoism \n Marxism \n \n \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n \n \n Titoism \n Trotskyism \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Communism portal \n Politics portal \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n Leninism is the political movement developed by Vladimir Lenin , which has become the foundation for the organizational structure of most major communist parties. Leninists advocate the creation of a vanguard party led by dedicated revolutionaries in order to lead the working class revolution to victory. Leninists believe that socialism will not arise spontaneously through the natural decay of capitalism and that workers are unable to organize and develop socialist consciousness without the guidance of the Vanguard party. After taking power, Vanguard parties seek to create a socialist state continually led by the Vanguard party in order to direct social development and defend against counterrevolutionary insurrection. The mode of industrial organization championed by Leninism and Marxism-Leninism is the capitalist model of scientific management pioneered by Fredrick Taylor . [ citation needed ] \n Marxism-Leninism is a version of Leninism merged with classical Marxism adopted by the Soviet Union and most communist parties across the world today. It shaped the Soviet Union and influenced communist parties worldwide. It was heralded as a possibility of building communism via a massive program of industrialization and collectivisation . Despite the fall of the Soviet Union and the \'Eastern Bloc\' (meaning communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe), many communist parties of the world today still lay claim to uphold the Marxist-Leninist banner. Marxism-Leninism expands on Marxist thoughts by bringing the theories to what Lenin and other Communists considered, the age of capitalist imperialism, and a renewed focus on party building, the development of a socialist state , and democratic centralism as an organisational principle. \n Lenin\'s pamphlet What is to be Done? (1902), proposed that the (urban) proletariat can successfully achieve revolutionary consciousness only under the leadership of a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries \xe2\x80\x94who can achieve aims only with internal democratic centralism in the party; tactical and ideological policy decisions are agreed via democracy, and every member must support and promote the agreed party policy. \n To wit, capitalism can be overthrown only with revolution\xe2\x80\x94because attempts to reform capitalism from within ( Fabianism ) and from without ( social democracy ) will fail because of its inherent contradictions. The purpose of a Leninist revolutionary vanguard party is the forceful deposition of the incumbent government; assume power (as agent of the proletariat) and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat . Moreover, as the government, the vanguard party must educate the proletariat\xe2\x80\x94to dispel the societal false consciousness of religion and nationalism that are culturally instilled by the bourgeoisie in facilitating exploitation, and to instil the material scientific outlook of the world and the sense of proletarian internationalism . The dictatorship of the proletariat is governed with a de-centralized direct democracy practised via soviets (councils) where the workers exercise political power (cf. soviet democracy ); the fifth chapter of State &amp; Revolution , describes it: \n \n ".... the dictatorship of the proletariat\xe2\x80\x94i.e. the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. An immense expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich:&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people\xe2\x80\x94this is the change which democracy undergoes during the transition from capitalism to communism." \n \xe2\x80\x94 [ 35 ] \n \n The post- revolutionary Bolshevik government was hostile to nationalism, especially to Russian nationalism , the "Great Russian chauvinism", which was seen as an obstacle to establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. [ 36 ] However, under the regime of Joseph Stalin , during the Great Patriotic War , Russian nationalism brought back into favour. [ 37 ] \n The hallmarks of Marxism-Leninism are: the revolutionary vanguard party, revolution as a means to overthrow capitalism , and democratic centralism. \n Leninism \n Main article: Leninism \n \n \n \n  \nVladimir Lenin, 1921 \n \n \n \n "We want to achieve a new and better order of society: in this new and better society there must be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work. Not a handful of rich people, but all the working people must enjoy the fruits of their common labour. Machines and other improvements must serve to ease the work of all and not to enable a few to grow rich at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people. This new and better society is called socialist society . The teachings about this society are called \'socialism\'.\xe2\x80\x9c \n -Vladimir Lenin, "To the Rural Poor" (1903) ; Collected Works , Vol 6, p. 366 \n \n Leninism is the revolutionary theories developed by Vladimir Lenin , including the organizational principles of democratic centralism , Vanguardism and the political theory of imperialism. Leninist theory postulates that, with the strongly determined will of the Bourgeoisie to establish Imperialism , socialism will not arise spontaneously through the natural decay of capitalism, and that workers by themselves, who may be more or less sedated by reactionary propaganda, are unable to effectively organise and develop socialist consciousness , therefore requiring the leadership of a revolutionary vanguard organized on the basis of democratic centralism . As a result, Leninism promotes a Vanguard party in order to lead the working-class and peasants in a revolution. Because this revolution takes place in underdeveloped, largely pre-capitalist countries such as Russia, Leninism establishes a single-party, authoritarian state, justifying single-party control over the state and economy as a means to safeguard the revolution against counter-revolutionary insurrection and foreign invasion. [ 38 ] \n Although the creation of a vanguard party was outlined by Marx and Engels in Chapter II: "Proletarians and Communists" of The Communist Manifesto , Lenin modified this position by changing the role of the vanguards to professional revolutionaries , who were to hold power post-revolution and direct the national economy and society in developing world socialism. \n After disposing of the Bourgeois dictatorship through socialist revolution , Leninists seek to create a socialist state in which the working class would be in power, which they see as being essential for laying the foundations for a transitional withering of the state towards communism (Stateless society). In this state, the vanguard party would act as a central nucleus in the organisation of socialist society, presiding over a single-party political system. Leninism rejects political pluralism , seeing it as divisive and destructive. Instead, Leninism advocates the concept of democratic centralism as a process to ensure the voicing of concern and disagreement and to refine policy. Generally, the purpose of democratic centralism is "diversity in ideas, unity in action." \n Leninist revolutionary theory alongside Marxist economic theory forms the ideology of Marxism-Leninism . After Lenin\'s death in 1924, Leninism branched into multiple (sometimes opposing) interpretations, including Trotskyism , Stalinism , and Maoism . \n \n "Socialist dreams turned into the socialist struggle of millions only when Marx\'s scientific socialism had linked up the urge for change with the struggle of a definite class. Outside the class struggle, socialism is either a hollow phrase or a naive dream." \n \xe2\x80\x94 Vladimir Lenin [ 39 ]  \n \n Stalinism \n Main article: Stalinism \n \n \n \n  \n Joseph Stalin \n \n \n Stalinism was the political system of the Soviet Union and the countries within the Soviet sphere of influence during the leadership of Joseph Stalin . The term usually defines the style of a government rather than an ideology. The ideology was officially Marxism-Leninism theory, reflecting that Stalin himself was not a theoretician, in contrast to Marx and Lenin, and prided himself on maintaining the legacy of Lenin as a founding father for the Soviet Union and the future Socialist world. Stalinism is an interpretation of their ideas, and a certain political regime claiming to apply those ideas in ways fitting the changing needs of Soviet society, as with the transition from "socialism at a snail\'s pace" in the mid-twenties to the rapid industrialization of the Five-Year Plans . \n The main contributions of Stalin to communist theory were: \n \n The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities, laid in Stalin\'s 1913 work Marxism and the National Question , [ 40 ] praised by Lenin. \n Socialism in One Country , stating that communists should attain socialism in their own country as a prelude to internationalising. \n The theory of aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism , a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. \n \n The legitimacy of Stalin\'s claim to the role of leadership in the Soviet Union (and thus the international communist movement as a whole) is a matter of some debate. Advocates of Stalinism cite both Lenin\'s praising of the early works of Stalin and the economic successes of the Five-Year Plans. Opponents, however, point out that certain aspects of Stalinism (socialism in one country, " revolutionary patriotism ", etc.) are not found in Leninism, and argue that some aspects are even contradictory to Marxism-Leninism. Also, in Lenin\'s Testament , a document written by Vladimir Lenin in the last weeks of 1922 and the first week of 1923 outlining his proposed changes to the structure of the Soviet governing bodies, Lenin suggested "that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from [the Secretary-General] post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc." Both sides of this debate identify as being ideologically orthodox to Leninism and criticise the other as being " revisionist ." \n Trotskyism \n Main article: Trotskyism \n \n \n \n  \n Leon Trotsky reading The Militant . \n \n \n Trotskyism is the branch of Marxism that was developed by Leon Trotsky . It supports the theory of permanent revolution and world revolution instead of the two stage theory and socialism in one country . It supported proletarian internationalism and another Communist revolution in the Soviet Union, which, under the leadership of Stalin, Trotsky claimed had become a degenerated worker\'s state , rather than the dictatorship of the proletariat , in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form. \n Trotsky and his supporters organized into the Left Opposition and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky\'s exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. Trotsky later founded the Fourth International , a Trotskyist rival to the Comintern , in 1938. \n Trotskyist ideas have continually found a modest echo among political movements in some countries in Latin America and Asia , especially in Argentina , Brazil , Bolivia and Sri Lanka . Many Trotskyist organizations are also active in more stable, developed countries in North America and Western Europe . Trotsky\'s politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution (rather than socialism in one country) and unwavering support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles. \n However, as a whole, Trotsky\'s theories and attitudes were never accepted in worldwide mainstream Communist circles after Trotsky\'s expulsion, either within or outside the Soviet bloc . This remained the case even after the Secret Speech and subsequent events which critics claim exposed the fallibility of Stalin. \n Maoism \n Main article: Maoism \n \n \n Part of a series on \n \n \n Maoism \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Basic concepts \n \n \n \n Marxism-Leninism \n Stalinism \n Anti-Revisionism \n Three Worlds Theory \n Social-imperialism \n Mass line \n People\'s war \n Cultural Revolution \n New Democracy \n Agrarian socialism \n People\'s democratic dictatorship \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Prominent Maoists \n \n Mao Zedong \n \n Chen Boda \n Abimael Guzm\xc3\xa1n \n \xc4\xb0brahim Kaypakkaya \n Lin Biao \n Charu Majumdar \n Siraj Sikder \n Pierre Mulele \n Huey P.

Nikita Khrushchev \'s reforms heightened ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, which became increasingly apparent in the 1960s. Parties and groups that supported the Communist Party of China (CPC) in their criticism against the new Soviet leadership proclaimed themselves as \'anti-revisionist\' and denounced the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the parties aligned with it as revisionist "capitalist-roaders." The Sino-Soviet Split resulted in divisions amongst communist parties around the world. Notably, the Party of Labour of Albania sided with the People\'s Republic of China . Effectively, the CPC under Mao\'s leadership became the rallying forces of a parallel international Communist tendency. \n Definitions of Maoism vary. Within the Chinese context, Maoism can refer to Mao\'s belief in the mobilization of the masses, particularly in large-scale political movements; it can also refer to the egalitarianism that was seen during Mao\'s era as opposed to the free-market ideology of Deng Xiaoping ; some scholars additionally define personality cults and political sloganeering as "Maoist" practices. Contemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by a capitalist and \'revisionist\' Communist party. \n \n \n \n \n  \n Prachanda , giving a speech at Pokhara , Nepal. \n \n \n Prachanda Path \n See also: Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism\xe2\x80\x93Maoism\xe2\x80\x93Prachanda Path \n Prachanda Path refers to the ideological line of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal . This thought is an extension of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism, totally based on home-ground politics of Nepal . The doctrine came into existence after it was realized that the ideology of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism could not be practiced completely as it was done in the past. And an ideology suitable, based on the ground reality of Nepalese politics was adopted by the party. \n Hoxhaism \n Main article: Hoxhaism \n Another variant of anti-revisionist Marxism-Leninism appeared after the ideological row between the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labour of Albania in 1978. The Albanians rallied a new separate international tendency, which would demarcate itself by a strict defence of the legacy of Joseph Stalin and fierce criticism of virtually all other Communist groupings as revisionism . Critical of the United States , the Soviet Union, and China, Enver Hoxha declared the latter two to be social-imperialist and condemned the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia by withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact in response. Hoxha declared Albania to be the world\'s only Marxist-Leninist state after 1978. The Albanians were able to win over a large share of the Maoists, mainly in Latin America such as the Popular Liberation Army , but also had a significant international following in general. This tendency has occasionally been labelled as \'Hoxhaism\' after him. \n After the fall of the Communist government in Albania, the pro-Albanian parties are grouped around an international conference and the publication \'Unity and Struggle\'. \n Titoism \n Main article: Titoism \n Elements of Titoism are characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country, the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, rather than by a pattern set in another country. During Tito\'s era, this specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of (and often in opposition to) the policies of the Soviet Union. The term was originally meant as a pejorative , and was labelled by Moscow as a heresy during the period of tensions between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia known as the Informbiro period from 1948 to 1955. \n Unlike the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, which fell under Stalin\'s influence post\xe2\x80\x93World War II, Yugoslavia , due to the strong leadership of Marshal Josip Broz Tito and the fact that the Yugoslav Partisans liberated Yugoslavia with only limited help from the Red Army , remained independent from Moscow. It became the only country in the Balkans to resist pressure from Moscow to join the Warsaw Pact and remained "socialist, but independent" until the collapse of Soviet socialism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Throughout his time in office, Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia\'s independence from Russia, with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership of the Comecon and Tito\'s open rejection of many aspects of Stalinism as the most obvious manifestations of this. \n Juche \n Main article: Juche \n Juche is a development of Marxism-Leninism which is the official ideology of North Korea and developed under its leader Kim Il Sung . It emphasises economic and military self-reliance. As the Communist bloc split, collapsed, or embraced market reforms, Juche was increasingly emphasised by the North Korean regime over the wider theories of Communism. \n Eurocommunism \n Main article: Eurocommunism \n Eurocommunism was a trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various Western European communist parties to develop a theory and practice of social transformation that was more relevant in a Western European democracy and less aligned to the influence or control of the Soviet Union. Parties such as the Italian Communist Party (PCI), the French Communist Party (PCF), and the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), were politically active and electorally significant in their respective countries. [ citation needed ] \n The main theoretical foundation of Eurocommunism was Antonio Gramsci \'s writing about Marxist theory which questioned the sectarianism of the Left and encouraged communist parties to develop social alliances to win hegemonic support for social reforms. Eurocommunist parties expressed their fidelity to democratic institutions more clearly than before and attempted to widen their appeal by embracing public sector middle-class workers, new social movements such as feminism and gay liberation and more publicly questioning the Soviet Union. Early inspirations can also be found in the Austromarxism and its seeking of a "third" democratic "way" to socialism. \n Libertarian Marxism \n Main article: Libertarian Marxism \n Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism . Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism , [ 41 ] emerged in opposition to Marxism\xe2\x80\x93Leninism [ 42 ] and its derivatives, such as Stalinism , Maoism , and Trotskyism . [ 43 ] Libertarian Marxism is also critical of reformist positions, such as those held by social democrats . [ 44 ] Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels\' later works, specifically the Grundrisse and The Civil War in France ; [ 45 ] emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation. [ 46 ] Along with anarchism , Libertarian Marxism is one of the main currents of libertarian socialism . [ 47 ] \n Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as Luxemburgism , council communism , left communism , Socialisme ou Barbarie , the Johnson-Forest tendency , world socialism , Lettrism / Situationism and operaismo / autonomism , and New Left . [ 48 ] Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both post-left and social anarchists . Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included Anton Pannekoek , Raya Dunayevskaya , CLR James , Antonio Negri , Cornelius Castoriadis , Maurice Brinton , Guy Debord , Daniel Gu\xc3\xa9rin , Ernesto Screpanti and Raoul Vaneigem . \n Council Communism \n Main article: Council communism \n Council communism is a far-left movement originating in Germany and the Netherlands in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left-wing Marxism and libertarian socialism . \n The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of social democracy and Leninist Communism, is that democratic workers\' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organisation and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the reformist and the Leninist ideologies , with their stress on, respectively, parliaments and institutional government (i.e., by applying social reforms, on the one hand, and vanguard parties and participative democratic centralism on the other). \n The core principle of council communism is that the government and the economy should be managed by workers\' councils composed of delegates elected at workplaces and recallable at any moment. As such, council communists oppose state-run authoritarian " State socialism "/" State capitalism ". They also oppose the idea of a "revolutionary party", since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker\'s democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers\' councils. \n \n \n \n  \n Rosa Luxemburg , prominent left communist critic of Leninism \n \n \n Left Communism \n Main article: Left communism \n Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first and during its second congress. \n Left Communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as \'left of capital\', not socialists), anarchist communists (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example De Leonists , who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances). \n Although she died before left communism became a distinct tendency, Rosa Luxemburg has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included Amadeo Bordiga , Herman Gorter , Anton Pannekoek , Otto R\xc3\xbchle , Karl Korsch , Sylvia Pankhurst and Paul Mattick . \n Prominent left communist groups existing today include the International Communist Party , the International Communist Current and the Internationalist Communist Tendency . \n Situationism \n Main article: Situationist International \n The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented general wildcat strikes of May 1968 in France . \n With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic avant-gardes , they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the capitalist order , for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the construction of situations , namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like unitary urbanism and psychogeography . \n They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in advanced capitalism . Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord . Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like mass media and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts, and asked the workers to occupy the factories and to run them with direct democracy , through workers\' councils composed by instantly revocable delegates. \n After publishing in the last issue of the magazine an analysis of the May 1968 revolts, and the strategies that will need to be adopted in future revolutions, [ 49 ] the SI was dissolved in 1972. [ 50 ] \n Autonomism \n Main article: Autonomism \n \n \n \n  \n Antonio Negri , main theorist of Italian autonomism \n \n \n Autonomism refers to a set of left-wing political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in Italy in the 1960s from workerist ( operaismo ) communism. Later, post-Marxist and anarchist tendencies became significant after influence from the Situationists , the failure of Italian far-left movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including Antonio Negri , who had contributed to the 1969 founding of Potere Operaio , Mario Tronti, Paolo Virno , etc. \n Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the Johnson-Forest Tendency and in France by the group Socialisme ou Barbarie . \n It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide Social Centre movement , and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to post-structuralists and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and Autonomen movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as Autonomists . The Italian operaismo movement also influenced Marxist academics such as Harry Cleaver , John Holloway , Steve Wright, and Nick Dyer-Witheford. \n \n Non-Marxist Communism \n The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as Christian communism and anarchist communism ) also exist. \n Anarchist Communism \n Main article: Anarchist communism \n \n \n \n  \n Peter Kropotkin , main theorist of anarcho-communism \n \n \n Anarchist communism (also known as libertarian communism) is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state , private property , and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production , [ 51 ]  [ 52 ]  direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: " from each according to his ability, to each according to his need ". [ 53 ]  [ 54 ] \n Anarcho-communism differs from Marxism rejecting its view about the need for a State Socialism phase before building communism. The main anarcho-communist theorist Peter Kropotkin argued "that a revolutionary society should \xe2\x80\x9ctransform itself immediately into a communist society,\xe2\x80\x9d, that is, should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the \xe2\x80\x9cmore advanced,\xe2\x80\x9d completed, phase of communism." [ 55 ] In this way it tries to avoid the reappearence of "class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything". [ 55 ] \n Some forms of anarchist communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are egoist and strongly influenced by radical individualism , [ 56 ]  [ 57 ]  [ 58 ] believing that anarchist communism does not require a communitarian nature at all. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society [ 59 ]  [ 60 ]  [ 61 ] \n To date in human history, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society, established around the ideas as they exist today, that received worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon, are the anarchist territories during the Spanish Revolution and the Free Territory during the Russian Revolution . Through the efforts and influence of the Spanish Anarchists during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War , starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon , parts of the Levante and Andalusia , as well as in the stronghold of Anarchist Catalonia before being brutally crushed by the combined forces of the authoritarian regime that won the war , Hitler , Mussolini , Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend\xe2\x80\x94through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine \xe2\x80\x94anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921. \n Christian Communism \n Christian communism is a form of religious communism centred on Christianity . It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the teachings of Jesus Christ urge Christians to support communism as the ideal social system . Christian communists trace the origins of their practice to teachings in the New Testament , such as the Acts of the Apostles at chapter 2 and verses 42, 44 and 45: \n \n 42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles\' doctrine and in fellowship ... 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things in common; 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. \n \xe2\x80\x94 King James Version \n \n Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of Christian socialism . Also, because many Christian communists have formed independent stateless communes in the past, there is a link between Christian communism and Christian anarchism . Christian communists may not agree with various parts of Marxism , but they share some of the political goals of Marxists, for example replacing capitalism with socialism , which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future. However, Christian communists sometimes disagree with Marxists (and particularly with Leninists ) on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized. \n Criticism \n Main articles: Criticisms of communism , Anti-communism , and Mass killings under Communist regimes \n See also Criticisms of Marxism and Criticisms of socialism for a discussion of objections to socialism in general. \n \n \n \n  \nThe government\'s forced collectivization of agriculture is considered a main reason for the Soviet famine of 1932\xe2\x80\x931933 . \n \n \n Some people have criticised socialism and by extension communism, stating that the two systems have distorted or absent price signals , [ 62 ]  [ 63 ] slow or stagnant technological advance, [ 64 ] reduced incentives, [ 65 ]  [ 66 ]  [ 67 ] and reduced prosperity, [ 68 ]  [ 69 ] as well as on the grounds of its feasibility [ 62 ]  [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] and its social and political effects. [ 70 ]  [ 71 ]  [ 72 ]  [ 73 ]  [ 74 ]  [ 75 ] \n Part of this criticism extends to the policies adopted by one-party states ruled by communist parties (known as " communist states "). Some scholars are specially focused on their human rights records which are claimed to be responsible for famines, purges and warfare resulting in deaths far in excess of previous empires, capitalist or other regimes. [ 76 ]  [ 77 ]  [ 78 ] \n The Council of Europe in Resolution 1481 and international declarations such as the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism and the Declaration on Crimes of Communism have condemned some of the actions that resulted in these deaths as crimes. \n St\xc3\xa9phane Courtois argues that communism is responsible for the murder of almost 100 million people in the 20th century, [ 79 ] but two of the main Black Book\' s contributors, Nicolas Werth and Jean-Louis Margolin, disagreed and publicly disassociated themselves from Courtois\'s statements. [ 80 ] \n See also \n \n List of communist parties \n \n References \n Notes \n \n \n ^  Principals of Communism , Frederick Engels, 1847, Section 18. "Finally, when all capital, all production, all exchange have been brought together in the hands of the nation, private property will disappear of its own accord, money will become superfluous, and production will so expand and man so change that society will be able to slough off whatever of its old economic habits may remain." \n ^  The ABC of Communism , Nikoli Bukharin, 1920, Section 20 \n ^  See for example, Socialism: Utopian or Scientific by Friedrich Engels, chapter III, paragraph III: "The proletariat seizes the public power, and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production, slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie, into public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out. Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master \xe2\x80\x94 free." or the ABC of Communism : "In a communist society there will be no classes. But if there will be no classes, this implies that in communist society there will likewise be no State." \n ^  communism . CollinsDictionary.com.

The economy was characterised by state control of investment, public ownership of industrial assets, and during the last 20 years of its existence, pervasive corruption and socioeconomic stagnation. \n After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power, continuing economic liberalisation moved the economy towards a market-oriented socialist economy . All of these factors contributed to the final dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The stagnation that would consume the last years of the Soviet Union was caused by poor governance under Leonid Brezhnev and inefficiencies within the planned economy . When the stagnation began is a matter of debate, but is normally placed either in the 1960s or early 1970s. \n Beginning in 1928, the entire course of the economy was guided by a series of Five-Year Plans . By the 1950s, the Soviet Union had, during the preceding few decades, evolved from a mainly agrarian society into a major industrial power. [ 14 ] Its transformative capacity\xe2\x80\x94what the United States National Security Council described as a "proven ability to carry backward countries speedily through the crisis of modernization and industrialization"\xe2\x80\x94meant communism consistently appealed to the intellectuals of developing countries in Asia. [ 15 ] Impressive growth rates during the first three Five-Year Plans (1928\xe2\x80\x9340) are particularly notable given that this period is nearly congruent with the Great Depression. [ 16 ] Nevertheless, the impoverished base upon which the Five-Year Plans sought to build meant that, at the commencement of Operation Barbarossa , the country was still poor. [ 17 ] While legitimate strictly in terms of growth and industrialisation, the death toll attributable to Stalinist economic development has been estimated at 10 million, much of which comprises famine victims . [ 18 ] \n The complex demands of the modern economy and inflexible administration overwhelmed and constrained the central planners. Corruption and data fiddling became common practice among the bureaucracy by reporting fulfilled targets and quotas, thus entrenching the crisis. Nonetheless, from the Stalin-era to the early Brezhnev-era, the Soviet economy grew much slower than Japan and slightly faster than the U.S. GDP levels in 1950 (in billion 1990 dollars) were 510 (100%) in the USSR, 161 (100%) in Japan and 1456 (100%) in the US. By 1965 the corresponding values were 1011 (198%), 587 (365%), and 2607 (179%). [ 19 ] \n The USSR\'s relatively small service sector accounted for just under 60% of the country\'s GDP in 1990, while the industrial and agricultural sectors contributed 21.9% and 20% respectively in 1991. Agriculture was the predominant occupation in the USSR before the massive industrialization under Joseph Stalin . The service sector was of low importance in the USSR, with the majority of the labor force employed in the industrial sector . The labor force totaled 152.3 million people. Major industrial products included petroleum, steel, motor vehicles, aerospace, telecommunications, chemicals, electronics, food processing, lumber, mining, and defense industry. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Planning \n \n 1.1 Drafting the five-year plans \n \n 1.1.1 Time frame \n 1.1.2 Guidelines for the plan \n 1.1.3 Gosplan \n 1.1.4 Planning ministries \n 1.1.5 Enterprises \n 1.1.6 Redrafting the plan \n 1.1.7 Approval of the plan \n 1.1.8 State budget \n \n \n \n \n 2 Agriculture \n 3 Foreign trade and currency \n 4 Forms of property \n \n 4.1 Individual property \n 4.2 Collective property \n \n \n 5 History \n \n 5.1 Early development \n 5.2 New Economic Policy (1921\xe2\x80\x939) \n 5.3 Stalinism \n 5.4 1930\xe2\x80\x931970 \n 5.5 1970\xe2\x80\x931990 \n \n \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n 8 Further reading \n \n 8.1 in Russian \n \n \n 9 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Planning \n Based on a system of state ownership, the Soviet economy was managed through Gosplan (the State Planning Commission), Gosbank (the State Bank) and the Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply). Beginning in 1928, the economy was directed by a series of five-year plans , with a brief attempt at seven-year planning. For every enterprise, planning ministries (also known as the "fund holders" or fondoderzhateli ) defined the mix of economic inputs (e.g., labor and raw materials), a schedule for completion, all wholesale prices and almost all retail prices . The planning process was based around material balances - balancing economic inputs with planned output targets for the planning period. Although nominally a "centrally-planned" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process [ citation needed ] . \n Industry was long concentrated after 1928 on the production of capital goods through metallurgy , machine manufacture, and chemical industry. In Soviet terminology, the capital goods were known as group A goods , or means of production . This emphasis was based on the perceived necessity for a very fast industrialization and modernization of the Soviet Union. After the death of Stalin in 1953, consumer goods ( group B goods ) received more emphasis [ citation needed ] . For further details see consumer goods in the Soviet Union . \n Most information in the Soviet economy flowed from the top down. There were several mechanisms in place for producers and consumers to provide input and information that would help in the drafting of economic plans (as detailed below), but the political climate was such that few people ever provided negative input or criticism of the plan [ citation needed ] . Thus, Soviet planners had very little reliable feedback that they could use to determine the success of their plans. This meant that economic planning was often done based on faulty or outdated information, particularly in sectors with large numbers of consumers. As a result, some goods tended to be underproduced, leading to shortages ( defitsit , \xd0\xb4\xd0\xb5\xd1\x84\xd0\xb8\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82), while other goods were overproduced and accumulated in storage. Low-level managers often did not report such problems to their superiors, relying instead on each other for support. Some factories developed a system of barter and either exchanged or shared raw materials and parts without the knowledge of the authorities and outside the parameters of the economic plan [ citation needed ] . \n Heavy industry was always the focus of the Soviet economy, even in its later years. The fact that it received special attention from the planners, combined with the fact that industrial production was relatively easy to plan even without minute feedback, led to significant growth in that sector. The Soviet Union became one of the leading industrial nations of the world. Industrial production was disproportionately high in the Soviet Union compared to Western economies. However, the production of consumer goods was disproportionately low. Economic planners made little effort to determine the wishes of household consumers, resulting in severe shortages of many consumer goods. Whenever these consumer goods would become available on the market, consumers routinely had to stand in long lines (queues) to buy them. [ citation needed ] A black market developed for goods that were particularly sought after but constantly underproduced (such as cigarettes ). \n \n See also : Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning . \n \n [ edit ] Drafting the five-year plans \n Under Stalin \'s tutelage, a complex system of planning arrangements had developed since the introduction of the first five-year plan in 1928. Until the late-1980s and early-1990s, when economic reforms backed by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced significant changes in the traditional system ( see Perestroika ), the allocation of resources was directed by a planning apparatus rather than through the interplay of market forces. \n [ edit ] Time frame \n From the Joseph Stalin era through the late 1980s, the five-year plan integrated short-range planning into a longer time frame. It delineated the chief thrust of the country\'s economic development and specified the way the economy could meet the desired goals of the Communist Party . Although the five-year plan was enacted into law, it contained a series of guidelines rather than a set of direct orders. \n Periods covered by the five-year plans coincided with those covered by the gatherings of the CPSU Party Congress . At each CPSU Congress, the party leadership presented the targets for the next five-year plan. Thus, each plan had the approval of the most authoritative body of the country\'s leading political institution. \n [ edit ] Guidelines for the plan \n The Central Committee of the CPSU and, more specifically, its Politburo , set basic guidelines for planning. The Politburo determined the general direction of the economy via control figures (preliminary plan targets), major investment projects (capacity creation), and general economic policies. These guidelines were submitted as a report of the Central Committee to the Congress of the CPSU to be approved there. \n After the approval at the congress, the list of priorities for the five-year plan was processed by the Council of Ministers , which constituted the government of the USSR. The Council of Ministers was composed of industrial ministers, chairmen of various state committees, and chairmen of agencies with ministerial status. This committee stood at the apex of the vast economic administration, including the state planning apparatus, the industrial ministries, the trusts (the intermediate level between the ministries and the enterprises), and finally, the state enterprises. The Council of Ministers elaborated on Politburo plan targets and sent them to Gosplan, which gathered data on plan fulfillment. \n [ edit ] Gosplan \n Main article: Gosplan \n Combining the broad goals laid out by the Council of Ministers with data supplied by lower administrative levels regarding the current state of the economy, Gosplan worked out, through trial and error, a set of preliminary plan targets. Among more than twenty state committees, Gosplan headed the government\'s planning apparatus and was by far the most important agency in the economic administration. The task of planners was to balance resources and requirements to ensure that the necessary inputs were provided for the planned output. The planning apparatus alone was a vast organizational arrangement consisting of councils, commissions, governmental officials, specialists, etc. charged with executing and monitoring economic policy. \n The state planning agency was subdivided into its own industrial departments, such as coal , iron , and machine building. It also had summary departments such as finance , dealing with issues that crossed functional boundaries. With the exception of a brief experiment with regional planning during the Khrushchev era in the 1950s, Soviet planning was done on a sectoral basis rather than on a regional basis. The departments of the state planning agency aided the agency\'s development of a full set of plan targets along with input requirements, a process involving bargaining between the ministries and their superiors. \n [ edit ] Planning ministries \n Economic ministries performed key roles in the Soviet organizational structure. When the planning goals had been established by Gosplan , economic ministries drafted plans within their jurisdictions and disseminated planning data to the subordinate enterprises. The planning data were sent downward through the planning hierarchy for progressively more detailed elaboration. The ministry received its control targets, which were then disaggregated by branches within the ministry, then by lower units, eventually until each enterprise received its own control figures (production targets). \n [ edit ] Enterprises \n Enterprises were called upon to develop in the final period of state planning in the late-1980s and early-1990s (even though such participation was mostly limited to a rubber-stamping of prepared statements during huge pre-staged meetings). The enterprises\' draft plans were then sent back up through the planning ministries for review. This process entailed intensive bargaining, with all parties seeking the target levels and input figures that best suited their interests. \n [ edit ] Redrafting the plan \n After this bargaining process, Gosplan received the revised estimates and re-aggregated them as it saw fit. Then, the redrafted plan was sent to the Council of Ministers and the Party\'s Politburo and Central Committee Secretariat for approval. The Council of Ministers submitted the Plan to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee submitted the plan to the Party Congress, both for rubber stamp approval. By this time, the process had been completed and the plan became law. \n [ edit ] Approval of the plan \n The review, revision, and approval of the five-year plan were followed by another downward flow of information, this time with the amended and final plans containing the specific targets for each sector of the economy. Implementation began at this point, and was largely the responsibility of enterprise managers. \n [ edit ] State budget \n The national state budget was prepared by the Ministry of Finance of the USSR by negotiating with its all-Union local organizations. If the state budget was accepted by the Soviet Union , to then get adopted. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Agriculture \n Main article: Agriculture in the Soviet Union \n Agriculture was organized into a system of collective farms ( kolkhozes ) and state farms ( sovkhozes ). Organized on a large scale and highly mechanized, the Soviet Union was one of the world\'s leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976-1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a record harvest followed by another drop in overall production in 1979 and 1980 back to levels attained in 1975. Cotton , sugar beets , potatoes , and flax were also major crops. \n However, despite immense land resources, extensive machinery and chemical industries, and a large rural work force, Soviet agriculture was relatively unproductive, [ original research? ] hampered in many areas by the climate (only 10 percent of the Soviet Union\'s land was arable), and poor worker productivity since the collectivization in the 1930s. [ citation needed ] Lack of transport infrastructure also caused much waste. \n A view of poor performance of Soviet collective farms is provided by two historians, M. Heller and A. Nekich ("Utopia in Power, History of the Soviet Union from 1917 to Present," Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., 1986). The authors report that in 1979, 28% of the Soviet agricultural production was from small plots of private citizens, which represented less than 1% of the cultivated land. So according to them, collective farms operated very inefficiently. \n [ edit ] Foreign trade and currency \n Main article: Foreign trade of the Soviet Union \n Largely self-sufficient, the Soviet Union traded little in comparison to its economic strength. However, trade with noncommunist countries increased in the 1970s as the government sought to compensate gaps in domestic production with imports. \n In general, fuels , metals , and timber were exported. Machinery , consumer goods , and sometimes grain were imported. In the 1980s trade with the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) member states accounted for about half the country\'s volume of trade. Although often associated with alcohol production, such as that of vodka , none of these were leading Soviet exports. \n The Soviet currency (ruble) was non-convertible after 1932 (when trade in gold-convertible " chervonets ", introduced by Lenin in NEP years, was suspended) until the late eighties. It was impossible (both for citizens and state-owned businesses) to freely buy or sell foreign currency even though the "exchange rate" was set and published regularly. Buying or selling foreign currency on a black market was a serious crime until the late eighties. Individuals who were paid from abroad (for example writers whose books were published abroad) normally had to spend their currency in a foreign-currency-only chain of state-owned " Beryozka " ("Birch-tree") stores. Once a free conversion of currency was allowed, the exchange rate plummeted from its official values by almost a factor of 10. \n Overall, the banking system was highly centralized and fully controlled by a single state-owned Gosbank , responsive to the fulfillment of the government\'s economic plans. Soviet banks furnished short-term credit to state-owned enterprises. \n [ edit ] Forms of property \n There were two basic forms of property in the Soviet Union: individual property and collective property. These differed greatly in their content and legal status. According to communist theory, capital ( means of production ) should not be individually owned, with certain negligible exceptions. In particular, after the end of a short period of the New Economic Policy and with collectivization completed, all industrial property and virtually all land were collective. \n Land in rural areas was allotted for housing and some sustenance farming, and persons had certain rights to it, but it was not their property in full. In particular, in kolkhozes and sovkhozes there was a practice to rotate individual farming lots with collective lots. This resulted in situations where people would ameliorate , till and cultivate their lots carefully, adapting them to small-scale farming, and in 5\xe2\x80\x937 years those lots would be swapped for kolkhoz ones, typically with exhausted soil due to intensive, large-scale agriculture. There was an extremely small number of remaining individual farmsteads ( khutors \xd1\x85\xd1\x83\xd1\x82\xd0\xbe\xd1\x80), located in isolated rural areas in the Baltic states , Ukraine , Siberia and cossack lands. \n [ edit ] Individual property \n To distinguish "capitalist" and "socialist" types of property ownership further, two different forms of individual property were recognized: private property ( \xd1\x87\xd0\xb0\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , chastnaya sobstvennost) and personal property ( \xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x87\xd0\xbd\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd1\x81\xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbd\xd0\xbe\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd1\x8c , lichnaya sobstvennost). The former encompassed capital (means of production), while the latter described everything else in a person\'s possession. This distinction has been a source of confusion when interpreting phrases such as "socialism (communism) abolished private property" ; one might conclude that all individual property was abolished, when this was in fact not the case [ citation needed ] . \n [ edit ] Collective property \n There were several forms of collective ownership, the most significant being state property , kolkhoz property , and cooperative property . The most common forms of cooperative property were housing cooperatives (\xd0\xb6\xd0\xb8\xd0\xbb\xd0\xb8\xd1\x89\xd0\xbd\xd1\x8b\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x82\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb2\xd1\x8b) in urban areas, consumer cooperatives (\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb0\xd1\x8f \xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f, \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xba\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbe\xd0\xbf\xd0\xb5\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x86\xd0\xb8\xd1\x8f), and rural consumer societies (\xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe\xd1\x82\xd1\x80\xd0\xb5\xd0\xb1\xd0\xb8\xd1\x82\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb5 \xd0\xbe\xd0\xb1\xd1\x89\xd0\xb5\xd1\x81\xd1\x82\xd0\xb2\xd0\xb0, \xd1\x81\xd0\xb5\xd0\xbb\xd1\x8c\xd0\xbf\xd0\xbe). \n [ edit ] History \n [ edit ] Early development \n Both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and later, the Soviet Union , were countries in the process of industrialization . For both, this development occurred slowly and from a low initial starting point. Because of World War I , the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Russian Civil War industrial production had only managed to barely recover its 1913 level by 1926. [ 21 ] By this time about 18% of the population lived in non-rural areas, although only about 7.5% were employed in the non-agricultural sector. The remainder were stuck in the low productivity agriculture. [ 22 ] \n According to David A. Dyker , the Soviet Union of the 1930s can be regarded as a typical developing country, characterized by low capital investment and most of its population resident in the countryside. Part of the reason for low investment rates lay in the inability to acquire capital from abroad. This in turn, was the result of the repudiation of the debts of the Russian Empire by the Bolsheviks , as well as the world wide financial troubles. Consequently, any kind of economic growth had to be financed by domestic savings. [ 22 ] \n The economic problems in agriculture were further acerbated by natural conditions, such as long cold winters across the country, droughts in the south and acidic soils in the north. However, according to Dyker, the Soviet economy did have "extremely good" potential in the area of raw materials and mineral extraction, for example in the oil fields in Transcaucasia , and this, along with a small but growing manufacturing base, helped the USSR avoid any kind of balance of payments problems. [ 22 ] \n [ edit ] New Economic Policy (1921\xe2\x80\x939) \n Main article: New Economic Policy \n \n \n \n  \nThe two major economic policy makers of the USSR, Lenin (left) created the NEP while Stalin (right) created the planned economy \n \n \n By early 1921 it became apparent to the Bolsheviks that forced requisitioning of grain had resulted in low agricultural production and widespread opposition. As a result, the decision was made by Lenin and the Politburo to try an alternative approach. [ 23 ] The so-called New Economic Policy (NEP) was approved at the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) [ 24 ] \n Everything except "the commanding heights", as Lenin put it, of the economy would be privatized . "The commanding heights" included foreign trade , heavy industry , communication and transport among others. [ 23 ] In practice this limited the private sector to artisan and agricultural production/trade. [ 25 ] The NEP encountered strong resistance within the Bolshevik party. Lenin had to persuade communist skeptics that " state capitalism " was a necessary step in achieving communism , while he himself harbored suspicions that the policy could be abused by private businessmen (" NEPmen "). [ 26 ] \n As novelist Andrei Platonov , among others, noted, the improvements were immediate. Rationing cards and queues, which had become hallmarks of war communism , had disappeared. However, due to prolonged war, low harvests, and several natural disasters the Soviet economy was still in trouble, particularly its agricultural sector. In 1921 widespread famine broke out in the Volga-Ural region . The Soviet government changed its previous course and allowed international relief to come in from abroad, and established a special committee chaired by prominent communists and non-communists alike. Despite this, an estimated five million people died in the famine. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Stalinism \n Starting in 1928, the five-year plans began building a heavy industrial base at once in an underdeveloped economy without waiting years for capital to accumulate through the expansion of light industry, and without reliance on external financing. The country now became industrialized at a hitherto unprecedented pace, surpassing Germany \'s pace of industrialization in the 19th century and Japan \'s earlier in the 20th century. \n After the reconstruction of the economy (in the wake of the destruction caused by the Russian Civil War ) was completed, and after the initial plans of further industrialisation were fulfilled, the explosive growth slowed down, but still generally surpassed most of the other countries in terms of total material production ( GNP ) [ citation needed ] until the period of Brezhnev stagnation in the 1970s and 1980s. \n Led by the creation of NAMI , and by the GAZ copy of the Ford Model A in 1929, [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] industrialization came with the extension of medical services, which improved labor productivity . Campaigns were carried out against typhus , cholera , and malaria ; the number of physicians increased as rapidly as facilities and training would permit; and death and infant mortality rates steadily decreased. \n [ edit ] 1930\xe2\x80\x931970 \n \n \n \n  \nThe State Quality Mark of the USSR , introduced in 1967, was used to certify that goods met quality standards, and to improve the efficiency of production \n \n \n As weighed growth rates, economic planning performed very well during the early and mid-1930s, World War II -era mobilization, and for the first two decades of the postwar era. The Soviet Union became the world\'s leading producer of oil , coal , iron ore , and cement ; manganese , gold , natural gas and other minerals were also of major importance. However, information about the Soviet famine of 1932\xe2\x80\x931933 was suppressed by the Soviet authorities until perestroika . In 1933 workers\' real earnings sank to about one-tenth of the 1926 level. [ 30 ] Common and political prisoners in labor camps were forced to do unpaid labor, and communists and Komsomol members were frequently "mobilized" for various construction projects. \n The German invasion of World War II inflicted punishing blows to the economy of the USSR, with Soviet GDP falling 34% between 1940 and 1942. [ 31 ] Industrial output did not recover to its 1940 level for almost a decade. [ 18 ] \n In 1961, a new redenominated Soviet ruble was issued. It maintained exchange parity with the Pound Sterling until the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. After a new leadership, headed by Leonid Brezhnev , had come to power, attempts were made to revitalize the economy through economic reform . Starting in 1965, enterprises and organizations were made to rely on economic methods of profitable production, rather than follow orders from the state administration. By 1970, the Soviet economy had reached its zenith and was estimated at about 60 percent of the size of the USA [ citation needed ] in terms of the estimated commodities (like steel and coal). In 1989, the GDP of the Soviet Union was $2,500 Billion [ 32 ] while the GDP of the United States was $4,862 Billion [ 33 ] with per capita income figures as $8,700 and $19,800 respectively. \n \n \n \n  \n \n This article\'s factual accuracy is disputed .

Soviet military buildup at the expense of domestic development kept the USSR\'s GDP at the same level during the first half of the 1980s. [ citation needed ] The Soviet planned economy was not structured to respond adequately to the demands of the complex modern economy it had helped to forge. The massive quantities of goods produced often did not meet the needs or tastes of consumers. [ 34 ] The volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. The cumbersome procedures for bureaucratic administration foreclosed the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level for dealing with worker alienation, innovation, customers, and suppliers. During 1975\xe2\x80\x9385, corruption and data fiddling became common practice among bureaucracy to report satisfied targets and quotas thus entrenching the crisis. \n Awareness of the growing crisis arose initially within the KGB which with its extensive network of informants in every region and institution had its finger on the pulse of the nation. Yuri Andropov , director of the KGB, created a secret department during the 1970s within the KGB devoted to economic analysis, and when he succeeded Brezhnev in 1982 sounded the alarm forcefully to the Soviet leadership. Andropov\'s remedy of increased discipline, however, proved ineffective. It was only when Andropov\'s protege Gorbachev assumed power that a determined, but ultimately unsuccessful, assault on the economic crisis was undertaken.
