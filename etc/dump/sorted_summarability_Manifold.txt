The real projective plane is a two-dimensional manifold that cannot be realized in three dimensions without self-intersection, shown here as Boy's surface . 
 
 
 In mathematics , a manifold of dimension n is a topological space that near each point resembles n -dimensional Euclidean space . More precisely, each point of an n -dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n . Lines and circles , but not figure eights , are one-dimensional manifolds. Two-dimensional manifolds are also called surfaces . Examples include the plane , the sphere , and the torus , which can all be realized in three dimensions, but also the Klein bottle and real projective plane which cannot. 
 
 
 
  
The surface of the Earth requires (at least) two charts to include every point. 
 
 
 Although near each point, a manifold resembles Euclidean space, globally a manifold might not. For example, the surface of the sphere is not a Euclidean space, but in a region it can be charted by means of geographic maps : map projections of the region into the Euclidean plane . When a region appears in two neighbouring maps (in the context of manifolds they are called charts ), the two representations do not coincide exactly and a transformation is needed to pass from one to the other, called a transition map . 
 The concept of a manifold is central to many parts of geometry and modern mathematical physics because it allows more complicated structures to be described and understood in terms of the relatively well-understood properties of Euclidean space. Manifolds naturally arise as solution sets of systems of equations and as graphs of functions. Manifolds may have additional features. One important class of manifolds is the class of differentiable manifolds . This differentiable structure allows calculus to be done on manifolds. A Riemannian metric on a manifold allows distances and angles to be measured. Symplectic manifolds serve as the phase spaces in the Hamiltonian formalism of classical mechanics , while four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds model spacetime in general relativity .

Figure 1: The four charts each map part of the circle to an open interval, and together cover the whole circle. 
 
 
 After a line, the circle is the simplest example of a topological manifold. Topology ignores bending, so a small piece of a circle is treated exactly the same as a small piece of a line. Consider, for instance, the top half of the unit circle , x 2 &#160;+&#160; y 2 &#160;=&#160;1, where the y -coordinate is positive (indicated by the yellow arc in Figure 1 ). Any point of this semicircle can be uniquely described by its x -coordinate. So, projection onto the first coordinate is a continuous , and invertible , mapping from the upper semicircle to the open interval (−1,1): 
 
 
 
 Such functions along with the open regions they map are called chart s. Similarly, there are charts for the bottom (red), top (yellow), left (blue), and right (green) parts of the circle. Together, these parts cover the whole circle and the four charts form an atlas for the circle. 
 The top and right charts overlap: their intersection lies in the quarter of the circle where both the x - and the y -coordinates are positive. The two charts χ top and χ right each map this part into the interval (0,&#160;1). Thus a function T from (0,&#160;1) to itself can be constructed, which first uses the inverse of the top chart to reach the circle and then follows the right chart back to the interval. Let a be any number in (0,&#160;1), then: 
 
 
 
 Such a function is called a transition map . 
 
 
 
  
Figure 2: A circle manifold chart based on slope, covering all but one point of the circle. 
 
 
 The top, bottom, left, and right charts show that the circle is a manifold, but they do not form the only possible atlas. Charts need not be geometric projections, and the number of charts is a matter of some choice. Consider the charts 
 
 
 
 and 
 
 
 
 Here s is the slope of the line through the point at coordinates ( x , y ) and the fixed pivot point (−1,&#160;0); t is the mirror image, with pivot point (+1,&#160;0). The inverse mapping from s to ( x ,&#160; y ) is given by 
 
 
 
 It can easily be confirmed that x 2 &#160;+&#160; y 2 &#160;=&#160;1 for all values of the slope s . These two charts provide a second atlas for the circle, with 
 
 
 
 Each chart omits a single point, either (−1,&#160;0) for s or (+1,&#160;0) for t , so neither chart alone is sufficient to cover the whole circle. It can be proved that it is not possible to cover the full circle with a single chart. For example, although it is possible to construct a circle from a single line interval by overlapping and "gluing" the ends, this does not produce a chart; a portion of the circle will be mapped to both ends at once, losing invertibility. 
 [ edit ] Other curves 
 
 
 
  
Four manifolds from algebraic curves: 
 ■ &#160;circles, ■ &#160;parabola, ■ &#160;hyperbola, ■ &#160;cubic. 
 
 
 Manifolds need not be connected (all in "one piece"); an example is a pair of separate circles. 
 Manifolds need not be closed ; thus a line segment without its end points is a manifold. And they are never countable, unless the dimension of the manifold is 0. Putting these freedoms together, other examples of manifolds are a parabola , a hyperbola (two open, infinite pieces) and the locus of points on a cubic curve y 2 &#160;=&#160; x 3 − x (a closed loop piece and an open, infinite piece). 
 However, we exclude examples like two touching circles that share a point to form a figure-8; at the shared point we cannot create a satisfactory chart. Even with the bending allowed by topology, the vicinity of the shared point looks like a "+", not a line. A "+" is not homeomorphic to a closed interval (line segment) since deleting the center point from the "+" gives a space with four components (i.e. pieces) whereas deleting a point from a closed interval gives a space with at most two pieces; topological operations always preserve the number of pieces. 
 [ edit ] Enriched circle 
 Viewed using calculus , the circle transition function T is simply a function between open intervals, which gives a meaning to the statement that T is differentiable . The transition map T , and all the others, are differentiable on (0, 1); therefore, with this atlas the circle is a differentiable manifold . It is also smooth and analytic because the transition functions have these properties as well. 
 Other circle properties allow it to meet the requirements of more specialized types of manifold. For example, the circle has a notion of distance between two points, the arc-length between the points; hence it is a Riemannian manifold . 
 [ edit ] History 
 For more details on this topic, see History of manifolds and varieties . 
 The study of manifolds combines many important areas of mathematics: it generalizes concepts such as curves and surfaces as well as ideas from linear algebra and topology . 
 [ edit ] Early development 
 Before the modern concept of a manifold there were several important results. 
 Non-Euclidean geometry considers spaces where Euclid 's parallel postulate fails. Saccheri first studied them in 1733. Lobachevsky , Bolyai , and Riemann developed them 100 years later. Their research uncovered two types of spaces whose geometric structures differ from that of classical Euclidean space ; these gave rise to hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry . In the modern theory of manifolds, these notions correspond to Riemannian manifolds with constant negative and positive curvature , respectively. 
 Carl Friedrich Gauss may have been the first to consider abstract spaces as mathematical objects in their own right. His theorema egregium gives a method for computing the curvature of a surface without considering the ambient space in which the surface lies. Such a surface would, in modern terminology, be called a manifold; and in modern terms, the theorem proved that the curvature of the surface is an intrinsic property. Manifold theory has come to focus exclusively on these intrinsic properties (or invariants), while largely ignoring the extrinsic properties of the ambient space. 
 Another, more topological example of an intrinsic property of a manifold is its Euler characteristic . Leonhard Euler showed that for a convex polytope in the three-dimensional Euclidean space with V vertices (or corners), E edges, and F faces, 
 
 
 
 The same formula will hold if we project the vertices and edges of the polytope onto a sphere , creating a topological map with V vertices, E edges, and F faces, and in fact, will remain true for any spherical map, even if it does not arise from any convex polytope. [ 1 ] Thus 2 is a topological invariant of the sphere, called its Euler characteristic . On the other hand, a torus can be sliced open by its 'parallel' and 'meridian' circles, creating a map with V &#160;=&#160;1 vertex , E &#160;=&#160;2 edges, and F &#160;=&#160;1 face. Thus the Euler characteristic of the torus is 1&#160;−&#160;2&#160;+&#160;1&#160;=&#160;0. The Euler characteristic of other surfaces is a useful topological invariant , which can be extended to higher dimensions using Betti numbers . In the mid nineteenth century, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem linked the Euler characteristic to the Gaussian curvature. 
 [ edit ] Synthesis 
 Investigations of Niels Henrik Abel and Carl Gustav Jacobi on inversion of elliptic integrals in the first half of 19th century led them to consider special types of complex manifolds , now known as Jacobians . Bernhard Riemann further contributed to their theory, clarifying the geometric meaning of the process of analytic continuation of functions of complex variables. 
 Another important source of manifolds in 19th century mathematics was analytical mechanics , as developed by Simeon Poisson , Jacobi, and William Rowan Hamilton . The possible states of a mechanical system are thought to be points of an abstract space, phase space in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics. This space is, in fact, a high-dimensional manifold, whose dimension corresponds to the degrees of freedom of the system and where the points are specified by their generalized coordinates . For an unconstrained movement of free particles the manifold is equivalent to the Euclidean space, but various conservation laws constrain it to more complicated formations, e.g. Liouville tori . The theory of a rotating solid body, developed in the 18th century by Leonhard Euler and Joseph Lagrange , gives another example where the manifold is nontrivial. Geometrical and topological aspects of classical mechanics were emphasized by Henri Poincaré , one of the founders of topology . 
 Riemann was the first one to do extensive work generalizing the idea of a surface to higher dimensions. The name manifold comes from Riemann's original German term, Mannigfaltigkeit , which William Kingdon Clifford translated as "manifoldness". In his Göttingen inaugural lecture, Riemann described the set of all possible values of a variable with certain constraints as a Mannigfaltigkeit , because the variable can have many values. He distinguishes between stetige Mannigfaltigkeit and diskrete Mannigfaltigkeit ( continuous manifoldness and discontinuous manifoldness ), depending on whether the value changes continuously or not. As continuous examples, Riemann refers to not only colors and the locations of objects in space, but also the possible shapes of a spatial figure. Using induction , Riemann constructs an n-fach ausgedehnte Mannigfaltigkeit ( n times extended manifoldness or n-dimensional manifoldness ) as a continuous stack of (n−1) dimensional manifoldnesses. Riemann's intuitive notion of a Mannigfaltigkeit evolved into what is today formalized as a manifold. Riemannian manifolds and Riemann surfaces are named after Riemann. 
 [ edit ] Poincaré's definition 
 In his very influential paper, Analysis Situs , [ 2 ]  Henri Poincaré gave a definition of a (differentiable) manifold ( variété ) which served as a precursor to the modern concept of a manifold. [ 3 ] 
 In the first section of Analysis Situs, Poincaré defines a manifold as the level set of a continuously differentiable function between Euclidean spaces that satisfies the nondegeneracy hypothesis of the implicit function theorem . In the third section, he begins by remarking that the graph of a continuously differentiable function is a manifold in the latter sense. He then proposes a new, more general, definition of manifold based on a 'chain of manifolds' ( une chaîne des variétés ). 
 Poincaré's notion of a 'chain of manifolds' is a precursor to the modern notion of atlas . In particular, he considers two manifolds defined respectively as graphs of functions and . If these manifolds overlap ( a une partie commune ), then he requires that the coordinates depend continuously differentiably on the coordinates and vice versa (' ...les sont fonctions analytiques des et inversement '). In this way he introduces a precursor to the notion of a chart and of a transition map . Note that it is implicit in Analysis Situs that a manifold obtained as a 'chain' is a subset of Euclidean space. 
 For example, the unit circle in the plane can be thought of as the graph of the function or else the function in a neighborhood of every point except the points (1,0) and (−1,0); and in a neighborhood of those points, it can be thought of as the graph of, respectively, and . The reason the circle can be represented by a graph in the neighborhood of every point is because the left hand side of its defining equation has nonzero gradient at every point of the circle. By the implicit function theorem , every submanifold of Euclidean space is locally the graph of a function. 
 Hermann Weyl gave an intrinsic definition for differentiable manifolds in his lecture course on Riemann surfaces in 1911–1912, opening the road to the general concept of a topological space that followed shortly. During the 1930s Hassler Whitney and others clarified the foundational aspects of the subject, and thus intuitions dating back to the latter half of the 19th century became precise, and developed through differential geometry and Lie group theory. Notably, the Whitney embedding theorem [ 4 ] showed that the intrinsic definition in terms of charts was equivalent to Poincaré's definition in terms of subsets of Euclidean space. 
 [ edit ] Topology of manifolds: highlights 
 Two-dimensional manifolds, also known as a 2D surfaces embedded in our common 3D space, were considered by Riemann under the guise of Riemann surfaces , and rigorously classified in the beginning of the 20th century by Poul Heegaard and Max Dehn . Henri Poincaré pioneered the study of three-dimensional manifolds and raised a fundamental question about them, today known as the Poincaré conjecture . After nearly a century of effort by many mathematicians, starting with Poincaré himself, a consensus among experts (as of 2006) is that Grigori Perelman has proved the Poincaré conjecture (see the Solution of the Poincaré conjecture ). William Thurston 's geometrization program , formulated in the 1970s, provided a far-reaching extension of the Poincaré conjecture to the general three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds were brought to the forefront of mathematical research in the 1980s by Michael Freedman and in a different setting, by Simon Donaldson , who was motivated by the then recent progress in theoretical physics ( Yang–Mills theory ), where they serve as a substitute for ordinary 'flat' spacetime . Andrey Markov Jr. showed in 1960 that no algorithm exists for classifying four-dimensional manifolds. Important work on higher-dimensional manifolds, including analogues of the Poincaré conjecture , had been done earlier by René Thom , John Milnor , Stephen Smale and Sergei Novikov . One of the most pervasive and flexible techniques underlying much work on the topology of manifolds is Morse theory . 
 [ edit ] Mathematical definition 
 For more details on this topic, see Categories of manifolds . 
 Informally, a manifold is a space that is "modeled on" Euclidean space . 
 There are many different kinds of manifolds and generalizations. In geometry and topology , all manifolds are topological manifolds , possibly with additional structure, most often a differentiable structure . In terms of constructing manifolds via patching, a manifold has an additional structure if the transition maps between different patches satisfy axioms beyond just continuity. For instance, differentiable manifolds have homeomorphisms on overlapping neighborhoods diffeomorphic with each other, so that the manifold has a well-defined set of functions which are differentiable in each neighborhood, and so differentiable on the manifold as a whole. 
 Formally, a topological manifold [ 5 ] is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. 
 Second countable and Hausdorff are point-set conditions; second countable excludes spaces which are in some sense 'too large' such as the long line , while Hausdorff excludes spaces such as "the line with two origins" (these generalizations of manifolds are discussed in non-Hausdorff manifolds ). 
 Locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space means [ 6 ] that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open Euclidean n -ball , 
 
 
 
 Generally manifolds are taken to have a fixed dimension (the space must be locally homeomorphic to a fixed n -ball), and such a space is called an n -manifold ; however, some authors [ citation needed ] admit manifolds where different points can have different dimensions . If a manifold has a fixed dimension, it is called a pure manifold . For example, the sphere has a constant dimension of 2 and is therefore a pure manifold whereas the disjoint union of a sphere and a line in three-dimensional space is not a pure manifold. Since dimension is a local invariant (i.e. the map sending each point to the dimension of its neighbourhood over which a chart is defined, is locally constant ), each connected component has a fixed dimension. 
 Scheme-theoretically , a manifold is a locally ringed space , whose structure sheaf is locally isomorphic to the sheaf of continuous (or differentiable, or complex-analytic, etc.) functions on Euclidean space. This definition is mostly used when discussing analytic manifolds in algebraic geometry . 
 [ edit ] Broad definition 
 Main article: Banach manifold 
 The broadest common definition of manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a topological vector space over the reals. This omits the point-set axioms, allowing higher cardinalities and non-Hausdorff manifolds ; and it omits finite dimension, allowing structures such as Hilbert manifolds to be modeled on Hilbert spaces , Banach manifolds to be modeled on Banach spaces , and Fréchet manifolds to be modeled on Fréchet spaces . Usually one relaxes one or the other condition: manifolds with the point-set axioms are studied in general topology , while infinite-dimensional manifolds are studied in functional analysis . 
 [ edit ] Charts, atlases, and transition maps 
 Main article: Atlas (topology) 
 See also: Differentiable manifold 
 The spherical Earth is navigated using flat maps or charts, collected in an atlas. Similarly, a differentiable manifold can be described using mathematical maps , called coordinate charts , collected in a mathematical atlas . It is not generally possible to describe a manifold with just one chart, because the global structure of the manifold is different from the simple structure of the charts. For example, no single flat map can represent the entire Earth without separation of adjacent features across the map's boundaries or duplication of coverage. When a manifold is constructed from multiple overlapping charts, the regions where they overlap carry information essential to understanding the global structure. 
 [ edit ] Charts 
 A coordinate map , a coordinate chart , or simply a chart , of a manifold is an invertible map between a subset of the manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure. [ 7 ] For a topological manifold, the simple space is some Euclidean space R n and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by homeomorphisms , invertible maps that are continuous in both directions. 
 In the case of a differentiable manifold , a set of charts called an atlas allows us to do calculus on manifolds. Polar coordinates , for example, form a chart for the plane R 2 minus the positive x -axis and the origin. Another example of a chart is the map χ top mentioned in the section above, a chart for the circle. 
 [ edit ] Atlases 
 The description of most manifolds requires more than one chart (a single chart is adequate for only the simplest manifolds). A specific collection of charts which covers a manifold is called an atlas . An atlas is not unique as all manifolds can be covered multiple ways using different combinations of charts. Two atlases are said to be C k equivalent if their union is also a C k atlas. 
 The atlas containing all possible charts consistent with a given atlas is called the maximal atlas (i.e. an equivalence class containing that given atlas (under the already defined equivalence relation given in the previous paragraph)). Unlike an ordinary atlas, the maximal atlas of a given manifold is unique. Though it is useful for definitions, it is an abstract object and not used directly (e.g. in calculations). 
 [ edit ] Transition maps 
 Charts in an atlas may overlap and a single point of a manifold may be represented in several charts. If two charts overlap, parts of them represent the same region of the manifold, just as a map of Europe and a map of Asia may both contain Moscow. Given two overlapping charts, a transition function can be defined which goes from an open ball in R n to the manifold and then back to another (or perhaps the same) open ball in R n . The resultant map, like the map T in the circle example above, is called a change of coordinates , a coordinate transformation , a transition function , or a transition map . 
 [ edit ] Additional structure 
 An atlas can also be used to define additional structure on the manifold. The structure is first defined on each chart separately. If all the transition maps are compatible with this structure, the structure transfers to the manifold. 
 This is the standard way differentiable manifolds are defined. If the transition functions of an atlas for a topological manifold preserve the natural differential structure of R n (that is, if they are diffeomorphisms ), the differential structure transfers to the manifold and turns it into a differentiable manifold. Complex manifolds are introduced in an analogous way by requiring that the transition functions of an atlas are holomorphic functions. For symplectic manifolds , the transition functions must be symplectomorphisms . 
 The structure on the manifold depends on the atlas, but sometimes different atlases can be said to give rise to the same structure. Such atlases are called compatible . 
 These notions are made precise in general through the use of pseudogroups . 
 [ edit ] Manifold with boundary 
 See also: Topological manifold#Manifolds with boundary 
 A manifold with boundary is a manifold with an edge. For example a sheet of paper is a 2-manifold with a 1-dimensional boundary. The boundary of an n -manifold with boundary is an ( n &#160;−&#160;1)-manifold. A disk (circle plus interior) is a 2-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a circle, a 1-manifold . A square with interior is also a 2-manifold with boundary. A ball (sphere plus interior) is a 3-manifold with boundary. Its boundary is a sphere, a 2-manifold. (See also Boundary (topology) ). 
 In technical language, a manifold with boundary is a space containing both interior points and boundary points. Every interior point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the open n -ball {( x 1 ,&#160; x 2 ,&#160;…,&#160; x n ) | Σ x i 2 &#160;&lt;&#160;1}. Every boundary point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the "half" n -ball {( x 1 ,&#160; x 2 ,&#160;…,&#160; x n ) | Σ x i 2 &#160;&lt;&#160;1 and x 1 &#160;≥&#160;0}. The homeomorphism must send each boundary point to a point with x 1 &#160;=&#160;0. 
 [ edit ] Boundary and interior 
 Let M be a manifold with boundary. The interior of M , denoted Int M , is the set of points in M which have neighborhoods homeomorphic to an open subset of R n . The boundary of M , denoted ∂ M , is the complement of Int M in M . The boundary points can be characterized as those points which land on the boundary hyperplane ( x n = 0) of R n + under some coordinate chart. 
 If M is a manifold with boundary of dimension n , then Int M is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension n and ∂ M is a manifold (without boundary) of dimension n − 1. 
 [ edit ] Construction 
 A single manifold can be constructed in different ways, each stressing a different aspect of the manifold, thereby leading to a slightly different viewpoint. 
 [ edit ] Charts 
 
 
 
  
The chart maps the part of the sphere with positive z coordinate to a disc. 
 
 
 Perhaps the simplest way to construct a manifold is the one used in the example above of the circle. First, a subset of R 2 is identified, and then an atlas covering this subset is constructed. The concept of manifold grew historically from constructions like this. Here is another example, applying this method to the construction of a sphere: 
 [ edit ] Sphere with charts 
 A sphere can be treated in almost the same way as the circle. In mathematics a sphere is just the surface (not the solid interior), which can be defined as a subset of R 3 : 
 
 
 
 The sphere is two-dimensional, so each chart will map part of the sphere to an open subset of R 2 . Consider the northern hemisphere, which is the part with positive z coordinate (coloured red in the picture on the right). The function χ defined by 
 
 
 
 maps the northern hemisphere to the open unit disc by projecting it on the ( x , y ) plane. A similar chart exists for the southern hemisphere. Together with two charts projecting on the ( x , z ) plane and two charts projecting on the ( y , z ) plane, an atlas of six charts is obtained which covers the entire sphere. 
 This can be easily generalized to higher-dimensional spheres. 
 [ edit ] Patchwork 
 A manifold can be constructed by gluing together pieces in a consistent manner, making them into overlapping charts. This construction is possible for any manifold and hence it is often used as a characterisation, especially for differentiable and Riemannian manifolds. It focuses on an atlas, as the patches naturally provide charts, and since there is no exterior space involved it leads to an intrinsic view of the manifold. 
 The manifold is constructed by specifying an atlas, which is itself defined by transition maps. A point of the manifold is therefore an equivalence class of points which are mapped to each other by transition maps. Charts map equivalence classes to points of a single patch. There are usually strong demands on the consistency of the transition maps. For topological manifolds they are required to be homeomorphisms ; if they are also diffeomorphisms , the resulting manifold is a differentiable manifold. 
 This can be illustrated with the transition map t = 1 ⁄ s from the second half of the circle example. Start with two copies of the line. Use the coordinate s for the first copy, and t for the second copy. Now, glue both copies together by identifying the point t on the second copy with the point s = 1 ⁄ t on the first copy (the points t = 0 and s = 0 are not identified with any point on the first and second copy, respectively). This gives a circle. 
 [ edit ] Intrinsic and extrinsic view 
 The first construction and this construction are very similar, but they represent rather different points of view. In the first construction, the manifold is seen as embedded in some Euclidean space. This is the extrinsic view . When a manifold is viewed in this way, it is easy to use intuition from Euclidean spaces to define additional structure. For example, in a Euclidean space it is always clear whether a vector at some point is tangential or normal to some surface through that point. 
 The patchwork construction does not use any embedding, but simply views the manifold as a topological space by itself. This abstract point of view is called the intrinsic view . It can make it harder to imagine what a tangent vector might be, and there is no intrinsic notion of a normal bundle, but instead there is an intrinsic stable normal bundle . 
 [ edit ] n -Sphere as a patchwork 
 The n -sphere S n is a generalisation of the idea of a circle (1-sphere) and sphere (2-sphere) to higher dimensions. An n -sphere S n can be constructed by gluing together two copies of R n . The transition map between them is defined as 
 
 
 
 This function is its own inverse and thus can be used in both directions. As the transition map is a smooth function , this atlas defines a smooth manifold. In the case n = 1, the example simplifies to the circle example given earlier. 
 [ edit ] Identifying points of a manifold 
 Main articles: Orbifold and Group action 
 It is possible to define different points of a manifold to be same. This can be visualized as gluing these points together in a single point, forming a quotient space . There is, however, no reason to expect such quotient spaces to be manifolds. Among the possible quotient spaces that are not necessarily manifolds, orbifolds and CW complexes are considered to be relatively well-behaved . An example of a quotient space of a manifold that is also a manifold is the real projective space identified as a quotient space of the corresponding sphere. 
 One method of identifying points (gluing them together) is through a right (or left) action of a group , which acts on the manifold. Two points are identified if one is moved onto the other by some group element. If M is the manifold and G is the group, the resulting quotient space is denoted by M / G (or G \ M ). 
 Manifolds which can be constructed by identifying points include tori and real projective spaces (starting with a plane and a sphere, respectively). 
 [ edit ] Gluing along boundaries 
 Main article: Quotient space 
 Two manifolds with boundaries can be glued together along a boundary. If this is done the right way, the result is also a manifold. Similarly, two boundaries of a single manifold can be glued together. 
 Formally, the gluing is defined by a bijection between the two boundaries [ dubious – discuss ] . Two points are identified when they are mapped onto each other. For a topological manifold this bijection should be a homeomorphism, otherwise the result will not be a topological manifold. Similarly for a differentiable manifold it has to be a diffeomorphism . For other manifolds other structures should be preserved. 
 A finite cylinder may be constructed as a manifold by starting with a strip [0, 1]&#160;×&#160;[0, 1] and gluing a pair of opposite edges on the boundary by a suitable diffeomorphism. A projective plane may be obtained by gluing a sphere with a hole in it to a Möbius strip along their respective circular boundaries. 
 [ edit ] Cartesian products 
 The Cartesian product of manifolds is also a manifold. 
 The dimension of the product manifold is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. Its topology is the product topology , and a Cartesian product of charts is a chart for the product manifold. Thus, an atlas for the product manifold can be constructed using atlases for its factors. If these atlases define a differential structure on the factors, the corresponding atlas defines a differential structure on the product manifold. The same is true for any other structure defined on the factors. If one of the factors has a boundary, the product manifold also has a boundary. Cartesian products may be used to construct tori and finite cylinders , for example, as S 1 &#160;×&#160; S 1 and S 1 &#160;×&#160;[0,&#160;1], respectively. 
 
 
 
  
A finite cylinder is a manifold with boundary.

 The simplest kind of manifold to define is the topological manifold, which looks locally like some "ordinary" Euclidean space R n . Formally, a topological manifold is a topological space locally homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. This means that every point has a neighbourhood for which there exists a homeomorphism (a bijective continuous function whose inverse is also continuous) mapping that neighbourhood to R n . These homeomorphisms are the charts of the manifold. 
 It is to be noted that a topological manifold looks locally like a Euclidean space in a rather weak manner: while for each individual chart it is possible to distinguish differentiable functions or measure distances and angles, merely by virtue of being a topological manifold a space does not have any particular and consistent choice of such concepts. In order to discuss such properties for a manifold, one needs to specify further structure and consider differentiable manifolds and Riemannian manifolds discussed below. In particular, the same underlying topological manifold can have several mutually incompatible classes of differentiable functions and an infinite number of ways to specify distances and angles. 
 Usually additional technical assumptions on the topological space are made to exclude pathological cases. It is customary to require that the space be Hausdorff and second countable . 
 The dimension of the manifold at a certain point is the dimension of the Euclidean space that the charts at that point map to (number n in the definition). All points in a connected manifold have the same dimension. Some authors require that all charts of a topological manifold map to Euclidean spaces of same dimension. In that case every topological manifold has a topological invariant, its dimension. Other authors allow disjoint unions of topological manifolds with differing dimensions to be called manifolds. 
 [ edit ] Differentiable manifolds 
 Main article: Differentiable manifold 
 For most applications a special kind of topological manifold, a differentiable manifold , is used. If the local charts on a manifold are compatible in a certain sense, one can define directions, tangent spaces, and differentiable functions on that manifold. In particular it is possible to use calculus on a differentiable manifold. Each point of an n -dimensional differentiable manifold has a tangent space . This is an n -dimensional Euclidean space consisting of the tangent vectors of the curves through the point. 
 Two important classes of differentiable manifolds are smooth and analytic manifolds . For smooth manifolds the transition maps are smooth , that is infinitely differentiable. Analytic manifolds are smooth manifolds with the additional condition that the transition maps are analytic (they can be expressed as power series ). The sphere can be given analytic structure, as can most familiar curves and surfaces. 
 There are also topological manifolds, i.e., locally Euclidean spaces, which possess no differentiable structures at all. [ 8 ] 
 A rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piecewise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds. 
 [ edit ] Riemannian manifolds 
 Main article: Riemannian manifold 
 To measure distances and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A 'Riemannian manifold' is a differentiable manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with an inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. Given two tangent vectors u and v , the inner product ⟨ u , v ⟩ gives a real number. The dot (or scalar) product is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length , angles , areas (or volumes ), curvature , gradients of functions and divergence of vector fields . 
 All differentiable manifolds (of constant dimension) can be given the structure of a Riemannian manifold. The Euclidean space itself carries a natural structure of Riemannian manifold (the tangent spaces are naturally identified with the Euclidean space itself and carry the standard scalar product of the space). Many familiar curves and surfaces, including for example all n -spheres, are specified as subspaces of a Euclidean space and inherit a metric from their embedding in it. 
 [ edit ] Finsler manifolds 
 Main article: Finsler manifold 
 A Finsler manifold allows the definition of distance but does not require the concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a norm , ||·||, in a manner which varies smoothly from point to point. This norm can be extended to a metric , defining the length of a curve; but it cannot in general be used to define an inner product. 
 Any Riemannian manifold is a Finsler manifold. 
 [ edit ] Lie groups 
 Main article: Lie group 
 Lie groups , named after Sophus Lie , are differentiable manifolds that carry also the structure of a group which is such that the group operations are defined by smooth maps. 
 A Euclidean vector space with the group operation of vector addition is an example of a non-compact Lie group. A simple example of a compact Lie group is the circle: the group operation is simply rotation. This group, known as U(1), can be also characterised as the group of complex numbers of modulus 1 with multiplication as the group operation. Other examples of Lie groups include special groups of matrices , which are all subgroups of the general linear group , the group of n by n matrices with non-zero determinant. If the matrix entries are real numbers , this will be an n 2 -dimensional disconnected manifold. The orthogonal groups , the symmetry groups of the sphere and hyperspheres , are n ( n −1)/2 dimensional manifolds, where n −1 is the dimension of the sphere. Further examples can be found in the table of Lie groups . 
 [ edit ] Other types of manifolds 
 Main articles: Complex manifold and Symplectic manifold 
 
 A ' complex manifold ' is a manifold modeled on 'C' n with holomorphic transition functions on chart overlaps. These manifolds are the basic objects of study in complex geometry. A one-complex-dimensional manifold is called a Riemann surface . Note that an n -dimensional complex manifold has dimension 2 n as a real differentiable manifold. 
 A ' CR manifold ' is a manifold modeled on boundaries of domains in C n . 
 'Infinite dimensional manifolds': to allow for infinite dimensions, one may consider Banach manifolds which are locally homeomorphic to Banach spaces . Similarly, Fréchet manifolds are locally homeomorphic to Fréchet spaces . 
 A ' symplectic manifold ' is a kind of manifold which is used to represent the phase spaces in classical mechanics . They are endowed with a 2-form that defines the Poisson bracket . A closely related type of manifold is a contact manifold . 
 A ' combinatorial manifold ' is a kind of manifold which is discretization of a manifold. It usually means a piecewise linear manifold made by simplicial complexes . 
 A ' digital manifold ' is a special kind of combinatorial manifold which is defined in digital space. See digital topology 
 
 [ edit ] Classification and invariants 
 For more details on this topic, see Classification of manifolds . 
 Different notions of manifolds have different notions of classification and invariant; in this section we focus on smooth closed manifolds. 
 The classification of smooth closed manifolds is well-understood in principle , except in dimension 4 : in low dimensions (2 and 3) it is geometric, via the uniformization theorem and the Solution of the Poincaré conjecture , and in high dimension (5 and above) it is algebraic, via surgery theory . This is a classification in principle: the general question of whether two smooth manifolds are diffeomorphic is not computable in general . Further, specific computations remain difficult, and there are many open questions. 
 Orientable surfaces can be visualized, and their diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two orientable surfaces, one can determine if they are diffeomorphic by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are diffeomorphic if and only if the genera are equal, so the genus forms a complete set of invariants . 
 This is much harder in higher dimensions: higher dimensional manifolds cannot be directly visualized (though visual intuition is useful in understanding them), nor can their diffeomorphism classes be enumerated, nor can one in general determine if two different descriptions of a higher-dimensional manifold refer to the same object. 
 However, one can determine if two manifolds are different if there is some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants , because, while they may be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are invariant under different descriptions. 
 Naively, one could hope to develop an arsenal of invariant criteria that would definitively classify all manifolds up to isomorphism. Unfortunately, it is known that for manifolds of dimension 4 and higher, no program exists that can decide whether two manifolds are diffeomorphic. 
 Smooth manifolds have a rich set of invariants , coming from point-set topology , classic algebraic topology , and geometric topology . The most familiar invariants, which are visible for surfaces, are orientability (a normal invariant, also detected by homology ) and genus (a homological invariant). 
 Smooth closed manifolds have no local invariants (other than dimension), though geometric manifolds have local invariants, notably the curvature of a Riemannian manifold and the torsion of a manifold equipped with an affine connection . This distinction between no local invariants and local invariants is a common way to distinguish between geometry and topology . All invariants of a smooth closed manifold are thus global. 
 Algebraic topology is a source of a number of important global invariant properties. Some key criteria include the simply connected property and orientability (see below). Indeed several branches of mathematics, such as homology and homotopy theory, and the theory of characteristic classes were founded in order to study invariant properties of manifolds. 
 [ edit ] Examples of surfaces 
 [ edit ] Orientability 
 Main article: Orientable manifold 
 In dimensions two and higher, a simple but important invariant criterion is the question of whether a manifold admits a meaningful orientation. Consider a topological manifold with charts mapping to R n . Given an ordered basis for R n , a chart causes its piece of the manifold to itself acquire a sense of ordering, which in 3-dimensions can be viewed as either right-handed or left-handed. Overlapping charts are not required to agree in their sense of ordering, which gives manifolds an important freedom. For some manifolds, like the sphere, charts can be chosen so that overlapping regions agree on their "handedness"; these are orientable manifolds. For others, this is impossible. The latter possibility is easy to overlook, because any closed surface embedded (without self-intersection) in three-dimensional space is orientable. 
 Some illustrative examples of non-orientable manifolds include: (1) the Möbius strip , which is a manifold with boundary, (2) the Klein bottle , which must intersect itself in 3-space, and (3) the real projective plane , which arises naturally in geometry . 
 
 
 
  
Möbius strip 
 
 
 [ edit ] Möbius strip 
 Main article: Möbius strip 
 Begin with an infinite circular cylinder standing vertically, a manifold without boundary. Slice across it high and low to produce two circular boundaries, and the cylindrical strip between them. This is an orientable manifold with boundary, upon which "surgery" will be performed. Slice the strip open, so that it could unroll to become a rectangle, but keep a grasp on the cut ends. Twist one end 180°, making the inner surface face out, and glue the ends back together seamlessly. This results in a strip with a permanent half-twist: the Möbius strip . Its boundary is no longer a pair of circles, but (topologically) a single circle; and what was once its "inside" has merged with its "outside", so that it now has only a single side. 
 [ edit ] Klein bottle 
 Main article: Klein bottle 
 
 
 
  
The Klein bottle immersed in three-dimensional space 
 
 
 Take two Möbius strips; each has a single loop as a boundary. Straighten out those loops into circles, and let the strips distort into cross-caps . Gluing the circles together will produce a new, closed manifold without boundary, the Klein bottle . Closing the surface does nothing to improve the lack of orientability, it merely removes the boundary. Thus, the Klein bottle is a closed surface with no distinction between inside and outside. Note that in three-dimensional space, a Klein bottle's surface must pass through itself. Building a Klein bottle which is not self-intersecting requires four or more dimensions of space. 
 [ edit ] Real projective plane 
 Main article: Real projective space 
 Begin with a sphere centered on the origin. Every line through the origin pierces the sphere in two opposite points called antipodes . Although there is no way to do so physically, it is possible (by considering a quotient space ) to mathematically merge each antipode pair into a single point. The closed surface so produced is the real projective plane , yet another non-orientable surface. It has a number of equivalent descriptions and constructions, but this route explains its name: all the points on any given line through the origin project to the same "point" on this "plane". 
 [ edit ] Genus and the Euler characteristic 
 For two dimensional manifolds a key invariant property is the genus , or the "number of handles" present in a surface. A torus is a sphere with one handle, a double torus is a sphere with two handles, and so on. Indeed it is possible to fully characterize compact, two-dimensional manifolds on the basis of genus and orientability. In higher-dimensional manifolds genus is replaced by the notion of Euler characteristic , and more generally Betti numbers and homology and cohomology . 
 [ edit ] Maps of manifolds 
 
 
 
  
A Morin surface , an immersion used in sphere eversion 
 
 
 Main article: Maps of manifolds 
 Just as there are various types of manifolds, there are various types of maps of manifolds . In addition to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings , of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions , submersions , covering spaces , and ramified covering spaces . Basic results include the Whitney embedding theorem and Whitney immersion theorem . 
 In Riemannian geometry, one may ask for maps to preserve the Riemannian metric, leading to notions of isometric embeddings , isometric immersions , and Riemannian submersions ; a basic result is the Nash embedding theorem . 
 [ edit ] Scalar-valued functions 
 
 
 
  
3D color plot of the spherical harmonics of degree 
 
 
 A basic example of maps between manifolds are scalar-valued functions on a manifold, 
 
 or 
 
 sometimes called regular functions or functionals , by analogy with algebraic geometry or linear algebra. These are of interest both in their own right, and to study the underlying manifold. 
 In geometric topology, most commonly studied are Morse functions , which yield handlebody decompositions, while in mathematical analysis , one often studies solution to partial differential equations , an important example of which is harmonic analysis , where one studies harmonic functions : the kernel of the Laplace operator . This leads to such functions as the spherical harmonics , and to heat kernel methods of studying manifolds, such as hearing the shape of a drum and some proofs of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem . 
 [ edit ] Generalizations of manifolds 
 
 Orbifolds : An orbifold is a generalization of manifold allowing for certain kinds of " singularities " in the topology. Roughly speaking, it is a space which locally looks like the quotients of some simple space ( e.g. Euclidean space ) by the actions of various finite groups . The singularities correspond to fixed points of the group actions, and the actions must be compatible in a certain sense. 
 
 
 Algebraic varieties and schemes : Non-singular algebraic varieties over the real or complex numbers are manifolds. One generalizes this first by allowing singularities, secondly by allowing different fields, and thirdly by emulating the patching construction of manifolds: just as a manifold is glued together from open subsets of Euclidean space, an algebraic variety is glued together from affine algebraic varieties, which are zero sets of polynomials over algebraically closed fields. Schemes are likewise glued together from affine schemes, which are a generalization of algebraic varieties. Both are related to manifolds, but are constructed algebraically using sheaves instead of atlases. 
 
 
 Because of singular points , a variety is in general not a manifold, though linguistically the French variété , German Mannigfaltigkeit and English manifold are largely synonymous . In French an algebraic variety is called une variété algébrique (an algebraic variety ), while a smooth manifold is called une variété différentielle (a differential variety ). 
 
 
 Stratified space : A "stratified space" is a space that can be divided into pieces ("strata"), with each strata a manifold, with the strata fitting together in prescribed ways (formally, a filtration by closed subsets). There are various technical definitions, notably a Whitney stratified space (see Whitney conditions ) for smooth manifolds and a topologically stratified space for topological manifolds. Basic examples include manifold with boundary (top dimensional manifold and codimension 1 boundary) and manifold with corners (top dimensional manifold, codimension 1 boundary, codimension 2 corners). Whitney stratified spaces are a broad class of spaces, including algebraic varieties, analytic varieties, semialgebraic sets , and subanalytic sets . 
 
 
 CW-complexes : A CW complex is a topological space formed by gluing disks of different dimensionality together. In general the resulting space is singular, and hence not a manifold. However, they are of central interest in algebraic topology , especially in homotopy theory , as they are easy to compute with and singularities are not a concern. 
 
 
 Homology manifolds : A homology manifold is a space that behaves like a manifold from the point of view of homology theory. These are not all manifolds, but (in high dimension) can be analyzed by surgery theory similarly to manifolds, and failure to be a manifold is a local obstruction, as in surgery theory. [ 9 ] 
 
 [ edit ] Centrality of manifolds 
 Why does one study manifolds? Manifolds, and generalized spaces composed of manifolds such as stratified spaces, occupy a central role in topology. This is for a variety of reasons, including that they often arise in practice, as solution sets of equations (elaborated above by the fact that algebraic varieties, analytic varieties, etc. can be stratified into manifold pieces), and that they are the space "modeled on" Euclidean space (a space that looks locally like Euclidean space) – i.e., they arise naturally when considering subsets and quotients of Euclidean space. 
 More abstractly, a natural class of objects to study in topology are objects that are homogeneous (all points are topologically the same: the group of self-homeomorphisms acts transitively) and "finite type" or "tame" (to rule out spaces such as the Cantor set , where each open set contains uncountably many connected components); more generally, a space of "finite type" where the self-homeomorphism group has finitely many orbits, forming the strata. Manifolds are homogeneous and tame (locally isomorphic to Euclidean space) in this manner, and one may ask if all "tame" homogeneous spaces are manifolds, [ 10 ] or whether there is a natural class where more general spaces are also included. As stated, this is a meta-mathematical question; the Bing–Borsuk conjecture gives a concrete statement, conjecturing that a homogeneous ENR is a manifold, where ENR, a tameness condition, means a Euclidean neighborhood retract – a retract of an open subset of Euclidean space, or equivalently an absolute neighborhood retract (ANR) that embeds in Euclidean space. This is an open question; a candidate counterexample is given by generalizing to homology manifolds (that are finite-dimensional ANRs), in which case certain such spaces are not manifolds, but have not been shown to be homogeneous, hence may not be a counterexample.

 A nondifferentiable atlas of charts for the globe. The results of calculus may not be compatible between charts if the atlas is not differentiable. In the middle chart the Tropic of Cancer is a smooth curve, whereas in the first it has a sharp corner. The notion of a differentiable manifold refines that of a manifold by requiring the functions that transform between charts to be differentiable. 
 
 
 In mathematics, a differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus . Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts , also known as an atlas. One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable ), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart. 
 In formal terms, a differentiable manifold is a topological manifold with a globally defined differential structure . Any topological manifold can be given a differential structure locally by using the homeomorphisms in its atlas and the standard differential structure on a linear space. To induce a global differential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the homeomorphisms, their composition on chart intersections in the atlas must be differentiable functions on the corresponding linear space. In other words, where the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are required to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every chart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various charts to one another are called transition maps. 
 Differentiability means different things in different contexts including: continuously differentiable , k times differentiable, and holomorphic . Furthermore, the ability to induce such a differential structure on an abstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to spaces without global coordinate systems. A differential structure allows one to define the globally differentiable tangent space , differentiable functions, and differentiable tensor and vector fields. Differentiable manifolds are very important in physics . Special kinds of differentiable manifolds form the basis for physical theories such as classical mechanics , general relativity , and Yang–Mills theory. It is possible to develop a calculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical machinery as the exterior calculus. The study of calculus on differentiable manifolds is known as differential geometry.

 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of manifolds and varieties 
 The emergence of differential geometry as a distinct discipline is generally credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann . Riemann first described manifolds in his famous habilitation lecture [ 1 ] before the faculty at Göttingen. He motivated the idea of a manifold by an intuitive process of varying a given object in a new direction, and presciently described the role of coordinate systems and charts in subsequent formal developments: 
 
 Having constructed the notion of a manifoldness of n dimensions, and found that its true character consists in the property that the determination of position in it may be reduced to n determinations of magnitude, ... – B. Riemann 
 
 The works of physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell [ citation needed ] , and mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita [ 2 ] led to the development of tensor analysis and the notion of covariance , which identifies an intrinsic geometric property as one that is invariant with respect to coordinate transformations . These ideas found a key application in Einstein 's theory of general relativity and its underlying equivalence principle . A modern definition of a 2-dimensional manifold was given by Hermann Weyl in his 1913 book on Riemann surfaces . [ 3 ] The widely accepted general definition of a manifold in terms of an atlas is due to Hassler Whitney . [ 4 ] 
 [ edit ] Definition 
 A presentation of a topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a linear space, by a collection (called an atlas ) of homeomorphisms called charts . The composition of one chart with the inverse of another chart is a function called a transition map , and defines a homeomorphism of an open subset of the linear space onto another open subset of the linear space. This formalizes the notion of "patching together pieces of a space to make a manifold" – the manifold produced also contains the data of how it has been patched together. However, different atlases (patchings) may produce "the same" manifold; a manifold does not come with a preferred atlas. And, thus, one defines a topological manifold to be a space as above with an equivalence class of atlases, where one defines equivalence of atlases below. 
 There are a number of different types of differentiable manifolds, depending on the precise differentiability requirements on the transition functions. Some common examples include the following. 
 
 A differentiable manifold is a topological manifold equipped with an equivalence class of atlases whose transition maps are all differentiable. In broader terms, a C k -manifold is a topological manifold with an atlas whose transition maps are all k -times continuously differentiable. 
 
 
 A smooth manifold or C ∞ -manifold is a differentiable manifold for which all the transition maps are smooth . That is, derivatives of all orders exist; so it is a C k -manifold for all k . An equivalence class of such atlases is said to be a smooth structure . 
 
 
 An analytic manifold , or C ω -manifold is a smooth manifold with the additional condition that each transition map is analytic : the Taylor expansion is absolutely convergent and equals the function on some open ball. 
 
 
 A complex manifold is a topological space modeled on a Euclidean space over the complex field and for which all the transition maps are holomorphic . 
 
 While there is a meaningful notion of a C k atlas, there is no distinct notion of a C k manifold other than C 0 (continuous maps: a topological manifold) and C ∞ (smooth maps: a smooth manifold), because every C k -structure with k &gt; 0, there is a unique C k -equivalent C ∞ -structure (every C k -structure is uniquely smoothable ) – a result of Whitney (and further, two C k atlases that are equivalent to a single C ∞ atlas are equivalent as C k atlases, so two distinct C k atlases do not collide); see Differential structure: Existence and uniqueness theorems for details. Thus one uses the terms "differentiable manifold" and "smooth manifold" interchangeably. This is in stark contrast to C k maps, where there are meaningful differences for different k. For example, the Nash embedding theorem states that any manifold can be C k isometrically embedded in Euclidean space R N – for any 1 ≤ k ≤ ∞ there is a sufficiently large N , but N depends on k . 
 On the other hand, complex manifolds are significantly more restrictive. As an example, Chow's theorem states that any projective complex manifold is in fact a projective variety – it has an algebraic structure.

 Charts on a manifold 
 
 An atlas on a topological space X is a collection of pairs {( U α ,φ α )} called charts , where the U α are open sets that cover X , and for each index α 
 
 
 
 is a homeomorphism of U α onto an open subset of n -dimensional real space. The transition maps of the atlas are the functions 
 
 
 
 Every topological manifold has an atlas. A C k -atlas is an atlas whose transition maps are C k . A topological manifold has a C 0 -atlas and in general a C k -manifold has a C k -atlas. A continuous atlas is a C 0 atlas, a smooth atlas is a C ∞ atlas and an analytic atlas is a C ω atlas. If the atlas is at least C 1 , it is also called a differential structure or differentiable structure . A holomorphic atlas is an atlas whose underlying Euclidean space is defined on the complex field and whose transition maps are biholomorphic . 
 [ edit ] Compatible atlases 
 Different atlases can give rise to, in essence, the same manifold. The circle can be mapped by two coordinate charts, but if the domains of these charts are changed slightly a different atlas for the same manifold is obtained. These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. It can happen that the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as smooth as those of the constituent atlases. If C k atlases can be combined to form a C k atlas, then they are called compatible. Compatibility of atlases is an equivalence relation ; by combining all the atlases in an equivalence class , a maximal atlas can be constructed. Each C k atlas belongs to a unique maximal C k atlas. 
 [ edit ] Alternative definitions 
 [ edit ] Pseudogroups 
 The notion of a pseudogroup [ 5 ] provides a flexible generalization of atlases in order to allow a variety of different structures to be defined on manifolds in a uniform way. A pseudogroup consists of a topological space S and a collection Γ consisting of homeomorphisms from open subsets of S to other open subsets of S such that 
 
 If f ∈ Γ, and U is an open subset of the domain of f , then the restriction f | U is also in Γ. 
 If f is a homeomorphism from a union of open subsets of S , , to an open subset of S , then f ∈ Γ provided for every i . 
 For every open U ⊂ S , the identity transformation of U is in Γ. 
 If f ∈ Γ, then f −1 ∈ Γ. 
 The composition of two elements of Γ is in Γ. 
 
 These last three conditions are analogous to the definition of a group . Note that Γ need not be a group, however, since the functions are not globally defined on S . For example, the collection of all local C k diffeomorphisms on R n form a pseudogroup. All biholomorphisms between open sets in C n form a pseudogroup. More examples include: orientation preserving maps of R n , symplectomorphisms , Möbius transformations , affine transformations , and so on. Thus a wide variety of function classes determine pseudogroups. 
 An atlas ( U i , φ i ) of homeomorphisms φ i from U i ⊂ M to open subsets of a topological space S is said to be compatible with a pseudogroup Γ provided that the transition functions φ j o φ i −1 : φ i ( U i ∩ U j ) → φ j ( U i ∩ U j ) are all in Γ. 
 A differentiable manifold is then an atlas compatible with the pseudogroup of C k functions on R n . A complex manifold is an atlas compatible with the biholomorphic functions on open sets in C n . And so forth. Thus pseudogroups provide a single framework in which to describe many structures on manifolds of importance to differential geometry and topology. 
 [ edit ] Structure sheaf 
 Sometimes it can be useful to use an alternative approach to endow a manifold with a C k -structure. Here k = 1, 2, ..., ∞, or ω for real analytic manifolds. Instead of considering coordinate charts, it is possible to start with functions defined on the manifold itself. The structure sheaf of M , denoted C k , is a sort of functor that defines, for each open set U ⊂ M , an algebra C k ( U ) of continuous functions U → R . A structure sheaf C k is said to give M the structure of a C k manifold of dimension n provided that, for any p ∈ M , there exists a neighborhood U of p and n functions x 1 ,..., x n ∈ C k ( U ) such that the map f = ( x 1 , ..., x n ): U → R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n , and such that C k | U is the pullback of the sheaf of k -times continuously differentiable functions on R n . [ 6 ] 
 In particular, this latter condition means that any function h in C k ( V ), for V , can be written uniquely as h ( x ) = H ( x 1 ( x ),..., x n ( x )), where H is a k -times differentiable function on f ( V ) (an open set in R n ). Thus, the sheaf-theoretic viewpoint is that the functions on a differentiable manifold can be expressed in local coordinates as differentiable functions on R n , and a fortiori this is sufficient to characterize the differential structure on the manifold. 
 [ edit ] Sheaves of local rings 
 A similar, but more technical, approach to defining differentiable manifolds can be formulated using the notion of a ringed space . This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry , but uses local rings of the germs of differentiable functions. It is especially popular in the context of complex manifolds. 
 We begin by describing the basic structure sheaf on R n . If U is an open set in R n , let 
 
 O ( U ) = C k ( U , R ) 
 
 consist of all real-valued k -times continuously differentiable functions on U . As U varies, this determines a sheaf of rings on R n . The stalk O p for p ∈ R n consists of germs of functions near p , and is an algebra over R . In particular, this is a local ring whose unique maximal ideal consists of those functions that vanish at p . The pair ( R n , O ) is an example of a locally ringed space : it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf whose stalks are each local rings. 
 A differentiable manifold (of class C k ) consists of a pair ( M , O M ) where M is a second countable Hausdorff space , and O M is a sheaf of local R -algebras defined on M , such that the locally ringed space ( M , O M ) is locally isomorphic to ( R n , O ). In this way, differentiable manifolds can be thought of as schemes modelled on R n . This means that, [ 7 ] for each point p ∈ M , there is a neighborhood U of p , and a pair of functions ( f , f # ) where 
 
 f : U → f ( U ) ⊂ R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n . 
 f # : O | f ( U ) → f * ( O M | U ) is an isomorphism of sheaves. 
 The localization of f # is an isomorphism of local rings 
 
 
 
 
 f # p : O f ( p ) → O M , p . 
 
 
 
 There are a number of important motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. First, there is no a priori reason that the model space needs to be R n . For example (in particular in algebraic geometry ), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers C n equipped with the sheaf of holomorphic functions (thus arriving at the spaces of complex analytic geometry ), or the sheaf of polynomials (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex algebraic geometry). In broad terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see topos theory ). Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. The analog of a coordinate system is the pair ( f , f # ), but these merely quantify the idea of local isomorphism rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). Third, the sheaf O M is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions as a consequence of the construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). Hence it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see synthetic differential geometry ). 
 A final advantage of this approach is that it allows for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology. 
 
 The cotangent space at a point is I p / I p 2 , where I p is the maximal ideal of the stalk O M , p . 
 In general, the entire cotangent bundle can be obtained by a related technique (see cotangent bundle for details). 
 Taylor series (and jets ) can be approached in a coordinate-independent manner using the I p -adic filtration on O M , p . 
 The tangent bundle (or more precisely its sheaf of sections) can be identified with the sheaf of morphisms of O M into the ring of dual numbers . 
 
 [ edit ] Differentiable functions 
 A real valued function f on an n -dimensional differentiable manifold M is called differentiable at a point p ∈ M if it is differentiable in any coordinate chart defined around p . In more precise terms, if ( U , φ) is a chart where U is an open set in M containing p and φ: U → R n is the map defining the chart, then f is differentiable if and only if 
 
 
 
 is differentiable at φ( p ). The definition of differentiability depends on the choice of chart at p ; in general there will be many available charts. However, it follows from the chain rule applied to the transition functions between one chart and another that if f is differentiable in any particular chart at p , then it is differentiable in all charts at p . Analogous considerations apply to defining C k functions, smooth functions, and analytic functions. 
 [ edit ] Differentiation of functions 
 There are various ways to define the derivative of a function on a differentiable manifold, the most fundamental of which is the directional derivative . The definition of the directional derivative is complicated by the fact that a manifold will lack a suitable affine structure with which to define vectors . The directional derivative therefore looks at curves in the manifold instead of vectors. 
 [ edit ] Directional differentiation 
 Given a real valued function f on an m dimensional differentiable manifold M , the directional derivative of f at a point p in M is defined as follows. Suppose that γ( t ) is a curve in M with γ(0) = p , which is differentiable in the sense that its composition with any chart is a differentiable curve in R m . Then the directional derivative of f at p along γ is 
 
 
 
 If γ 1 and γ 2 are two curves such that γ 1 (0) = γ 2 (0) = p , and in any coordinate chart φ, 
 
 
 
 then, by the chain rule, f has the same directional derivative at p along γ 1 as along γ 2 . This means that the directional derivative depends only on the tangent vector of the curve at p . Thus the more abstract definition of directional differentiation adapted to the case of differentiable manifolds ultimately captures the intuitive features of directional differentiation in an affine space. 
 [ edit ] Tangent vectors and the differential 
 A tangent vector at p ∈ M is an equivalence class of differentiable curves γ with γ(0) = p , modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact between the curves. Therefore, 
 
 
 
 in every coordinate chart φ . Therefore, the equivalence classes are curves through p with a prescribed velocity vector at p . The collection of all tangent vectors at p forms a vector space : the tangent space to M at p , denoted T p M . 
 If X is a tangent vector at p and f a differentiable function defined near p , then differentiating f along any curve in the equivalence class defining X gives a well-defined directional derivative along X : 
 
 
 
 Once again, the chain rule establishes that this is independent of the freedom in selecting γ from the equivalence class, since any curve with the same first order contact will yield the same directional derivative. 
 If the function f is fixed, then the mapping 
 
 
 
 is a linear functional on the tangent space. This linear functional is often denoted by df ( p ) and is called the differential of f at p : 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] Partitions of unity 
 One of the topological features of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is that it admits partitions of unity . This distinguishes the differential structure on a manifold from stronger structures (such as analytic and holomorphic structures) that in general fail to have partitions of unity. 
 Suppose that M is a manifold of class C k , where 0 ≤ k ≤ ∞. Let { U α } be an open covering of M . Then a partition of unity subordinate to the cover { U α } is a collection of real-valued C k functions φ i on M satisfying the following conditions: 
 
 The supports of the φ i are compact and locally finite ; 
 The support of φ i is completely contained in U α for some α; 
 The φ i sum to one at each point of M : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (Note that this last condition is actually a finite sum at each point because of the local finiteness of the supports of the φ i .) 
 Every open covering of a C k manifold M has a C k partition of unity. This allows for certain constructions from the topology of C k functions on R n to be carried over to the category of differentiable manifolds. In particular, it is possible to discuss integration by choosing a partition of unity subordinate to a particular coordinate atlas, and carrying out the integration in each chart of R n . Partitions of unity therefore allow for certain other kinds of function spaces to be considered: for instance L p spaces , Sobolev spaces , and other kinds of spaces that require integration. 
 [ edit ] Differentiability of mappings between manifolds 
 Suppose M and N are two differentiable manifolds with dimensions m and n , respectively, and f is a function from M to N . Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces we know what it means for f to be continuous. But what does " f is C k ( M , N )" mean for k &#160;≥&#160;1? We know what that means when f is a function between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose f with a chart of M and a chart of N such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to M to N to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be C k ( R m , R n ). We define " f is C k ( M , N )" to mean that all such compositions of f with charts are C k ( R m , R n ). Once again the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on M and N are selected. However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. If M or N is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one. 
 [ edit ] Algebra of scalars 
 For a C k manifold M , the set of real-valued C k functions on the manifold forms an algebra under pointwise addition and multiplication, called the algebra of scalar fields or simply the algebra of scalars . This algebra has the constant function 1 as the multiplicative identity, and is a differentiable analog of the ring of regular functions in algebraic geometry. 
 It is possible to reconstruct a manifold from its algebra of scalars, first as a set, but also as a topological space – this is an application of the Banach–Stone theorem , and is more formally known as the spectrum of a C*-algebra . First, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of M and the algebra homomorphisms φ: C k ( M ) → R , as such a homomorphism φ corresponds a codimension one ideal in C k ( M ) (namely the kernel of φ ), which is necessarily a maximal ideal. On the converse, every maximal ideal in this algebra is an ideal of functions vanishing at a single point, which demonstrates that MSpec (the Max Spec) of C k ( M ) recovers M as a point set, though in fact it recovers M as a topological space. 
 One can define various geometric structures algebraically in terms of the algebra of scalars, and these definitions often generalize to algebraic geometry (interpreting rings geometrically) and operator theory (interpreting Banach spaces geometrically). For example, the tangent bundle to M can be defined as the derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on M . 
 This "algebraization" of a manifold (replacing a geometric object with an algebra) leads to the notion of a C*-algebra – a commutative C*-algebra being precisely the ring of scalars of a manifold, by Banach–Stone, and allows one to consider non commutative C*-algebras as non-commutative generalizations of manifolds. This is the basis of the field of noncommutative geometry .

 [ edit ] Bundles 
 [ edit ] Tangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tangent bundle . 
 The tangent space of a point consists of the possible directional derivatives at that point, and has the same dimension n as does the manifold. For a set of (non-singular) coordinates x k local to the point, the coordinate derivatives typically define a basis of the tangent space. The collection of tangent spaces at all points can in turn be made into a manifold, the tangent bundle , whose dimension is 2 n . The tangent bundle is where tangent vectors lie, and is itself a differentiable manifold. The Lagrangian is a function on the tangent bundle. One can also define the tangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets from R (the real line ) to M . 
 One may construct an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on U α × R n , where U α denotes one of the charts in the atlas for M . Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts U α . The transition maps on this atlas are defined from the transition maps on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class. 
 [ edit ] Cotangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see cotangent bundle . 
 The dual space of a vector space is the set of real valued linear functions on the vector space. The cotangent space at a point is the dual of the tangent space at that point, and the cotangent bundle is the collection of all cotangent spaces. 
 Like the tangent bundle the cotangent bundle is again a differentiable manifold. The Hamiltonian is a scalar on the cotangent bundle. The total space of a cotangent bundle has the structure of a symplectic manifold . Cotangent vectors are sometimes called covectors . One can also define the cotangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets of functions from M to R . 
 Elements of the cotangent space can be thought of as infinitesimal displacements: if f is a differentiable function we can define at each point p a cotangent vector df p , which sends a tangent vector X p to the derivative of f associated with X p . However, not every covector field can be expressed this way. Those that can are referred to as exact differentials . For a given set of local coordinates x k the differentials dx k 
p form a basis of the cotangent space at p . 
 [ edit ] Tensor bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tensor bundle . 
 The tensor bundle is the direct sum of all tensor products of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Each element of the bundle is a tensor field , which can act as a multilinear operator on vector fields, or on other tensor fields. 
 The tensor bundle cannot be a differentiable manifold, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an algebra over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks are referred to as covariant and contravariant ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively. 
 [ edit ] Frame bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see frame bundle . 
 A frame (or, in more precise terms, a tangent frame) is an ordered basis of particular tangent space. Likewise, a tangent frame is a linear isomorphism of R n to this tangent space. A moving tangent frame is an ordered list of vector fields that give a basis at every point of their domain. One may also regard a moving frame as a section of the frame bundle F( M ), a GL( n , R ) principal bundle made up of the set of all frames over M . The frame bundle is useful because tensor fields on M can be regarded as equivariant vector-valued functions on F( M ). 
 [ edit ] Jet bundles 
 For more details on this topic, see jet bundle . 
 On a manifold that is sufficiently smooth, various kinds of jet bundles can also be considered. The (first-order) tangent bundle of a manifold is the collection of curves in the manifold modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact . By analogy, the k -th order tangent bundle is the collection of curves modulo the relation of k -th order contact. Likewise, the cotangent bundle is the bundle of 1-jets of functions on the manifold: the k -jet bundle is the bundle of their k -jets. These and other examples of the general idea of jet bundles play a significant role in the study of differential operators on manifolds. 
 The notion of a frame also generalizes to the case of higher-order jets. Define a k -th order frame to be the k -jet of a diffeomorphism from R n to M . [ 8 ] The collection of all k -th order frames, F k ( M ), is a principle G k bundle over M , where G k is the group of k -jets ; i.e., the group made up of k -jets of diffeomorphisms of R n that fix the origin. Note that GL( n , R ) is naturally isomorphic to G 1 , and a subgroup of every G k , k ≥ 2. In particular, a section of F 2 ( M ) gives the frame components of a connection on M . Thus, the quotient bundle F 2 ( M )/ GL( n , R ) is the bundle of linear connections over M . 
 [ edit ] Calculus on manifolds 
 Many of the techniques from multivariate calculus also apply, mutatis mutandis , to differentiable manifolds. One can define the directional derivative of a differentiable function along a tangent vector to the manifold, for instance, and this leads to a means of generalizing the total derivative of a function: the differential. From the perspective of calculus, the derivative of a function on a manifold behaves in much the same way as the ordinary derivative of a function defined on a Euclidean space, at least locally . For example, there are versions of the implicit and inverse function theorems for such functions. 
 There are, however, important differences in the calculus of vector fields (and tensor fields in general). In brief, the directional derivative of a vector field is not well-defined, or at least not defined in a straightforward manner. Several generalizations of the derivative of a vector field (or tensor field) do exist, and capture certain formal features of differentiation in Euclidean spaces. The chief among these are: 
 
 The Lie derivative , which is uniquely defined by the differential structure, but fails to satisfy some of the usual features of directional differentiation. 
 An affine connection , which is not uniquely defined, but generalizes in a more complete manner the features of ordinary directional differentiation. Because an affine connection is not unique, it is an additional piece of data that must be specified on the manifold. 
 
 Ideas from integral calculus also carry over to differential manifolds. These are naturally expressed in the language of exterior calculus and differential forms . The fundamental theorems of integral calculus in several variables — namely Green's theorem , the divergence theorem , and Stokes' theorem — generalize to a theorem (also called Stokes' theorem ) relating the exterior derivative and integration over submanifolds . 
 [ edit ] Differential calculus of functions 
 Differentiable functions between two manifolds are needed in order to formulate suitable notions of submanifolds , and other related concepts. If f : M → N is a differentiable function from a differentiable manifold M of dimension m to another differentiable manifold N of dimension n , then the differential of f is a mapping df : T M → T N . At each point of M , this is a linear transformation from one tangent space to another: 
 
 
 
 The rank of f at p is the rank of this linear transformation. 
 Usually the rank of a function is a pointwise property. However, if the function has maximal rank, then the rank will remain constant in a neighborhood of a point. A differentiable function "usually" has maximal rank, in a precise sense given by Sard's theorem . Functions of maximal rank at a point are called immersions and submersions : 
 
 If m ≤ n , and f &#160;: M → N has rank m at p ∈ M , then f is called an immersion at p . If f is an immersion at all points of M and is a homeomorphism onto its image, then f is an embedding . Embeddings formalize the notion of M being a submanifold of N . In general, an embedding is an immersion without self-intersections and other sorts of non-local topological irregularities. 
 
 
 If m ≥ n , and f : M → N has rank n at p ∈ M , then f is called a submersion at p . The implicit function theorem states that if f is a submersion at p , then M is locally a product of N and R m − n near p . In formal terms, there exist coordinates ( y 1 , ..., y n ) in a neighborhood of f ( p ) in N , and m − n functions x 1 ,..., x m − n defined in a neighborhood of p in M such that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is a system of local coordinates of M in a neighborhood of p . Submersions form the foundation of the theory of fibrations and fibre bundles . 
 
 [ edit ] Lie derivative 
 A Lie derivative , named after Sophus Lie , is a derivation on the algebra of tensor fields over a manifold M . The vector space of all Lie derivatives on M forms an infinite dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket [ disambiguation needed ] defined by 
 
 
 
 The Lie derivatives are represented by vector fields , as infinitesimal generators of flows ( active diffeomorphisms ) on M . Looking at it the other way round, the group of diffeomorphisms of M has the associated Lie algebra structure, of Lie derivatives, in a way directly analogous to the Lie group theory. 
 [ edit ] Exterior calculus 
 For more details on this topic, see differential form . 
 The exterior calculus allows for a generalization of the gradient , divergence and curl operators. 
 The bundle of differential forms , at each point, consists of all totally antisymmetric multilinear maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into n -forms for each n at most equal to the dimension of the manifold; an n -form is an n -variable form, also called a form of degree n . The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an n -form is a tensor with cotangent rank n and tangent rank 0. But not every such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric. 
 [ edit ] Exterior derivative 
 There is a map from scalars to covectors called the exterior derivative 
 
 
 
 such that 
 
 
 
 This map is the one that relates covectors to infinitesimal displacements, mentioned above; some covectors are the exterior derivatives of scalar functions. It can be generalized into a map from the n -forms onto the ( n +1)-forms. Applying this derivative twice will produce a zero form. Forms with zero derivative are called closed forms, while forms that are themselves exterior derivatives are known as exact forms. 
 The space of differential forms at a point is the archetypal example of an exterior algebra ; thus it possesses a wedge product, mapping a k -form and l -form to a ( k + l )-form. The exterior derivative extends to this algebra, and satisfies a version of the product rule : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From the differential forms and the exterior derivative, one can define the de Rham cohomology of the manifold. The rank n cohomology group is the quotient group of the closed forms by the exact forms. 
 [ edit ] Topology of differentiable manifolds 
 [ edit ] Relationship with topological manifolds 
 Every topological manifold in dimension 1, 2, or 3 has a unique differential structure (up to diffeomorphism); thus the concepts of topological and differentiable manifold are distinct only in higher dimensions. It is known that in each higher dimension, there are some topological manifolds with no smooth structure, and some with multiple non-diffeomorphic structures. 
 The existence of non-smoothable manifolds was proven by Kervaire (1960 ), and later explained in the context of Donaldson's theorem (compare Hilbert's fifth problem ); [ 9 ] a good example of a non-smoothable manifold is the E 8 manifold . 
 The classic example of manifolds with multiple incompatible structures are the exotic 7-spheres of John Milnor . [ 10 ] 
 [ edit ] Classification 
 Every second-countable 1-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of countably many copies of R (the real line ) and S (the circle ); the only connected examples are R and S , and of these only S is compact. In higher dimensions, classification theory normally focuses only on compact connected manifolds. 
 For a classification of 2-manifolds, see surface : in particular compact connected oriented 2-manifolds are classified by their genus, which is a nonnegative integer. 
 A classification of 3-manifolds follows in principle from the geometrization of 3-manifolds and various recognition results for geometrizable 3-manifolds, such as Mostow rigidity and Sela's algorithm for the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups. [ 11 ] 
 The classification of n -manifolds for n greater than three is known to be impossible, even up to homotopy equivalence . Given any finitely presented group, one can construct a closed 4-manifold having that group as fundamental group. Since there is no algorithm to decide the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups, there is no algorithm to decide if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. Since the previously described construction results in a class of 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic if and only if their groups are isomorphic, the homeomorphism problem for 4-manifolds is undecidable . In addition, since even recognizing the trivial group is undecidable, it is not even possible in general to decide if a manifold has trivial fundamental group, i.e. is simply connected . 
 Simply connected 4-manifolds have been classified up to homeomorphism by Freedman using the intersection form and Kirby–Siebenmann invariant . Smooth 4-manifold theory is known to be much more complicated, as the exotic smooth structures on R 4 demonstrate. 
 However, the situation becomes more tractable for simply connected smooth manifolds of dimension ≥ 5, where the h-cobordism theorem can be used to reduce the classification to a classification up to homotopy equivalence, and surgery theory can be applied. [ 12 ] This has been carried out to provide an explicit classification of simply connected 5-manifolds by Dennis Barden.

 A Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold on which the tangent spaces are equipped with inner products in a differentiable fashion. The inner product structure is given in the form of a symmetric 2-tensor called the Riemannian metric . This metric can be used to interconvert vectors and covectors, and to define a rank 4 Riemann curvature tensor . On a Riemannian manifold one has notions of length, volume, and angle. Any differentiable manifold can be given a Riemannian structure. 
 A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a variant of Riemannian manifold where the metric tensor is allowed to have an indefinite signature (as opposed to a positive-definite one). Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (3, 1) are important in general relativity . Not every differentiable manifold can be given a pseudo-Riemannian structure; there are topological restrictions on doing so. 
 A Finsler manifold is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold, in which the inner product is replaced with a vector norm ; this allows the definition of length, but not angle. 
 [ edit ] Symplectic manifolds 
 For more details on this topic, see symplectic manifold . 
 A symplectic manifold is a manifold equipped with a closed , nondegenerate 2-form . This condition forces symplectic manifolds to be even-dimensional. Cotangent bundles, which arise as phase spaces in Hamiltonian mechanics , are the motivating example, but many compact manifolds also have symplectic structure. All orientable surfaces embedded in Euclidean space have a symplectic structure , the signed area form on each tangent space induced by the ambient Euclidean inner product . [ note 1 ] Every Riemann surface is an example of such a surface, and hence a symplectic manifold , when considered as a real manifold . 
 [ edit ] Lie groups 
 For more details on this topic, see Lie group . 
 A Lie group is C ∞ manifold that also carries a group structure whose product and inversion operations are smooth as maps of manifolds. These objects arise naturally in describing symmetries. 
 [ edit ] Generalizations 
 The category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps lacks certain desirable properties, and people have tried to generalize smooth manifolds in order to rectify this. Diffeological spaces use a different notion of chart known as a "plot". Frölicher spaces and orbifolds are other attempts. 
 A rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piece-wise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.

 ^  This form is clearly nondegenerate, and it must be closed because it is top-dimensional with respect to the surface ; this reflects the exceptional isomorphism of Lie groups Sp(2, R ) ≅ SL(2, R ) between the symplectic group (corresponding to symplectic structure) and the special linear group (corresponding to orientable structure). Note that a symplectic structure requires an additional integrability condition, beyond this isomorphism of groups: it is not just a G-structure .

 A nondifferentiable atlas of charts for the globe. The results of calculus may not be compatible between charts if the atlas is not differentiable. In the middle chart the Tropic of Cancer is a smooth curve, whereas in the first it has a sharp corner. The notion of a differentiable manifold refines that of a manifold by requiring the functions that transform between charts to be differentiable. 
 
 
 In mathematics, a differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus . Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts , also known as an atlas. One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable ), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart. 
 In formal terms, a differentiable manifold is a topological manifold with a globally defined differential structure . Any topological manifold can be given a differential structure locally by using the homeomorphisms in its atlas and the standard differential structure on a linear space. To induce a global differential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the homeomorphisms, their composition on chart intersections in the atlas must be differentiable functions on the corresponding linear space. In other words, where the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are required to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every chart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various charts to one another are called transition maps. 
 Differentiability means different things in different contexts including: continuously differentiable , k times differentiable, and holomorphic . Furthermore, the ability to induce such a differential structure on an abstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to spaces without global coordinate systems. A differential structure allows one to define the globally differentiable tangent space , differentiable functions, and differentiable tensor and vector fields. Differentiable manifolds are very important in physics . Special kinds of differentiable manifolds form the basis for physical theories such as classical mechanics , general relativity , and Yang–Mills theory. It is possible to develop a calculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical machinery as the exterior calculus. The study of calculus on differentiable manifolds is known as differential geometry.

 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of manifolds and varieties 
 The emergence of differential geometry as a distinct discipline is generally credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann . Riemann first described manifolds in his famous habilitation lecture [ 1 ] before the faculty at Göttingen. He motivated the idea of a manifold by an intuitive process of varying a given object in a new direction, and presciently described the role of coordinate systems and charts in subsequent formal developments: 
 
 Having constructed the notion of a manifoldness of n dimensions, and found that its true character consists in the property that the determination of position in it may be reduced to n determinations of magnitude, ... – B. Riemann 
 
 The works of physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell [ citation needed ] , and mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita [ 2 ] led to the development of tensor analysis and the notion of covariance , which identifies an intrinsic geometric property as one that is invariant with respect to coordinate transformations . These ideas found a key application in Einstein 's theory of general relativity and its underlying equivalence principle . A modern definition of a 2-dimensional manifold was given by Hermann Weyl in his 1913 book on Riemann surfaces . [ 3 ] The widely accepted general definition of a manifold in terms of an atlas is due to Hassler Whitney . [ 4 ] 
 [ edit ] Definition 
 A presentation of a topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a linear space, by a collection (called an atlas ) of homeomorphisms called charts . The composition of one chart with the inverse of another chart is a function called a transition map , and defines a homeomorphism of an open subset of the linear space onto another open subset of the linear space. This formalizes the notion of "patching together pieces of a space to make a manifold" – the manifold produced also contains the data of how it has been patched together. However, different atlases (patchings) may produce "the same" manifold; a manifold does not come with a preferred atlas. And, thus, one defines a topological manifold to be a space as above with an equivalence class of atlases, where one defines equivalence of atlases below. 
 There are a number of different types of differentiable manifolds, depending on the precise differentiability requirements on the transition functions. Some common examples include the following. 
 
 A differentiable manifold is a topological manifold equipped with an equivalence class of atlases whose transition maps are all differentiable. In broader terms, a C k -manifold is a topological manifold with an atlas whose transition maps are all k -times continuously differentiable. 
 
 
 A smooth manifold or C ∞ -manifold is a differentiable manifold for which all the transition maps are smooth . That is, derivatives of all orders exist; so it is a C k -manifold for all k . An equivalence class of such atlases is said to be a smooth structure . 
 
 
 An analytic manifold , or C ω -manifold is a smooth manifold with the additional condition that each transition map is analytic : the Taylor expansion is absolutely convergent and equals the function on some open ball. 
 
 
 A complex manifold is a topological space modeled on a Euclidean space over the complex field and for which all the transition maps are holomorphic . 
 
 While there is a meaningful notion of a C k atlas, there is no distinct notion of a C k manifold other than C 0 (continuous maps: a topological manifold) and C ∞ (smooth maps: a smooth manifold), because every C k -structure with k &gt; 0, there is a unique C k -equivalent C ∞ -structure (every C k -structure is uniquely smoothable ) – a result of Whitney (and further, two C k atlases that are equivalent to a single C ∞ atlas are equivalent as C k atlases, so two distinct C k atlases do not collide); see Differential structure: Existence and uniqueness theorems for details. Thus one uses the terms "differentiable manifold" and "smooth manifold" interchangeably. This is in stark contrast to C k maps, where there are meaningful differences for different k. For example, the Nash embedding theorem states that any manifold can be C k isometrically embedded in Euclidean space R N – for any 1 ≤ k ≤ ∞ there is a sufficiently large N , but N depends on k . 
 On the other hand, complex manifolds are significantly more restrictive. As an example, Chow's theorem states that any projective complex manifold is in fact a projective variety – it has an algebraic structure. 
 [ edit ] Atlases 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  
 
 Charts on a manifold 
 
 An atlas on a topological space X is a collection of pairs {( U α ,φ α )} called charts , where the U α are open sets that cover X , and for each index α 
 
 
 
 is a homeomorphism of U α onto an open subset of n -dimensional real space. The transition maps of the atlas are the functions 
 
 
 
 Every topological manifold has an atlas. A C k -atlas is an atlas whose transition maps are C k . A topological manifold has a C 0 -atlas and in general a C k -manifold has a C k -atlas. A continuous atlas is a C 0 atlas, a smooth atlas is a C ∞ atlas and an analytic atlas is a C ω atlas. If the atlas is at least C 1 , it is also called a differential structure or differentiable structure . A holomorphic atlas is an atlas whose underlying Euclidean space is defined on the complex field and whose transition maps are biholomorphic . 
 [ edit ] Compatible atlases 
 Different atlases can give rise to, in essence, the same manifold. The circle can be mapped by two coordinate charts, but if the domains of these charts are changed slightly a different atlas for the same manifold is obtained. These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. It can happen that the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as smooth as those of the constituent atlases. If C k atlases can be combined to form a C k atlas, then they are called compatible. Compatibility of atlases is an equivalence relation ; by combining all the atlases in an equivalence class , a maximal atlas can be constructed. Each C k atlas belongs to a unique maximal C k atlas. 
 [ edit ] Alternative definitions 
 [ edit ] Pseudogroups 
 The notion of a pseudogroup [ 5 ] provides a flexible generalization of atlases in order to allow a variety of different structures to be defined on manifolds in a uniform way. A pseudogroup consists of a topological space S and a collection Γ consisting of homeomorphisms from open subsets of S to other open subsets of S such that 
 
 If f ∈ Γ, and U is an open subset of the domain of f , then the restriction f | U is also in Γ. 
 If f is a homeomorphism from a union of open subsets of S , , to an open subset of S , then f ∈ Γ provided for every i . 
 For every open U ⊂ S , the identity transformation of U is in Γ. 
 If f ∈ Γ, then f −1 ∈ Γ. 
 The composition of two elements of Γ is in Γ. 
 
 These last three conditions are analogous to the definition of a group . Note that Γ need not be a group, however, since the functions are not globally defined on S . For example, the collection of all local C k diffeomorphisms on R n form a pseudogroup. All biholomorphisms between open sets in C n form a pseudogroup. More examples include: orientation preserving maps of R n , symplectomorphisms , Möbius transformations , affine transformations , and so on. Thus a wide variety of function classes determine pseudogroups. 
 An atlas ( U i , φ i ) of homeomorphisms φ i from U i ⊂ M to open subsets of a topological space S is said to be compatible with a pseudogroup Γ provided that the transition functions φ j o φ i −1 : φ i ( U i ∩ U j ) → φ j ( U i ∩ U j ) are all in Γ. 
 A differentiable manifold is then an atlas compatible with the pseudogroup of C k functions on R n . A complex manifold is an atlas compatible with the biholomorphic functions on open sets in C n . And so forth. Thus pseudogroups provide a single framework in which to describe many structures on manifolds of importance to differential geometry and topology. 
 [ edit ] Structure sheaf 
 Sometimes it can be useful to use an alternative approach to endow a manifold with a C k -structure. Here k = 1, 2, ..., ∞, or ω for real analytic manifolds. Instead of considering coordinate charts, it is possible to start with functions defined on the manifold itself. The structure sheaf of M , denoted C k , is a sort of functor that defines, for each open set U ⊂ M , an algebra C k ( U ) of continuous functions U → R . A structure sheaf C k is said to give M the structure of a C k manifold of dimension n provided that, for any p ∈ M , there exists a neighborhood U of p and n functions x 1 ,..., x n ∈ C k ( U ) such that the map f = ( x 1 , ..., x n ): U → R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n , and such that C k | U is the pullback of the sheaf of k -times continuously differentiable functions on R n . [ 6 ] 
 In particular, this latter condition means that any function h in C k ( V ), for V , can be written uniquely as h ( x ) = H ( x 1 ( x ),..., x n ( x )), where H is a k -times differentiable function on f ( V ) (an open set in R n ). Thus, the sheaf-theoretic viewpoint is that the functions on a differentiable manifold can be expressed in local coordinates as differentiable functions on R n , and a fortiori this is sufficient to characterize the differential structure on the manifold. 
 [ edit ] Sheaves of local rings 
 A similar, but more technical, approach to defining differentiable manifolds can be formulated using the notion of a ringed space . This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry , but uses local rings of the germs of differentiable functions. It is especially popular in the context of complex manifolds. 
 We begin by describing the basic structure sheaf on R n . If U is an open set in R n , let 
 
 O ( U ) = C k ( U , R ) 
 
 consist of all real-valued k -times continuously differentiable functions on U . As U varies, this determines a sheaf of rings on R n . The stalk O p for p ∈ R n consists of germs of functions near p , and is an algebra over R . In particular, this is a local ring whose unique maximal ideal consists of those functions that vanish at p . The pair ( R n , O ) is an example of a locally ringed space : it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf whose stalks are each local rings. 
 A differentiable manifold (of class C k ) consists of a pair ( M , O M ) where M is a second countable Hausdorff space , and O M is a sheaf of local R -algebras defined on M , such that the locally ringed space ( M , O M ) is locally isomorphic to ( R n , O ). In this way, differentiable manifolds can be thought of as schemes modelled on R n . This means that, [ 7 ] for each point p ∈ M , there is a neighborhood U of p , and a pair of functions ( f , f # ) where 
 
 f : U → f ( U ) ⊂ R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n . 
 f # : O | f ( U ) → f * ( O M | U ) is an isomorphism of sheaves. 
 The localization of f # is an isomorphism of local rings 
 
 
 
 
 f # p : O f ( p ) → O M , p . 
 
 
 
 There are a number of important motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. First, there is no a priori reason that the model space needs to be R n . For example (in particular in algebraic geometry ), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers C n equipped with the sheaf of holomorphic functions (thus arriving at the spaces of complex analytic geometry ), or the sheaf of polynomials (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex algebraic geometry). In broad terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see topos theory ). Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. The analog of a coordinate system is the pair ( f , f # ), but these merely quantify the idea of local isomorphism rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). Third, the sheaf O M is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions as a consequence of the construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). Hence it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see synthetic differential geometry ). 
 A final advantage of this approach is that it allows for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology. 
 
 The cotangent space at a point is I p / I p 2 , where I p is the maximal ideal of the stalk O M , p . 
 In general, the entire cotangent bundle can be obtained by a related technique (see cotangent bundle for details). 
 Taylor series (and jets ) can be approached in a coordinate-independent manner using the I p -adic filtration on O M , p . 
 The tangent bundle (or more precisely its sheaf of sections) can be identified with the sheaf of morphisms of O M into the ring of dual numbers . 
 
 [ edit ] Differentiable functions 
 A real valued function f on an n -dimensional differentiable manifold M is called differentiable at a point p ∈ M if it is differentiable in any coordinate chart defined around p . In more precise terms, if ( U , φ) is a chart where U is an open set in M containing p and φ: U → R n is the map defining the chart, then f is differentiable if and only if 
 
 
 
 is differentiable at φ( p ). The definition of differentiability depends on the choice of chart at p ; in general there will be many available charts. However, it follows from the chain rule applied to the transition functions between one chart and another that if f is differentiable in any particular chart at p , then it is differentiable in all charts at p . Analogous considerations apply to defining C k functions, smooth functions, and analytic functions. 
 [ edit ] Differentiation of functions 
 There are various ways to define the derivative of a function on a differentiable manifold, the most fundamental of which is the directional derivative . The definition of the directional derivative is complicated by the fact that a manifold will lack a suitable affine structure with which to define vectors . The directional derivative therefore looks at curves in the manifold instead of vectors. 
 [ edit ] Directional differentiation 
 Given a real valued function f on an m dimensional differentiable manifold M , the directional derivative of f at a point p in M is defined as follows. Suppose that γ( t ) is a curve in M with γ(0) = p , which is differentiable in the sense that its composition with any chart is a differentiable curve in R m . Then the directional derivative of f at p along γ is 
 
 
 
 If γ 1 and γ 2 are two curves such that γ 1 (0) = γ 2 (0) = p , and in any coordinate chart φ, 
 
 
 
 then, by the chain rule, f has the same directional derivative at p along γ 1 as along γ 2 . This means that the directional derivative depends only on the tangent vector of the curve at p . Thus the more abstract definition of directional differentiation adapted to the case of differentiable manifolds ultimately captures the intuitive features of directional differentiation in an affine space. 
 [ edit ] Tangent vectors and the differential 
 A tangent vector at p ∈ M is an equivalence class of differentiable curves γ with γ(0) = p , modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact between the curves. Therefore, 
 
 
 
 in every coordinate chart φ . Therefore, the equivalence classes are curves through p with a prescribed velocity vector at p . The collection of all tangent vectors at p forms a vector space : the tangent space to M at p , denoted T p M . 
 If X is a tangent vector at p and f a differentiable function defined near p , then differentiating f along any curve in the equivalence class defining X gives a well-defined directional derivative along X : 
 
 
 
 Once again, the chain rule establishes that this is independent of the freedom in selecting γ from the equivalence class, since any curve with the same first order contact will yield the same directional derivative. 
 If the function f is fixed, then the mapping 
 
 
 
 is a linear functional on the tangent space. This linear functional is often denoted by df ( p ) and is called the differential of f at p : 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] Partitions of unity 
 One of the topological features of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is that it admits partitions of unity . This distinguishes the differential structure on a manifold from stronger structures (such as analytic and holomorphic structures) that in general fail to have partitions of unity. 
 Suppose that M is a manifold of class C k , where 0 ≤ k ≤ ∞. Let { U α } be an open covering of M . Then a partition of unity subordinate to the cover { U α } is a collection of real-valued C k functions φ i on M satisfying the following conditions: 
 
 The supports of the φ i are compact and locally finite ; 
 The support of φ i is completely contained in U α for some α; 
 The φ i sum to one at each point of M : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (Note that this last condition is actually a finite sum at each point because of the local finiteness of the supports of the φ i .) 
 Every open covering of a C k manifold M has a C k partition of unity. This allows for certain constructions from the topology of C k functions on R n to be carried over to the category of differentiable manifolds. In particular, it is possible to discuss integration by choosing a partition of unity subordinate to a particular coordinate atlas, and carrying out the integration in each chart of R n . Partitions of unity therefore allow for certain other kinds of function spaces to be considered: for instance L p spaces , Sobolev spaces , and other kinds of spaces that require integration. 
 [ edit ] Differentiability of mappings between manifolds 
 Suppose M and N are two differentiable manifolds with dimensions m and n , respectively, and f is a function from M to N . Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces we know what it means for f to be continuous. But what does " f is C k ( M , N )" mean for k &#160;≥&#160;1? We know what that means when f is a function between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose f with a chart of M and a chart of N such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to M to N to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be C k ( R m , R n ). We define " f is C k ( M , N )" to mean that all such compositions of f with charts are C k ( R m , R n ). Once again the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on M and N are selected. However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. If M or N is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one. 
 [ edit ] Algebra of scalars 
 For a C k manifold M , the set of real-valued C k functions on the manifold forms an algebra under pointwise addition and multiplication, called the algebra of scalar fields or simply the algebra of scalars . This algebra has the constant function 1 as the multiplicative identity, and is a differentiable analog of the ring of regular functions in algebraic geometry. 
 It is possible to reconstruct a manifold from its algebra of scalars, first as a set, but also as a topological space – this is an application of the Banach–Stone theorem , and is more formally known as the spectrum of a C*-algebra . First, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of M and the algebra homomorphisms φ: C k ( M ) → R , as such a homomorphism φ corresponds a codimension one ideal in C k ( M ) (namely the kernel of φ ), which is necessarily a maximal ideal. On the converse, every maximal ideal in this algebra is an ideal of functions vanishing at a single point, which demonstrates that MSpec (the Max Spec) of C k ( M ) recovers M as a point set, though in fact it recovers M as a topological space. 
 One can define various geometric structures algebraically in terms of the algebra of scalars, and these definitions often generalize to algebraic geometry (interpreting rings geometrically) and operator theory (interpreting Banach spaces geometrically). For example, the tangent bundle to M can be defined as the derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on M . 
 This "algebraization" of a manifold (replacing a geometric object with an algebra) leads to the notion of a C*-algebra – a commutative C*-algebra being precisely the ring of scalars of a manifold, by Banach–Stone, and allows one to consider non commutative C*-algebras as non-commutative generalizations of manifolds. This is the basis of the field of noncommutative geometry .

 [ edit ] Bundles 
 [ edit ] Tangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tangent bundle . 
 The tangent space of a point consists of the possible directional derivatives at that point, and has the same dimension n as does the manifold. For a set of (non-singular) coordinates x k local to the point, the coordinate derivatives typically define a basis of the tangent space. The collection of tangent spaces at all points can in turn be made into a manifold, the tangent bundle , whose dimension is 2 n . The tangent bundle is where tangent vectors lie, and is itself a differentiable manifold. The Lagrangian is a function on the tangent bundle. One can also define the tangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets from R (the real line ) to M . 
 One may construct an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on U α × R n , where U α denotes one of the charts in the atlas for M . Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts U α . The transition maps on this atlas are defined from the transition maps on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class. 
 [ edit ] Cotangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see cotangent bundle . 
 The dual space of a vector space is the set of real valued linear functions on the vector space. The cotangent space at a point is the dual of the tangent space at that point, and the cotangent bundle is the collection of all cotangent spaces. 
 Like the tangent bundle the cotangent bundle is again a differentiable manifold. The Hamiltonian is a scalar on the cotangent bundle. The total space of a cotangent bundle has the structure of a symplectic manifold . Cotangent vectors are sometimes called covectors . One can also define the cotangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets of functions from M to R . 
 Elements of the cotangent space can be thought of as infinitesimal displacements: if f is a differentiable function we can define at each point p a cotangent vector df p , which sends a tangent vector X p to the derivative of f associated with X p . However, not every covector field can be expressed this way. Those that can are referred to as exact differentials . For a given set of local coordinates x k the differentials dx k 
p form a basis of the cotangent space at p . 
 [ edit ] Tensor bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tensor bundle . 
 The tensor bundle is the direct sum of all tensor products of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Each element of the bundle is a tensor field , which can act as a multilinear operator on vector fields, or on other tensor fields. 
 The tensor bundle cannot be a differentiable manifold, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an algebra over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks are referred to as covariant and contravariant ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively. 
 [ edit ] Frame bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see frame bundle . 
 A frame (or, in more precise terms, a tangent frame) is an ordered basis of particular tangent space. Likewise, a tangent frame is a linear isomorphism of R n to this tangent space. A moving tangent frame is an ordered list of vector fields that give a basis at every point of their domain. One may also regard a moving frame as a section of the frame bundle F( M ), a GL( n , R ) principal bundle made up of the set of all frames over M . The frame bundle is useful because tensor fields on M can be regarded as equivariant vector-valued functions on F( M ). 
 [ edit ] Jet bundles 
 For more details on this topic, see jet bundle . 
 On a manifold that is sufficiently smooth, various kinds of jet bundles can also be considered. The (first-order) tangent bundle of a manifold is the collection of curves in the manifold modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact . By analogy, the k -th order tangent bundle is the collection of curves modulo the relation of k -th order contact. Likewise, the cotangent bundle is the bundle of 1-jets of functions on the manifold: the k -jet bundle is the bundle of their k -jets. These and other examples of the general idea of jet bundles play a significant role in the study of differential operators on manifolds. 
 The notion of a frame also generalizes to the case of higher-order jets. Define a k -th order frame to be the k -jet of a diffeomorphism from R n to M . [ 8 ] The collection of all k -th order frames, F k ( M ), is a principle G k bundle over M , where G k is the group of k -jets ; i.e., the group made up of k -jets of diffeomorphisms of R n that fix the origin. Note that GL( n , R ) is naturally isomorphic to G 1 , and a subgroup of every G k , k ≥ 2. In particular, a section of F 2 ( M ) gives the frame components of a connection on M . Thus, the quotient bundle F 2 ( M )/ GL( n , R ) is the bundle of linear connections over M . 
 [ edit ] Calculus on manifolds 
 Many of the techniques from multivariate calculus also apply, mutatis mutandis , to differentiable manifolds. One can define the directional derivative of a differentiable function along a tangent vector to the manifold, for instance, and this leads to a means of generalizing the total derivative of a function: the differential. From the perspective of calculus, the derivative of a function on a manifold behaves in much the same way as the ordinary derivative of a function defined on a Euclidean space, at least locally . For example, there are versions of the implicit and inverse function theorems for such functions. 
 There are, however, important differences in the calculus of vector fields (and tensor fields in general). In brief, the directional derivative of a vector field is not well-defined, or at least not defined in a straightforward manner. Several generalizations of the derivative of a vector field (or tensor field) do exist, and capture certain formal features of differentiation in Euclidean spaces. The chief among these are: 
 
 The Lie derivative , which is uniquely defined by the differential structure, but fails to satisfy some of the usual features of directional differentiation. 
 An affine connection , which is not uniquely defined, but generalizes in a more complete manner the features of ordinary directional differentiation. Because an affine connection is not unique, it is an additional piece of data that must be specified on the manifold. 
 
 Ideas from integral calculus also carry over to differential manifolds. These are naturally expressed in the language of exterior calculus and differential forms . The fundamental theorems of integral calculus in several variables — namely Green's theorem , the divergence theorem , and Stokes' theorem — generalize to a theorem (also called Stokes' theorem ) relating the exterior derivative and integration over submanifolds . 
 [ edit ] Differential calculus of functions 
 Differentiable functions between two manifolds are needed in order to formulate suitable notions of submanifolds , and other related concepts. If f : M → N is a differentiable function from a differentiable manifold M of dimension m to another differentiable manifold N of dimension n , then the differential of f is a mapping df : T M → T N . At each point of M , this is a linear transformation from one tangent space to another: 
 
 
 
 The rank of f at p is the rank of this linear transformation. 
 Usually the rank of a function is a pointwise property. However, if the function has maximal rank, then the rank will remain constant in a neighborhood of a point. A differentiable function "usually" has maximal rank, in a precise sense given by Sard's theorem . Functions of maximal rank at a point are called immersions and submersions : 
 
 If m ≤ n , and f &#160;: M → N has rank m at p ∈ M , then f is called an immersion at p . If f is an immersion at all points of M and is a homeomorphism onto its image, then f is an embedding . Embeddings formalize the notion of M being a submanifold of N . In general, an embedding is an immersion without self-intersections and other sorts of non-local topological irregularities. 
 
 
 If m ≥ n , and f : M → N has rank n at p ∈ M , then f is called a submersion at p . The implicit function theorem states that if f is a submersion at p , then M is locally a product of N and R m − n near p . In formal terms, there exist coordinates ( y 1 , ..., y n ) in a neighborhood of f ( p ) in N , and m − n functions x 1 ,..., x m − n defined in a neighborhood of p in M such that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is a system of local coordinates of M in a neighborhood of p . Submersions form the foundation of the theory of fibrations and fibre bundles . 
 
 [ edit ] Lie derivative 
 A Lie derivative , named after Sophus Lie , is a derivation on the algebra of tensor fields over a manifold M . The vector space of all Lie derivatives on M forms an infinite dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket [ disambiguation needed ] defined by 
 
 
 
 The Lie derivatives are represented by vector fields , as infinitesimal generators of flows ( active diffeomorphisms ) on M . Looking at it the other way round, the group of diffeomorphisms of M has the associated Lie algebra structure, of Lie derivatives, in a way directly analogous to the Lie group theory. 
 [ edit ] Exterior calculus 
 For more details on this topic, see differential form . 
 The exterior calculus allows for a generalization of the gradient , divergence and curl operators. 
 The bundle of differential forms , at each point, consists of all totally antisymmetric multilinear maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into n -forms for each n at most equal to the dimension of the manifold; an n -form is an n -variable form, also called a form of degree n . The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an n -form is a tensor with cotangent rank n and tangent rank 0. But not every such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric. 
 [ edit ] Exterior derivative 
 There is a map from scalars to covectors called the exterior derivative 
 
 
 
 such that 
 
 
 
 This map is the one that relates covectors to infinitesimal displacements, mentioned above; some covectors are the exterior derivatives of scalar functions. It can be generalized into a map from the n -forms onto the ( n +1)-forms. Applying this derivative twice will produce a zero form. Forms with zero derivative are called closed forms, while forms that are themselves exterior derivatives are known as exact forms. 
 The space of differential forms at a point is the archetypal example of an exterior algebra ; thus it possesses a wedge product, mapping a k -form and l -form to a ( k + l )-form. The exterior derivative extends to this algebra, and satisfies a version of the product rule : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From the differential forms and the exterior derivative, one can define the de Rham cohomology of the manifold. The rank n cohomology group is the quotient group of the closed forms by the exact forms. 
 [ edit ] Topology of differentiable manifolds 
 [ edit ] Relationship with topological manifolds 
 Every topological manifold in dimension 1, 2, or 3 has a unique differential structure (up to diffeomorphism); thus the concepts of topological and differentiable manifold are distinct only in higher dimensions. It is known that in each higher dimension, there are some topological manifolds with no smooth structure, and some with multiple non-diffeomorphic structures. 
 The existence of non-smoothable manifolds was proven by Kervaire (1960 ), and later explained in the context of Donaldson's theorem (compare Hilbert's fifth problem ); [ 9 ] a good example of a non-smoothable manifold is the E 8 manifold . 
 The classic example of manifolds with multiple incompatible structures are the exotic 7-spheres of John Milnor . [ 10 ] 
 [ edit ] Classification 
 Every second-countable 1-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of countably many copies of R (the real line ) and S (the circle ); the only connected examples are R and S , and of these only S is compact. In higher dimensions, classification theory normally focuses only on compact connected manifolds. 
 For a classification of 2-manifolds, see surface : in particular compact connected oriented 2-manifolds are classified by their genus, which is a nonnegative integer. 
 A classification of 3-manifolds follows in principle from the geometrization of 3-manifolds and various recognition results for geometrizable 3-manifolds, such as Mostow rigidity and Sela's algorithm for the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups. [ 11 ] 
 The classification of n -manifolds for n greater than three is known to be impossible, even up to homotopy equivalence . Given any finitely presented group, one can construct a closed 4-manifold having that group as fundamental group. Since there is no algorithm to decide the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups, there is no algorithm to decide if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. Since the previously described construction results in a class of 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic if and only if their groups are isomorphic, the homeomorphism problem for 4-manifolds is undecidable . In addition, since even recognizing the trivial group is undecidable, it is not even possible in general to decide if a manifold has trivial fundamental group, i.e. is simply connected . 
 Simply connected 4-manifolds have been classified up to homeomorphism by Freedman using the intersection form and Kirby–Siebenmann invariant . Smooth 4-manifold theory is known to be much more complicated, as the exotic smooth structures on R 4 demonstrate. 
 However, the situation becomes more tractable for simply connected smooth manifolds of dimension ≥ 5, where the h-cobordism theorem can be used to reduce the classification to a classification up to homotopy equivalence, and surgery theory can be applied. [ 12 ] This has been carried out to provide an explicit classification of simply connected 5-manifolds by Dennis Barden. 
 [ edit ] Structures on manifolds 
 [ edit ] (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds 
 A Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold on which the tangent spaces are equipped with inner products in a differentiable fashion. The inner product structure is given in the form of a symmetric 2-tensor called the Riemannian metric . This metric can be used to interconvert vectors and covectors, and to define a rank 4 Riemann curvature tensor . On a Riemannian manifold one has notions of length, volume, and angle. Any differentiable manifold can be given a Riemannian structure. 
 A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a variant of Riemannian manifold where the metric tensor is allowed to have an indefinite signature (as opposed to a positive-definite one). Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (3, 1) are important in general relativity . Not every differentiable manifold can be given a pseudo-Riemannian structure; there are topological restrictions on doing so. 
 A Finsler manifold is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold, in which the inner product is replaced with a vector norm ; this allows the definition of length, but not angle. 
 [ edit ] Symplectic manifolds 
 For more details on this topic, see symplectic manifold . 
 A symplectic manifold is a manifold equipped with a closed , nondegenerate 2-form . This condition forces symplectic manifolds to be even-dimensional. Cotangent bundles, which arise as phase spaces in Hamiltonian mechanics , are the motivating example, but many compact manifolds also have symplectic structure. All orientable surfaces embedded in Euclidean space have a symplectic structure , the signed area form on each tangent space induced by the ambient Euclidean inner product . [ note 1 ] Every Riemann surface is an example of such a surface, and hence a symplectic manifold , when considered as a real manifold . 
 [ edit ] Lie groups 
 For more details on this topic, see Lie group . 
 A Lie group is C ∞ manifold that also carries a group structure whose product and inversion operations are smooth as maps of manifolds. These objects arise naturally in describing symmetries. 
 [ edit ] Generalizations 
 The category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps lacks certain desirable properties, and people have tried to generalize smooth manifolds in order to rectify this. Diffeological spaces use a different notion of chart known as a "plot". Frölicher spaces and orbifolds are other attempts. 
 A rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piece-wise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.

 [ edit ] Notes 
 
 
 ^  This form is clearly nondegenerate, and it must be closed because it is top-dimensional with respect to the surface ; this reflects the exceptional isomorphism of Lie groups Sp(2, R ) ≅ SL(2, R ) between the symplectic group (corresponding to symplectic structure) and the special linear group (corresponding to orientable structure). Note that a symplectic structure requires an additional integrability condition, beyond this isomorphism of groups: it is not just a G-structure .

 A nondifferentiable atlas of charts for the globe. The results of calculus may not be compatible between charts if the atlas is not differentiable. In the middle chart the Tropic of Cancer is a smooth curve, whereas in the first it has a sharp corner. The notion of a differentiable manifold refines that of a manifold by requiring the functions that transform between charts to be differentiable. 
 
 
 In mathematics, a differentiable manifold is a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a linear space to allow one to do calculus . Any manifold can be described by a collection of charts , also known as an atlas. One may then apply ideas from calculus while working within the individual charts, since each chart lies within a linear space to which the usual rules of calculus apply. If the charts are suitably compatible (namely, the transition from one chart to another is differentiable ), then computations done in one chart are valid in any other differentiable chart. 
 In formal terms, a differentiable manifold is a topological manifold with a globally defined differential structure . Any topological manifold can be given a differential structure locally by using the homeomorphisms in its atlas and the standard differential structure on a linear space. To induce a global differential structure on the local coordinate systems induced by the homeomorphisms, their composition on chart intersections in the atlas must be differentiable functions on the corresponding linear space. In other words, where the domains of charts overlap, the coordinates defined by each chart are required to be differentiable with respect to the coordinates defined by every chart in the atlas. The maps that relate the coordinates defined by the various charts to one another are called transition maps. 
 Differentiability means different things in different contexts including: continuously differentiable , k times differentiable, and holomorphic . Furthermore, the ability to induce such a differential structure on an abstract space allows one to extend the definition of differentiability to spaces without global coordinate systems. A differential structure allows one to define the globally differentiable tangent space , differentiable functions, and differentiable tensor and vector fields. Differentiable manifolds are very important in physics . Special kinds of differentiable manifolds form the basis for physical theories such as classical mechanics , general relativity , and Yang–Mills theory. It is possible to develop a calculus for differentiable manifolds. This leads to such mathematical machinery as the exterior calculus. The study of calculus on differentiable manifolds is known as differential geometry.

 [ edit ] History 
 Main article: History of manifolds and varieties 
 The emergence of differential geometry as a distinct discipline is generally credited to Carl Friedrich Gauss and Bernhard Riemann . Riemann first described manifolds in his famous habilitation lecture [ 1 ] before the faculty at Göttingen. He motivated the idea of a manifold by an intuitive process of varying a given object in a new direction, and presciently described the role of coordinate systems and charts in subsequent formal developments: 
 
 Having constructed the notion of a manifoldness of n dimensions, and found that its true character consists in the property that the determination of position in it may be reduced to n determinations of magnitude, ... – B. Riemann 
 
 The works of physicists such as James Clerk Maxwell [ citation needed ] , and mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita [ 2 ] led to the development of tensor analysis and the notion of covariance , which identifies an intrinsic geometric property as one that is invariant with respect to coordinate transformations . These ideas found a key application in Einstein 's theory of general relativity and its underlying equivalence principle . A modern definition of a 2-dimensional manifold was given by Hermann Weyl in his 1913 book on Riemann surfaces . [ 3 ] The widely accepted general definition of a manifold in terms of an atlas is due to Hassler Whitney . [ 4 ]

 A presentation of a topological manifold is a second countable Hausdorff space that is locally homeomorphic to a linear space, by a collection (called an atlas ) of homeomorphisms called charts . The composition of one chart with the inverse of another chart is a function called a transition map , and defines a homeomorphism of an open subset of the linear space onto another open subset of the linear space. This formalizes the notion of "patching together pieces of a space to make a manifold" – the manifold produced also contains the data of how it has been patched together. However, different atlases (patchings) may produce "the same" manifold; a manifold does not come with a preferred atlas. And, thus, one defines a topological manifold to be a space as above with an equivalence class of atlases, where one defines equivalence of atlases below. 
 There are a number of different types of differentiable manifolds, depending on the precise differentiability requirements on the transition functions. Some common examples include the following. 
 
 A differentiable manifold is a topological manifold equipped with an equivalence class of atlases whose transition maps are all differentiable. In broader terms, a C k -manifold is a topological manifold with an atlas whose transition maps are all k -times continuously differentiable. 
 
 
 A smooth manifold or C ∞ -manifold is a differentiable manifold for which all the transition maps are smooth . That is, derivatives of all orders exist; so it is a C k -manifold for all k . An equivalence class of such atlases is said to be a smooth structure . 
 
 
 An analytic manifold , or C ω -manifold is a smooth manifold with the additional condition that each transition map is analytic : the Taylor expansion is absolutely convergent and equals the function on some open ball. 
 
 
 A complex manifold is a topological space modeled on a Euclidean space over the complex field and for which all the transition maps are holomorphic . 
 
 While there is a meaningful notion of a C k atlas, there is no distinct notion of a C k manifold other than C 0 (continuous maps: a topological manifold) and C ∞ (smooth maps: a smooth manifold), because every C k -structure with k &gt; 0, there is a unique C k -equivalent C ∞ -structure (every C k -structure is uniquely smoothable ) – a result of Whitney (and further, two C k atlases that are equivalent to a single C ∞ atlas are equivalent as C k atlases, so two distinct C k atlases do not collide); see Differential structure: Existence and uniqueness theorems for details. Thus one uses the terms "differentiable manifold" and "smooth manifold" interchangeably. This is in stark contrast to C k maps, where there are meaningful differences for different k. For example, the Nash embedding theorem states that any manifold can be C k isometrically embedded in Euclidean space R N – for any 1 ≤ k ≤ ∞ there is a sufficiently large N , but N depends on k . 
 On the other hand, complex manifolds are significantly more restrictive. As an example, Chow's theorem states that any projective complex manifold is in fact a projective variety – it has an algebraic structure.

 Charts on a manifold 
 
 An atlas on a topological space X is a collection of pairs {( U α ,φ α )} called charts , where the U α are open sets that cover X , and for each index α 
 
 
 
 is a homeomorphism of U α onto an open subset of n -dimensional real space. The transition maps of the atlas are the functions 
 
 
 
 Every topological manifold has an atlas. A C k -atlas is an atlas whose transition maps are C k . A topological manifold has a C 0 -atlas and in general a C k -manifold has a C k -atlas. A continuous atlas is a C 0 atlas, a smooth atlas is a C ∞ atlas and an analytic atlas is a C ω atlas. If the atlas is at least C 1 , it is also called a differential structure or differentiable structure . A holomorphic atlas is an atlas whose underlying Euclidean space is defined on the complex field and whose transition maps are biholomorphic . 
 [ edit ] Compatible atlases 
 Different atlases can give rise to, in essence, the same manifold. The circle can be mapped by two coordinate charts, but if the domains of these charts are changed slightly a different atlas for the same manifold is obtained. These different atlases can be combined into a bigger atlas. It can happen that the transition maps of such a combined atlas are not as smooth as those of the constituent atlases. If C k atlases can be combined to form a C k atlas, then they are called compatible. Compatibility of atlases is an equivalence relation ; by combining all the atlases in an equivalence class , a maximal atlas can be constructed. Each C k atlas belongs to a unique maximal C k atlas. 
 [ edit ] Alternative definitions 
 [ edit ] Pseudogroups 
 The notion of a pseudogroup [ 5 ] provides a flexible generalization of atlases in order to allow a variety of different structures to be defined on manifolds in a uniform way. A pseudogroup consists of a topological space S and a collection Γ consisting of homeomorphisms from open subsets of S to other open subsets of S such that 
 
 If f ∈ Γ, and U is an open subset of the domain of f , then the restriction f | U is also in Γ. 
 If f is a homeomorphism from a union of open subsets of S , , to an open subset of S , then f ∈ Γ provided for every i . 
 For every open U ⊂ S , the identity transformation of U is in Γ. 
 If f ∈ Γ, then f −1 ∈ Γ. 
 The composition of two elements of Γ is in Γ. 
 
 These last three conditions are analogous to the definition of a group . Note that Γ need not be a group, however, since the functions are not globally defined on S . For example, the collection of all local C k diffeomorphisms on R n form a pseudogroup. All biholomorphisms between open sets in C n form a pseudogroup. More examples include: orientation preserving maps of R n , symplectomorphisms , Möbius transformations , affine transformations , and so on. Thus a wide variety of function classes determine pseudogroups. 
 An atlas ( U i , φ i ) of homeomorphisms φ i from U i ⊂ M to open subsets of a topological space S is said to be compatible with a pseudogroup Γ provided that the transition functions φ j o φ i −1 : φ i ( U i ∩ U j ) → φ j ( U i ∩ U j ) are all in Γ. 
 A differentiable manifold is then an atlas compatible with the pseudogroup of C k functions on R n . A complex manifold is an atlas compatible with the biholomorphic functions on open sets in C n . And so forth. Thus pseudogroups provide a single framework in which to describe many structures on manifolds of importance to differential geometry and topology. 
 [ edit ] Structure sheaf 
 Sometimes it can be useful to use an alternative approach to endow a manifold with a C k -structure. Here k = 1, 2, ..., ∞, or ω for real analytic manifolds. Instead of considering coordinate charts, it is possible to start with functions defined on the manifold itself. The structure sheaf of M , denoted C k , is a sort of functor that defines, for each open set U ⊂ M , an algebra C k ( U ) of continuous functions U → R . A structure sheaf C k is said to give M the structure of a C k manifold of dimension n provided that, for any p ∈ M , there exists a neighborhood U of p and n functions x 1 ,..., x n ∈ C k ( U ) such that the map f = ( x 1 , ..., x n ): U → R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n , and such that C k | U is the pullback of the sheaf of k -times continuously differentiable functions on R n . [ 6 ] 
 In particular, this latter condition means that any function h in C k ( V ), for V , can be written uniquely as h ( x ) = H ( x 1 ( x ),..., x n ( x )), where H is a k -times differentiable function on f ( V ) (an open set in R n ). Thus, the sheaf-theoretic viewpoint is that the functions on a differentiable manifold can be expressed in local coordinates as differentiable functions on R n , and a fortiori this is sufficient to characterize the differential structure on the manifold. 
 [ edit ] Sheaves of local rings 
 A similar, but more technical, approach to defining differentiable manifolds can be formulated using the notion of a ringed space . This approach is strongly influenced by the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry , but uses local rings of the germs of differentiable functions. It is especially popular in the context of complex manifolds. 
 We begin by describing the basic structure sheaf on R n . If U is an open set in R n , let 
 
 O ( U ) = C k ( U , R ) 
 
 consist of all real-valued k -times continuously differentiable functions on U . As U varies, this determines a sheaf of rings on R n . The stalk O p for p ∈ R n consists of germs of functions near p , and is an algebra over R . In particular, this is a local ring whose unique maximal ideal consists of those functions that vanish at p . The pair ( R n , O ) is an example of a locally ringed space : it is a topological space equipped with a sheaf whose stalks are each local rings. 
 A differentiable manifold (of class C k ) consists of a pair ( M , O M ) where M is a second countable Hausdorff space , and O M is a sheaf of local R -algebras defined on M , such that the locally ringed space ( M , O M ) is locally isomorphic to ( R n , O ). In this way, differentiable manifolds can be thought of as schemes modelled on R n . This means that, [ 7 ] for each point p ∈ M , there is a neighborhood U of p , and a pair of functions ( f , f # ) where 
 
 f : U → f ( U ) ⊂ R n is a homeomorphism onto an open set in R n . 
 f # : O | f ( U ) → f * ( O M | U ) is an isomorphism of sheaves. 
 The localization of f # is an isomorphism of local rings 
 
 
 
 
 f # p : O f ( p ) → O M , p . 
 
 
 
 There are a number of important motivations for studying differentiable manifolds within this abstract framework. First, there is no a priori reason that the model space needs to be R n . For example (in particular in algebraic geometry ), one could take this to be the space of complex numbers C n equipped with the sheaf of holomorphic functions (thus arriving at the spaces of complex analytic geometry ), or the sheaf of polynomials (thus arriving at the spaces of interest in complex algebraic geometry). In broad terms, this concept can be adapted for any suitable notion of a scheme (see topos theory ). Second, coordinates are no longer explicitly necessary to the construction. The analog of a coordinate system is the pair ( f , f # ), but these merely quantify the idea of local isomorphism rather than being central to the discussion (as in the case of charts and atlases). Third, the sheaf O M is not manifestly a sheaf of functions at all. Rather, it emerges as a sheaf of functions as a consequence of the construction (via the quotients of local rings by their maximal ideals). Hence it is a more primitive definition of the structure (see synthetic differential geometry ). 
 A final advantage of this approach is that it allows for natural direct descriptions of many of the fundamental objects of study to differential geometry and topology. 
 
 The cotangent space at a point is I p / I p 2 , where I p is the maximal ideal of the stalk O M , p . 
 In general, the entire cotangent bundle can be obtained by a related technique (see cotangent bundle for details). 
 Taylor series (and jets ) can be approached in a coordinate-independent manner using the I p -adic filtration on O M , p . 
 The tangent bundle (or more precisely its sheaf of sections) can be identified with the sheaf of morphisms of O M into the ring of dual numbers . 
 
 [ edit ] Differentiable functions 
 A real valued function f on an n -dimensional differentiable manifold M is called differentiable at a point p ∈ M if it is differentiable in any coordinate chart defined around p . In more precise terms, if ( U , φ) is a chart where U is an open set in M containing p and φ: U → R n is the map defining the chart, then f is differentiable if and only if 
 
 
 
 is differentiable at φ( p ). The definition of differentiability depends on the choice of chart at p ; in general there will be many available charts. However, it follows from the chain rule applied to the transition functions between one chart and another that if f is differentiable in any particular chart at p , then it is differentiable in all charts at p . Analogous considerations apply to defining C k functions, smooth functions, and analytic functions. 
 [ edit ] Differentiation of functions 
 There are various ways to define the derivative of a function on a differentiable manifold, the most fundamental of which is the directional derivative . The definition of the directional derivative is complicated by the fact that a manifold will lack a suitable affine structure with which to define vectors . The directional derivative therefore looks at curves in the manifold instead of vectors. 
 [ edit ] Directional differentiation 
 Given a real valued function f on an m dimensional differentiable manifold M , the directional derivative of f at a point p in M is defined as follows. Suppose that γ( t ) is a curve in M with γ(0) = p , which is differentiable in the sense that its composition with any chart is a differentiable curve in R m . Then the directional derivative of f at p along γ is 
 
 
 
 If γ 1 and γ 2 are two curves such that γ 1 (0) = γ 2 (0) = p , and in any coordinate chart φ, 
 
 
 
 then, by the chain rule, f has the same directional derivative at p along γ 1 as along γ 2 . This means that the directional derivative depends only on the tangent vector of the curve at p . Thus the more abstract definition of directional differentiation adapted to the case of differentiable manifolds ultimately captures the intuitive features of directional differentiation in an affine space. 
 [ edit ] Tangent vectors and the differential 
 A tangent vector at p ∈ M is an equivalence class of differentiable curves γ with γ(0) = p , modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact between the curves. Therefore, 
 
 
 
 in every coordinate chart φ . Therefore, the equivalence classes are curves through p with a prescribed velocity vector at p . The collection of all tangent vectors at p forms a vector space : the tangent space to M at p , denoted T p M . 
 If X is a tangent vector at p and f a differentiable function defined near p , then differentiating f along any curve in the equivalence class defining X gives a well-defined directional derivative along X : 
 
 
 
 Once again, the chain rule establishes that this is independent of the freedom in selecting γ from the equivalence class, since any curve with the same first order contact will yield the same directional derivative. 
 If the function f is fixed, then the mapping 
 
 
 
 is a linear functional on the tangent space. This linear functional is often denoted by df ( p ) and is called the differential of f at p : 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] Partitions of unity 
 One of the topological features of the sheaf of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold is that it admits partitions of unity . This distinguishes the differential structure on a manifold from stronger structures (such as analytic and holomorphic structures) that in general fail to have partitions of unity. 
 Suppose that M is a manifold of class C k , where 0 ≤ k ≤ ∞. Let { U α } be an open covering of M . Then a partition of unity subordinate to the cover { U α } is a collection of real-valued C k functions φ i on M satisfying the following conditions: 
 
 The supports of the φ i are compact and locally finite ; 
 The support of φ i is completely contained in U α for some α; 
 The φ i sum to one at each point of M : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 (Note that this last condition is actually a finite sum at each point because of the local finiteness of the supports of the φ i .) 
 Every open covering of a C k manifold M has a C k partition of unity. This allows for certain constructions from the topology of C k functions on R n to be carried over to the category of differentiable manifolds. In particular, it is possible to discuss integration by choosing a partition of unity subordinate to a particular coordinate atlas, and carrying out the integration in each chart of R n . Partitions of unity therefore allow for certain other kinds of function spaces to be considered: for instance L p spaces , Sobolev spaces , and other kinds of spaces that require integration. 
 [ edit ] Differentiability of mappings between manifolds 
 Suppose M and N are two differentiable manifolds with dimensions m and n , respectively, and f is a function from M to N . Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces we know what it means for f to be continuous. But what does " f is C k ( M , N )" mean for k &#160;≥&#160;1? We know what that means when f is a function between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose f with a chart of M and a chart of N such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to M to N to Euclidean space we know what it means for that map to be C k ( R m , R n ). We define " f is C k ( M , N )" to mean that all such compositions of f with charts are C k ( R m , R n ). Once again the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on M and N are selected. However, defining the derivative itself is more subtle. If M or N is itself already a Euclidean space, then we don't need a chart to map it to one. 
 [ edit ] Algebra of scalars 
 For a C k manifold M , the set of real-valued C k functions on the manifold forms an algebra under pointwise addition and multiplication, called the algebra of scalar fields or simply the algebra of scalars . This algebra has the constant function 1 as the multiplicative identity, and is a differentiable analog of the ring of regular functions in algebraic geometry. 
 It is possible to reconstruct a manifold from its algebra of scalars, first as a set, but also as a topological space – this is an application of the Banach–Stone theorem , and is more formally known as the spectrum of a C*-algebra . First, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the points of M and the algebra homomorphisms φ: C k ( M ) → R , as such a homomorphism φ corresponds a codimension one ideal in C k ( M ) (namely the kernel of φ ), which is necessarily a maximal ideal. On the converse, every maximal ideal in this algebra is an ideal of functions vanishing at a single point, which demonstrates that MSpec (the Max Spec) of C k ( M ) recovers M as a point set, though in fact it recovers M as a topological space. 
 One can define various geometric structures algebraically in terms of the algebra of scalars, and these definitions often generalize to algebraic geometry (interpreting rings geometrically) and operator theory (interpreting Banach spaces geometrically). For example, the tangent bundle to M can be defined as the derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on M . 
 This "algebraization" of a manifold (replacing a geometric object with an algebra) leads to the notion of a C*-algebra – a commutative C*-algebra being precisely the ring of scalars of a manifold, by Banach–Stone, and allows one to consider non commutative C*-algebras as non-commutative generalizations of manifolds. This is the basis of the field of noncommutative geometry .

 [ edit ] Bundles 
 [ edit ] Tangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tangent bundle . 
 The tangent space of a point consists of the possible directional derivatives at that point, and has the same dimension n as does the manifold. For a set of (non-singular) coordinates x k local to the point, the coordinate derivatives typically define a basis of the tangent space. The collection of tangent spaces at all points can in turn be made into a manifold, the tangent bundle , whose dimension is 2 n . The tangent bundle is where tangent vectors lie, and is itself a differentiable manifold. The Lagrangian is a function on the tangent bundle. One can also define the tangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets from R (the real line ) to M . 
 One may construct an atlas for the tangent bundle consisting of charts based on U α × R n , where U α denotes one of the charts in the atlas for M . Each of these new charts is the tangent bundle for the charts U α . The transition maps on this atlas are defined from the transition maps on the original manifold, and retain the original differentiability class. 
 [ edit ] Cotangent bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see cotangent bundle . 
 The dual space of a vector space is the set of real valued linear functions on the vector space. The cotangent space at a point is the dual of the tangent space at that point, and the cotangent bundle is the collection of all cotangent spaces. 
 Like the tangent bundle the cotangent bundle is again a differentiable manifold. The Hamiltonian is a scalar on the cotangent bundle. The total space of a cotangent bundle has the structure of a symplectic manifold . Cotangent vectors are sometimes called covectors . One can also define the cotangent bundle as the bundle of 1- jets of functions from M to R . 
 Elements of the cotangent space can be thought of as infinitesimal displacements: if f is a differentiable function we can define at each point p a cotangent vector df p , which sends a tangent vector X p to the derivative of f associated with X p . However, not every covector field can be expressed this way. Those that can are referred to as exact differentials . For a given set of local coordinates x k the differentials dx k 
p form a basis of the cotangent space at p . 
 [ edit ] Tensor bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see tensor bundle . 
 The tensor bundle is the direct sum of all tensor products of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle. Each element of the bundle is a tensor field , which can act as a multilinear operator on vector fields, or on other tensor fields. 
 The tensor bundle cannot be a differentiable manifold, since it is infinite dimensional. It is however an algebra over the ring of scalar functions. Each tensor is characterized by its ranks, which indicate how many tangent and cotangent factors it has. Sometimes these ranks are referred to as covariant and contravariant ranks, signifying tangent and cotangent ranks, respectively. 
 [ edit ] Frame bundle 
 For more details on this topic, see frame bundle . 
 A frame (or, in more precise terms, a tangent frame) is an ordered basis of particular tangent space. Likewise, a tangent frame is a linear isomorphism of R n to this tangent space. A moving tangent frame is an ordered list of vector fields that give a basis at every point of their domain. One may also regard a moving frame as a section of the frame bundle F( M ), a GL( n , R ) principal bundle made up of the set of all frames over M . The frame bundle is useful because tensor fields on M can be regarded as equivariant vector-valued functions on F( M ). 
 [ edit ] Jet bundles 
 For more details on this topic, see jet bundle . 
 On a manifold that is sufficiently smooth, various kinds of jet bundles can also be considered. The (first-order) tangent bundle of a manifold is the collection of curves in the manifold modulo the equivalence relation of first-order contact . By analogy, the k -th order tangent bundle is the collection of curves modulo the relation of k -th order contact. Likewise, the cotangent bundle is the bundle of 1-jets of functions on the manifold: the k -jet bundle is the bundle of their k -jets. These and other examples of the general idea of jet bundles play a significant role in the study of differential operators on manifolds. 
 The notion of a frame also generalizes to the case of higher-order jets. Define a k -th order frame to be the k -jet of a diffeomorphism from R n to M . [ 8 ] The collection of all k -th order frames, F k ( M ), is a principle G k bundle over M , where G k is the group of k -jets ; i.e., the group made up of k -jets of diffeomorphisms of R n that fix the origin. Note that GL( n , R ) is naturally isomorphic to G 1 , and a subgroup of every G k , k ≥ 2. In particular, a section of F 2 ( M ) gives the frame components of a connection on M . Thus, the quotient bundle F 2 ( M )/ GL( n , R ) is the bundle of linear connections over M . 
 [ edit ] Calculus on manifolds 
 Many of the techniques from multivariate calculus also apply, mutatis mutandis , to differentiable manifolds. One can define the directional derivative of a differentiable function along a tangent vector to the manifold, for instance, and this leads to a means of generalizing the total derivative of a function: the differential. From the perspective of calculus, the derivative of a function on a manifold behaves in much the same way as the ordinary derivative of a function defined on a Euclidean space, at least locally . For example, there are versions of the implicit and inverse function theorems for such functions. 
 There are, however, important differences in the calculus of vector fields (and tensor fields in general). In brief, the directional derivative of a vector field is not well-defined, or at least not defined in a straightforward manner. Several generalizations of the derivative of a vector field (or tensor field) do exist, and capture certain formal features of differentiation in Euclidean spaces. The chief among these are: 
 
 The Lie derivative , which is uniquely defined by the differential structure, but fails to satisfy some of the usual features of directional differentiation. 
 An affine connection , which is not uniquely defined, but generalizes in a more complete manner the features of ordinary directional differentiation. Because an affine connection is not unique, it is an additional piece of data that must be specified on the manifold. 
 
 Ideas from integral calculus also carry over to differential manifolds. These are naturally expressed in the language of exterior calculus and differential forms . The fundamental theorems of integral calculus in several variables — namely Green's theorem , the divergence theorem , and Stokes' theorem — generalize to a theorem (also called Stokes' theorem ) relating the exterior derivative and integration over submanifolds . 
 [ edit ] Differential calculus of functions 
 Differentiable functions between two manifolds are needed in order to formulate suitable notions of submanifolds , and other related concepts. If f : M → N is a differentiable function from a differentiable manifold M of dimension m to another differentiable manifold N of dimension n , then the differential of f is a mapping df : T M → T N . At each point of M , this is a linear transformation from one tangent space to another: 
 
 
 
 The rank of f at p is the rank of this linear transformation. 
 Usually the rank of a function is a pointwise property. However, if the function has maximal rank, then the rank will remain constant in a neighborhood of a point. A differentiable function "usually" has maximal rank, in a precise sense given by Sard's theorem . Functions of maximal rank at a point are called immersions and submersions : 
 
 If m ≤ n , and f &#160;: M → N has rank m at p ∈ M , then f is called an immersion at p . If f is an immersion at all points of M and is a homeomorphism onto its image, then f is an embedding . Embeddings formalize the notion of M being a submanifold of N . In general, an embedding is an immersion without self-intersections and other sorts of non-local topological irregularities. 
 
 
 If m ≥ n , and f : M → N has rank n at p ∈ M , then f is called a submersion at p . The implicit function theorem states that if f is a submersion at p , then M is locally a product of N and R m − n near p . In formal terms, there exist coordinates ( y 1 , ..., y n ) in a neighborhood of f ( p ) in N , and m − n functions x 1 ,..., x m − n defined in a neighborhood of p in M such that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is a system of local coordinates of M in a neighborhood of p . Submersions form the foundation of the theory of fibrations and fibre bundles . 
 
 [ edit ] Lie derivative 
 A Lie derivative , named after Sophus Lie , is a derivation on the algebra of tensor fields over a manifold M . The vector space of all Lie derivatives on M forms an infinite dimensional Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket [ disambiguation needed ] defined by 
 
 
 
 The Lie derivatives are represented by vector fields , as infinitesimal generators of flows ( active diffeomorphisms ) on M . Looking at it the other way round, the group of diffeomorphisms of M has the associated Lie algebra structure, of Lie derivatives, in a way directly analogous to the Lie group theory. 
 [ edit ] Exterior calculus 
 For more details on this topic, see differential form . 
 The exterior calculus allows for a generalization of the gradient , divergence and curl operators. 
 The bundle of differential forms , at each point, consists of all totally antisymmetric multilinear maps on the tangent space at that point. It is naturally divided into n -forms for each n at most equal to the dimension of the manifold; an n -form is an n -variable form, also called a form of degree n . The 1-forms are the cotangent vectors, while the 0-forms are just scalar functions. In general, an n -form is a tensor with cotangent rank n and tangent rank 0. But not every such tensor is a form, as a form must be antisymmetric. 
 [ edit ] Exterior derivative 
 There is a map from scalars to covectors called the exterior derivative 
 
 
 
 such that 
 
 
 
 This map is the one that relates covectors to infinitesimal displacements, mentioned above; some covectors are the exterior derivatives of scalar functions. It can be generalized into a map from the n -forms onto the ( n +1)-forms. Applying this derivative twice will produce a zero form. Forms with zero derivative are called closed forms, while forms that are themselves exterior derivatives are known as exact forms. 
 The space of differential forms at a point is the archetypal example of an exterior algebra ; thus it possesses a wedge product, mapping a k -form and l -form to a ( k + l )-form. The exterior derivative extends to this algebra, and satisfies a version of the product rule : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From the differential forms and the exterior derivative, one can define the de Rham cohomology of the manifold. The rank n cohomology group is the quotient group of the closed forms by the exact forms. 
 [ edit ] Topology of differentiable manifolds 
 [ edit ] Relationship with topological manifolds 
 Every topological manifold in dimension 1, 2, or 3 has a unique differential structure (up to diffeomorphism); thus the concepts of topological and differentiable manifold are distinct only in higher dimensions. It is known that in each higher dimension, there are some topological manifolds with no smooth structure, and some with multiple non-diffeomorphic structures. 
 The existence of non-smoothable manifolds was proven by Kervaire (1960 ), and later explained in the context of Donaldson's theorem (compare Hilbert's fifth problem ); [ 9 ] a good example of a non-smoothable manifold is the E 8 manifold . 
 The classic example of manifolds with multiple incompatible structures are the exotic 7-spheres of John Milnor . [ 10 ] 
 [ edit ] Classification 
 Every second-countable 1-manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to a disjoint union of countably many copies of R (the real line ) and S (the circle ); the only connected examples are R and S , and of these only S is compact. In higher dimensions, classification theory normally focuses only on compact connected manifolds. 
 For a classification of 2-manifolds, see surface : in particular compact connected oriented 2-manifolds are classified by their genus, which is a nonnegative integer. 
 A classification of 3-manifolds follows in principle from the geometrization of 3-manifolds and various recognition results for geometrizable 3-manifolds, such as Mostow rigidity and Sela's algorithm for the isomorphism problem for hyperbolic groups. [ 11 ] 
 The classification of n -manifolds for n greater than three is known to be impossible, even up to homotopy equivalence . Given any finitely presented group, one can construct a closed 4-manifold having that group as fundamental group. Since there is no algorithm to decide the isomorphism problem for finitely presented groups, there is no algorithm to decide if two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. Since the previously described construction results in a class of 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic if and only if their groups are isomorphic, the homeomorphism problem for 4-manifolds is undecidable . In addition, since even recognizing the trivial group is undecidable, it is not even possible in general to decide if a manifold has trivial fundamental group, i.e. is simply connected . 
 Simply connected 4-manifolds have been classified up to homeomorphism by Freedman using the intersection form and Kirby–Siebenmann invariant . Smooth 4-manifold theory is known to be much more complicated, as the exotic smooth structures on R 4 demonstrate. 
 However, the situation becomes more tractable for simply connected smooth manifolds of dimension ≥ 5, where the h-cobordism theorem can be used to reduce the classification to a classification up to homotopy equivalence, and surgery theory can be applied. [ 12 ] This has been carried out to provide an explicit classification of simply connected 5-manifolds by Dennis Barden. 
 [ edit ] Structures on manifolds 
 [ edit ] (Pseudo-)Riemannian manifolds 
 A Riemannian manifold is a differentiable manifold on which the tangent spaces are equipped with inner products in a differentiable fashion. The inner product structure is given in the form of a symmetric 2-tensor called the Riemannian metric . This metric can be used to interconvert vectors and covectors, and to define a rank 4 Riemann curvature tensor . On a Riemannian manifold one has notions of length, volume, and angle. Any differentiable manifold can be given a Riemannian structure. 
 A pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a variant of Riemannian manifold where the metric tensor is allowed to have an indefinite signature (as opposed to a positive-definite one). Pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (3, 1) are important in general relativity . Not every differentiable manifold can be given a pseudo-Riemannian structure; there are topological restrictions on doing so. 
 A Finsler manifold is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold, in which the inner product is replaced with a vector norm ; this allows the definition of length, but not angle. 
 [ edit ] Symplectic manifolds 
 For more details on this topic, see symplectic manifold . 
 A symplectic manifold is a manifold equipped with a closed , nondegenerate 2-form . This condition forces symplectic manifolds to be even-dimensional. Cotangent bundles, which arise as phase spaces in Hamiltonian mechanics , are the motivating example, but many compact manifolds also have symplectic structure. All orientable surfaces embedded in Euclidean space have a symplectic structure , the signed area form on each tangent space induced by the ambient Euclidean inner product . [ note 1 ] Every Riemann surface is an example of such a surface, and hence a symplectic manifold , when considered as a real manifold . 
 [ edit ] Lie groups 
 For more details on this topic, see Lie group . 
 A Lie group is C ∞ manifold that also carries a group structure whose product and inversion operations are smooth as maps of manifolds. These objects arise naturally in describing symmetries. 
 [ edit ] Generalizations 
 The category of smooth manifolds with smooth maps lacks certain desirable properties, and people have tried to generalize smooth manifolds in order to rectify this. Diffeological spaces use a different notion of chart known as a "plot". Frölicher spaces and orbifolds are other attempts. 
 A rectifiable set generalizes the idea of a piece-wise smooth or rectifiable curve to higher dimensions; however, rectifiable sets are not in general manifolds.

 [ edit ] Notes 
 
 
 ^  This form is clearly nondegenerate, and it must be closed because it is top-dimensional with respect to the surface ; this reflects the exceptional isomorphism of Lie groups Sp(2, R ) ≅ SL(2, R ) between the symplectic group (corresponding to symplectic structure) and the special linear group (corresponding to orientable structure). Note that a symplectic structure requires an additional integrability condition, beyond this isomorphism of groups: it is not just a G-structure .

																 In topology , a branch of mathematics , a topological manifold is a topological space (can even be a separated space ) which looks locally like real n - dimensional space in a sense defined below. Topological manifolds form an important class of topological spaces with applications throughout mathematics. 
 A manifold can mean a topological manifold, or more frequently, a topological manifold together with some additional structure. Differentiable manifolds , for example, are topological manifolds equipped with a differential structure . Every manifold has an underlying topological manifold, obtained simply by forgetting the additional structure. An overview of the manifold concept is given in that article. This article focuses purely on the topological aspects of manifolds.

 [ edit ] Formal definition 
 A topological space X is called locally Euclidean if there is a non-negative integer n such that every point in X has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space &#160; E n (or, equivalently, to the real n -space &#160; R n , or to some connected open subset of either of two). [ 1 ] 
 A topological manifold is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space . It is common to place additional requirements on topological manifolds. In particular, many authors define them to be paracompact or second-countable . The reasons, and some equivalent conditions, are discussed below. 
 In the remainder of this article a manifold will mean a topological manifold. An n-manifold will mean a topological manifold such that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R n . 
 [ edit ] Examples 
 
 The real coordinate space R n is the prototypical n -manifold. 
 Any discrete space is a 0-dimensional manifold. 
 A circle is a compact 1-manifold. 
 A torus and a Klein bottle are compact 2-manifolds (or surfaces ). 
 The n -dimensional sphere S n is a compact n -manifold. 
 The n -dimensional torus T n (the product of n &#160;circles) is a compact n -manifold. 
 Projective spaces over the reals , complexes , or quaternions are compact manifolds.
 
 Real projective space RP n is a n -dimensional manifold. 
 Complex projective space CP n is a 2 n -dimensional manifold. 
 Quaternionic projective space HP n is a 4 n -dimensional manifold. 
 
 
 Manifolds related to projective space include Grassmannians , flag manifolds , and Stiefel manifolds . 
 Lens spaces are a class of manifolds that are quotients of odd-dimensional spheres. 
 Lie groups are manifolds endowed with a group structure. 
 Any open subset of an n -manifold is a n -manifold with the subspace topology . 
 If M is an m -manifold and N is an n -manifold, the product M  ×  N is a ( m + n )-manifold. 
 The disjoint union of a family of n -manifolds is a n -manifold (the pieces must all have the same dimension). 
 The connected sum of two n -manifolds results in another n -manifold.

 [ edit ] Properties 
 The property of being locally Euclidean is preserved by local homeomorphisms . That is, if X is locally Euclidean of dimension n and f &#160;: Y → X is a local homeomorphism, then Y is locally Euclidean of dimension n . In particular, being locally Euclidean is a topological property . 
 Manifolds inherit many of the local properties of Euclidean space. In particular, they are locally compact , locally connected , first countable , locally contractible , and locally metrizable . Being locally compact Hausdorff spaces, manifolds are necessarily Tychonoff spaces . 
 Adding the Hausdorff condition can make several properties become equivalent for a manifold. As an example, we can show that for a Hausdorff manifold, the notions of σ-compactness and second-countability are the same. Indeed, a Hausdorff manifold is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence it is (completely) regular [1] . Assume such a space X is σ-compact. Then it is Lindelöf, and because Lindelöf + regular implies paracompact, X is metrizable. But in a metrizable space, second-countability coincides with being Lindelöf, so X is second-countable. Conversely, if X is a Hausdorff second-countable manifold, it must be σ-compact [2] . 
 A manifold need not be connected, but every manifold M is a disjoint union of connected manifolds. These are just the connected components of M , which are open sets since manifolds are locally-connected. Being locally path connected, a manifold is path-connected if and only if it is connected. It follows that the path-components are the same as the components. 
 [ edit ] The Hausdorff axiom 
 The Hausdorff property is not a local one; so even though Euclidean space is Hausdorff, a locally Euclidean space need not be. It is true, however, that every locally Euclidean space is T 1 . 
 An example of a non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space is the line with two origins . This space is created by replacing the origin of the real line with two points, an open neighborhood of either of which includes all nonzero numbers in some open interval centered at zero. This space is not Hausdorff because the two origins cannot be separated. 
 [ edit ] Compactness and countability axioms 
 A manifold is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact . Since metrizability is such a desirable property for a topological space, it is common to add paracompactness to the definition of a manifold. In any case, non-paracompact manifolds are generally regarded as pathological . An example of a non-paracompact manifold is given by the long line . Paracompact manifolds have all the topological properties of metric spaces. In particular, they are perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces . 
 Manifolds are also commonly required to be second-countable . This is precisely the condition required to ensure that the manifold embeds in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. For any manifold the properties of being second-countable, Lindelöf , and σ-compact are all equivalent. 
 Every second-countable manifold is paracompact, but not vice-versa. However, the converse is nearly true: a paracompact manifold is second-countable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components . In particular, a connected manifold is paracompact if and only if it is second-countable. Every second-countable manifold is separable and paracompact. Moreover, if a manifold is separable and paracompact then it is also second-countable. 
 Every compact manifold is second-countable and paracompact. 
 [ edit ] Dimensionality 
 By invariance of domain , a non-empty n -manifold cannot be an m -manifold for n ≠ m . The dimension of a non-empty n -manifold is n . Being an n -manifold is a topological property , meaning that any topological space homeomorphic to an n -manifold is also an n -manifold. 
 A 1-dimensional manifold is often called a curve while a 2-dimensional manifold is called a surface . Higher dimensional manifolds are usually just called n -manifolds. For n = 3, 4, or 5 see 3-manifold , 4-manifold , and 5-manifold . 
 [ edit ] Coordinate charts 
 By definition, every point of a locally Euclidean space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of R n . Such neighborhoods are called Euclidean neighborhoods . It follows from invariance of domain that Euclidean neighborhoods are always open sets. One can always find Euclidean neighborhoods that are homeomorphic to "nice" open sets in R n . Indeed, a space M is locally Euclidean if and only if either of the following equivalent conditions holds: 
 
 every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R n . 
 every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R n itself. 
 
 A Euclidean neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R n is called a Euclidean ball . Euclidean balls form a basis for the topology of a locally Euclidean space. 
 For any Euclidean neighborhood U a homeomorphism φ&#160;: U → φ( U ) ⊂ R n is called a coordinate chart on U (although the word chart is frequently used to refer to the domain or range of such a map). A space M is locally Euclidean if and only if it can be covered by Euclidean neighborhoods. A set of Euclidean neighborhoods that cover M , together with their coordinate charts, is called an atlas on M . (The terminology comes from an analogy with cartography whereby a spherical globe can be described by an atlas of flat maps or charts). 
 Given two charts φ and ψ with overlapping domains U and V there is a transition function 
 
 ψφ −1 &#160;: φ( U  ∩  V ) → ψ( U  ∩  V ). 
 
 Such a map is a homeomorphism between open subsets of R n . That is, coordinate charts agree on overlaps up to homeomorphism. Different types of manifolds can be defined by placing restrictions on types of transition maps allowed. For example, for differentiable manifolds the transition maps are required to be diffeomorphisms . 
 [ edit ] Classification of manifolds 
 A 0-manifold is just a discrete space . Such spaces are classified by their cardinality . Every discrete space is paracompact. A discrete space is second-countable if and only if it is countable .

 [ edit ] Formal definition 
 A topological space X is called locally Euclidean if there is a non-negative integer n such that every point in X has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space &#160; E n (or, equivalently, to the real n -space &#160; R n , or to some connected open subset of either of two). [ 1 ] 
 A topological manifold is a locally Euclidean Hausdorff space . It is common to place additional requirements on topological manifolds. In particular, many authors define them to be paracompact or second-countable . The reasons, and some equivalent conditions, are discussed below. 
 In the remainder of this article a manifold will mean a topological manifold. An n-manifold will mean a topological manifold such that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R n .

 [ edit ] Properties 
 The property of being locally Euclidean is preserved by local homeomorphisms . That is, if X is locally Euclidean of dimension n and f &#160;: Y → X is a local homeomorphism, then Y is locally Euclidean of dimension n . In particular, being locally Euclidean is a topological property . 
 Manifolds inherit many of the local properties of Euclidean space. In particular, they are locally compact , locally connected , first countable , locally contractible , and locally metrizable . Being locally compact Hausdorff spaces, manifolds are necessarily Tychonoff spaces . 
 Adding the Hausdorff condition can make several properties become equivalent for a manifold. As an example, we can show that for a Hausdorff manifold, the notions of σ-compactness and second-countability are the same. Indeed, a Hausdorff manifold is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence it is (completely) regular [1] . Assume such a space X is σ-compact. Then it is Lindelöf, and because Lindelöf + regular implies paracompact, X is metrizable. But in a metrizable space, second-countability coincides with being Lindelöf, so X is second-countable. Conversely, if X is a Hausdorff second-countable manifold, it must be σ-compact [2] . 
 A manifold need not be connected, but every manifold M is a disjoint union of connected manifolds. These are just the connected components of M , which are open sets since manifolds are locally-connected. Being locally path connected, a manifold is path-connected if and only if it is connected. It follows that the path-components are the same as the components. 
 [ edit ] The Hausdorff axiom 
 The Hausdorff property is not a local one; so even though Euclidean space is Hausdorff, a locally Euclidean space need not be. It is true, however, that every locally Euclidean space is T 1 . 
 An example of a non-Hausdorff locally Euclidean space is the line with two origins . This space is created by replacing the origin of the real line with two points, an open neighborhood of either of which includes all nonzero numbers in some open interval centered at zero. This space is not Hausdorff because the two origins cannot be separated. 
 [ edit ] Compactness and countability axioms 
 A manifold is metrizable if and only if it is paracompact . Since metrizability is such a desirable property for a topological space, it is common to add paracompactness to the definition of a manifold. In any case, non-paracompact manifolds are generally regarded as pathological . An example of a non-paracompact manifold is given by the long line . Paracompact manifolds have all the topological properties of metric spaces. In particular, they are perfectly normal Hausdorff spaces . 
 Manifolds are also commonly required to be second-countable . This is precisely the condition required to ensure that the manifold embeds in some finite-dimensional Euclidean space. For any manifold the properties of being second-countable, Lindelöf , and σ-compact are all equivalent. 
 Every second-countable manifold is paracompact, but not vice-versa. However, the converse is nearly true: a paracompact manifold is second-countable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components . In particular, a connected manifold is paracompact if and only if it is second-countable. Every second-countable manifold is separable and paracompact. Moreover, if a manifold is separable and paracompact then it is also second-countable. 
 Every compact manifold is second-countable and paracompact. 
 [ edit ] Dimensionality 
 By invariance of domain , a non-empty n -manifold cannot be an m -manifold for n ≠ m . The dimension of a non-empty n -manifold is n . Being an n -manifold is a topological property , meaning that any topological space homeomorphic to an n -manifold is also an n -manifold. 
 A 1-dimensional manifold is often called a curve while a 2-dimensional manifold is called a surface . Higher dimensional manifolds are usually just called n -manifolds. For n = 3, 4, or 5 see 3-manifold , 4-manifold , and 5-manifold . 
 [ edit ] Coordinate charts 
 By definition, every point of a locally Euclidean space has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of R n . Such neighborhoods are called Euclidean neighborhoods . It follows from invariance of domain that Euclidean neighborhoods are always open sets. One can always find Euclidean neighborhoods that are homeomorphic to "nice" open sets in R n . Indeed, a space M is locally Euclidean if and only if either of the following equivalent conditions holds: 
 
 every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R n . 
 every point of M has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R n itself. 
 
 A Euclidean neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball in R n is called a Euclidean ball . Euclidean balls form a basis for the topology of a locally Euclidean space. 
 For any Euclidean neighborhood U a homeomorphism φ&#160;: U → φ( U ) ⊂ R n is called a coordinate chart on U (although the word chart is frequently used to refer to the domain or range of such a map). A space M is locally Euclidean if and only if it can be covered by Euclidean neighborhoods. A set of Euclidean neighborhoods that cover M , together with their coordinate charts, is called an atlas on M . (The terminology comes from an analogy with cartography whereby a spherical globe can be described by an atlas of flat maps or charts). 
 Given two charts φ and ψ with overlapping domains U and V there is a transition function 
 
 ψφ −1 &#160;: φ( U  ∩  V ) → ψ( U  ∩  V ). 
 
 Such a map is a homeomorphism between open subsets of R n . That is, coordinate charts agree on overlaps up to homeomorphism. Different types of manifolds can be defined by placing restrictions on types of transition maps allowed. For example, for differentiable manifolds the transition maps are required to be diffeomorphisms . 
 [ edit ] Classification of manifolds 
 A 0-manifold is just a discrete space . Such spaces are classified by their cardinality . Every discrete space is paracompact. A discrete space is second-countable if and only if it is countable . 
 Every nonempty, paracompact, connected 1-manifold is homeomorphic either to R or the circle . The unconnected ones are just disjoint unions of these. 
 Every nonempty, compact, connected 2-manifold (or surface ) is homeomorphic to the sphere , a connected sum of tori , or a connected sum of projective planes . See the classification theorem for surfaces for more details. 
 A classification of 3-manifolds results from Thurston's geometrization conjecture [ clarification needed ] whose proof was sketched by Grigori Perelman . The details have been provided by other members of the mathematical community. 
 The full classification of n -manifolds for n greater than three is known to be impossible; it is at least as hard as the word problem in group theory , which is known to be algorithmically undecidable . In fact, there is no algorithm for deciding whether a given manifold is simply connected . There is, however, a classification of simply connected manifolds of dimension ≥ 5.

 Manifold 
 
 
A manifold is a topological space that is locally Euclidean (i.e.,
 around every point, there is a neighborhood that
 is topologically the same as the open unit
 ball in ). To illustrate this idea, consider
 the ancient belief that the Earth was flat as contrasted with the modern evidence
 that it is round. The discrepancy arises essentially from the fact that on the small
 scales that we see, the Earth does indeed look flat. In general, any object that
 is nearly &quot;flat&quot; on small scales is a manifold, and so manifolds constitute
 a generalization of objects we could live on in which we would encounter the round/flat
 Earth problem, as first codified by Poincar&eacute;.
 
 
More concisely, any object that can be &quot;charted&quot; is a manifold.
 
 
 
One of the goals of topology is to find ways of distinguishing manifolds. For instance, a circle is topologically the same as any closed loop, no matter how different these
 two manifolds may appear. Similarly, the surface of a coffee mug with a handle is
 topologically the same as the surface of the donut, and this type of surface is called
 a (one-handled) torus .
 
 
As a topological space , a manifold can be compact or noncompact, and connected 
 or disconnected. Commonly, the unqualified term &quot;manifold&quot;is used to mean
 &quot; manifold with boundary .&quot; This
 is the usage followed in this work. However, an author will sometimes be more precise
 and use the term open manifold for a noncompact
 manifold without boundary or closed manifold for
 a compact manifold with boundary.
 
 
If a manifold contains its own boundary, it is called, not surprisingly, a &quot; manifold with boundary .&quot; The closed unit
 ball in is a manifold with boundary, and its boundary
 is the unit sphere. The concept can be generalized to manifolds with corners. By
 definition, every point on a manifold has a neighborhood together with a homeomorphism 
 of that neighborhood with an open ball in . In addition,
 a manifold must have a second countable topology .
 Unless otherwise indicated, a manifold is assumed to have finite dimension , for a positive integer.
 
 
 Smooth manifolds (also called differentiable manifolds) are manifolds for which overlapping charts &quot;relate smoothly&quot; to each other,
 meaning that the inverse of one followed by the other is an infinitely differentiable
 map from Euclidean space to itself. Manifolds
 arise naturally in a variety of mathematical and physical applications as &quot;global
 objects.&quot; For example, in order to precisely describe all the configurations
 of a robot arm or all the possible positions and momenta of a rocket, an object is
 needed to store all of these parameters. The objects that crop up are manifolds.
 From the geometric perspective, manifolds represent the profound idea having to do
 with global versus local properties.
 
 
The basic example of a manifold is Euclidean space , and many of its properties carry over to manifolds. In addition, any smooth boundary
 of a subset of Euclidean space, like the circle or the sphere, is a manifold. Manifolds
 are therefore of interest in the study of geometry ,
 topology , and analysis .
 
 
A submanifold is a subset of a manifold that is itself a manifold, but has smaller dimension. For example, the equator of a sphere is a
 submanifold. Many common examples of manifolds are submanifolds of Euclidean space.
 In fact, Whitney showed in the 1930s that any manifold can be embedded 
 in , where .
 
 
A manifold may be endowed with more structure than a locally Euclidean topology. For example, it could be smooth , complex ,
 or even algebraic (in order of specificity).
 A smooth manifold with a metric is called a
 Riemannian manifold , and one with a symplectic
 structure is called a symplectic manifold .
 Finally, a complex manifold with a K&auml;hler
 structure is called a K&auml;hler manifold .

 1 Zero dimensional manifolds 
 
 
 For zero dimensional manifolds an orientation is a map from the manifold to , i.e. an orientation is a map . From now on we assume that all manifolds have positive dimension. Unless otherwise stated the manifolds have empty boundary.
 
 2 Orientation of topological manifolds 
 
 
 An orientation of a topological manifold is a choice of a maximal atlas, such that the coordinate changes are orientation preserving. To make this precise we have to define when a homeomorphism from an open subset  of  to another open subset  is orientation preserving. We do this in terms of singular homology groups.
 
 
 Definition 2.1 . A homeomorphism  from an open subset  of  to another open subset  is orientation preserving, if for each  the map  is the identity map. Here the isomorphisms  is the following: We first take the map to  (or to ) induced by the translation mapping  to  resp.  and then the inverse of the excision isomorphism. The isomorphism  is the inverse of the corresponding map.
 
 
 
 Definition 2.2 . An orientation of an -dimensional topological manifold  is the choice of a maximal oriented atlas . Here an atlas  is called oriented if all coordinate changes  are orientation preserving. 
 Note that any oriented atlas defines a maximal oriented atlas by adding all charts such that the atlas is still oriented. This is normally the way an oriented atlas is given. 
 A topological manifold  is called orientable if it has a topological orientation, otherwise it is called non-orientable . 
 A topological manifold  together with a topological orientation is called an oriented topological manifold .
 
 
 An open subset of an oriented topological manifold is oriented by restring the charts in the maximal oriented atlas to the intersection with the open subset. A homeomorphism  between oriented topological manifolds is orientation preserving if for each chart  in the oriented atlas of  the chart  is in the oriented atlas of . 
 There are several equivalent formulations of orientations both for topological manifolds and for smooth manifolds which we will explain in the following sections.
 
 3 Reformulation in terms of local homological orientations 
 
 
 An orientation of an -dimensional topological manifold  can also be defined in terms of the local homology groups  for each  in .
 
 
 Definition 3.1 . A local homological orientation of an -dimensional topological manifold  is the choice of a generator  of the local homology group  for each . Such a choice is called continuous , if for each  there is an open neighborhood  and a class  such that the map induced by the inclusion  maps  to  for each . A homological orientation of  is a continuous choice of local homological orientations. 
 
 
 As above an open subset  of  has an induced homological orientation which is given by the image under the inverse of the isomorphism induced by the inclusion . 
 To get an example consider a finite dimensional oriented real vector space  , i.e.  is equipped with an equivalence class of bases , where two bases are called equivalent, if and only if the matrix of the base change matrix has positive determinant. The orientation of  as a vector space gives a homological orientation of  as a topological space as follows. We first orient at  in  by considering the simplex spanned by . This contains  in its interior and is a generator of . By translations we define local orientations at arbitrary points of  mapping the local orientation at  to the local orientation at  by the map induced by the translation mapping  to . By construction this is a continuous family of local homological orientations and so gives a homological orientation of . From this we obtain homological orientations of all open subsets of . 
 The equivalence of these two concepts of an orientation of a topological manifold is shown as follows. A homeomorphism between manifolds equipped with a continuous family of local orientations is called orientation preserving if the induced map maps the corresponding local orientations to each other. We note that if both manifolds are open subsets of , this definition of orientation preserving homeomorphisms agrees with the one defined above. With this one defines for a topological manifold with a continuous family of local orientations a maximal oriented atlas by all charts which are orientation preserving, where we orient  as above. In turn if one has a maximal oriented atlas one uses it to transport the local orientations of open subsets of  to local homological orientations of , which are a continuous family, since the atlas is oriented.
 
 4 Orientation of smooth manifolds 
 
 
 The definition of an orientation for a topological manifold needs homology groups. For smooth manifolds the definition can be simplified. To distinguish the very similar definition we call it a smooth orientation.
 
 
 Definition 4.1 . A smooth orientation of an -dimensional smooth manifold  is the choice of a maximal oriented atlas . Here a smooth atlas  is called oriented if the determinant of the derivatives of all coordinate changes  is positive. The oriented atlas is called maximal if it cannot be enlarged to an oriented atlas by adding another chart. Note that any oriented atlas defines a maximal oriented atlas by adding all charts such that the atlas is still oriented. This is normally the way an oriented atlas is given. 
 A smooth manifold  is called orientable if it has a smooth orientation, otherwise it is called non-orientable . 
 A smooth manifold  together with a smooth orientation is called an oriented smooth manifold .
 
 
 5 From tangential orientations to homological orientations 
 
 
 For smooth manifolds we have now two definitions of an orientation, the smooth orientation and the orientation as a topological manifold. Here we explain why they are again equivalent concepts. The key observation is the following. If we have an orientation of the vector space  we have defined corresponding local orientations. If we change the orientation of the vector space , the local homological orientation changes its sign. Since there are two orientations of  as a vector space and two generators of  this correspondence is a bijection. 
 The next observation is that if we have a diffeomorphism from an open subset  in  to another open subset  in , then its differential preserves the standard orientation of  if and only if it preserves the corresponding local homological orientations and so the underlying homeomorphism is orientation preserving in the sense defined in the beginning of the last section. 
 Thus, if  is smoothly oriented, i.e. is equipped with a maximal oriented smooth atlas, then - forgetting the smooth structure - we obtain an oriented topological atlas and we define the corresponding topological orientation by passing to the maximal oriented topological atlas containing these charts. In turn, if one has a maximal oriented topological atlas the subset of smooth charts in it defines a smooth orientation.
 
 6 Reformulations of orientation for smooth manifolds 
 
 
 There are several equivalent formulations for orientations of smooth manifolds.
 
 
 Definition 6.1 . A tangential orientation of  is a continuous choice of an orientation of the tangent space  in the sense of orientations of vector spaces for every point . Here continuous means that for every M there is a chart  around , such that the differential of  maps for all  the orientation at  to the same orientation of .
 
 
 The relation between these two definitions is the following. If  is an oriented atlas, we define an orientation of  by choosing an oriented chart  around  and define the tangential orientation as the image of the orientation of  under the differential of . In turn, if a continuous orientation of  for all  is given, one defines a maximal oriented atlas as the atlas consisting of all charts  such that all differentials are orientation preserving, where we equip  with the induced orientation from  equipped with the standard orientation given by the canonical basis. It is easy to check that these constructions are well defined and give equivalent formulations. 
 Further equivalent formulations , which need a bit more knowledge of vector bundles are: 
 - An orientation of a smooth n-dimensional manifold  is given by the reduction of the structure group  of the tangent bundle  to , the subgroup of matrices with determinant . That this is an equivalence is an easy exercise. 
 - An orientation of a smooth manifold is given by a trivialization (an isomorphism to the trivial bundle) of the exterior bundle . That this is an equivalence is an easy exercise.
 
 
 Remark 6.2 . Since the different concepts of orientations are all equivalent, one normally speaks of an oriented manifold in all cases. We only used the adjectives to make clear that a priory the definitions are different.
 
 
 7 Criteria for orientability 
 
 
 There are various criteria for orientability: 
 
 
 Theorem 7.1 . A smooth -dimensional manifold is orientable if and only if the tangent bundle (or the normal bundle of an embedding into ) has a Thom class , i.e. a class , whose restriction to each fibre  is a generator of . Moreover the choice of a Thom class determines an orientation and vice versa.
 
 
 
 Proof. The class  orients each fibre  and hence defines an orientation of  as in Definition 2.2 . The converse if proven in, for example, &#91; Milnor&Stasheff1974 , Theorem 10.4&#93; and &#91; Bredon1993 , Theorem 11.3&#93;.  
 
 
 Theorem 7.2 . A smooth manifold  is orientable if and only if the first Stiefel Whitney class of its tangent bundle vanishes.
See &#91; Milnor&Stasheff1974 , Lemma 11.6 and Problem 12-A&#93; and &#91; Bredon1993 , Proposition 17.2&#93;.
 
 
 
 Theorem 7.3 &#91; Dold1995 , VIII Corollary 3.4&#93; . A connected closed -dimensional manifolds  is
orientable if and only if  is non-zero, in which case it
is isomorphic to . The choice of a generator is called a fundamental class  . The choice of
a generator corresponds to the choice of an orientation &#91; Dold1995 , VIII Definition 4.1&#93;. For
a not necessarily connected compact oriented manifold  the components
are oriented and the sum of the fundamental classes of the components
define the fundamental class of .
 
 
 There is a generalization of Theorem 7.3 to non-compact manifolds. 
 
 
 Theorem 7.4 &#91; Greenberg&Harper1981 , Corollary 22.26&#93; . If  is arbitrary, then  is orientable if and only if for each
compact connected subset  there is a class , such that for each  the map induced by the inclusion
maps  to a generator of  and the classes
mapped to each other under the maps induced by the inclusion
 for all .
The images of the classes  in  define a
homological orientation of  and in turn a homological orientation
determines the classes .
 
 
 8 Manifolds with boundary 
 
 
 For manifolds  with boundary an orientation is defined as an orientation of its interior. An orientation of  induces an orientation on the boundary . If  is -dimensional, we orient the boundary, which is -dimensional by attaching to  the local orientation , if the restriction of a chart around  from  to  to the interior is in the oriented atlas of the interior of . Otherwise we define . For example it we orient the interval  by the atlas of the interior given by the identity map, then  and and . 
 If the dimension of  is positive, we define the induced orientation both for smooth or topological manifolds in terms of an induced maximal oriented atlas of the boundary. If  is a (smooth) chart around a boundary point , such that its restriction to the inner is in the oriented atlas of the inner of , then the restriction of this chart to  is a chart of  and these charts form a maximal oriented (smooth) atlas of . The orientation given by this atlas is called the induced orientation on  . 
 The convention, that we consider the negative orientation on the boundary is for smooth manifolds equivalent to choosing an identification of the restriction of the tangent bundle of  to  with , where we identify  with a subbundle by selecting the outward normal vector field . With other words for smooth manifolds the induced orientation is characterized as the orientation of , such that any outward pointing normal vector plus this orientation is the given orientation of . 
 As for compact manifolds  without boundary one can see that a compact connected manifold with boundary is orientable if and only if  is non-zero, in which case it is again isomorphic to , &#91; Dold1995 &#93;. The choice of a generator is called a relative fundamental class and again this fixes an orientation of . 
 Our at the first glance slightly ad libitum looking convention is made in such a way that the following holds:
 
 
 Theorem 8.1 . Let  be a compact oriented -dimensional manifold with boundary. If  is the fundamental class compatible with the orientation, then  is the the fundamental class compatible with the induced orientation of the boundary as defined above.
 
 
 Since the proof of this result is not in standard text books (to my knowledge), we give it here.
 
 
 Proof. Since the orientation is given locally (we use the homological formulation) it is enough to show that if we consider the local orientation of  in a chart near the boundary, the boundary operator maps it to the local orientation of  in the restriction of this chart to the boundary. Here we choose the chart in such a way, that the orientation of  corresponds to the standard orientation of  (if not change your atlas by a reflection in ). 
 Thus we consider  and the local orientation given by the standard basis of . Since we work with the half space we map the simplex constructed by the standard basis with edges , so that it is spanned instead by . We denote this simplex by . The class represented by this simplex in  for some  in the inner of the simplex is the same as that of  given by the standard orientation of . If we begin with the fundamental class , consider its image under the boundary operator in  and pass to the local orientation at , then it is represented by the restriction of  to the boundary of . More precisely , where  corresponds to the simplex spanned by the corresponding vectors, and the local orientation in  at  corresponding to the image of the fundamental class in  is given by . But this is the negative of the local orientation of  given by the standard basis. This finishes the proof and explains why we took the negative orientation in our construction of the induced orientation in terms of an atlas.
 
  
 
 9 Orientation of products 
 
 
 Given two oriented manifolds there is an obvious way to orient their product by choosing the product atlas. If  is smooth and we have given orientations as tangential orientations, we note that  is isomorphic to  and the isomorphism is induced by the differential of the projections and then the product orientation is given by the juxtaposition of the orientations of  and . 
 Similarly if  and  are oriented by a continuos family of local homological orientations, we note that  is isomorphic to , this isomorphism from the latter to the first is given by the cross product . By definition of the cross product of the local homological orientation given by the standard basis of  with the local homological orientation given by the standard basis of  is the local homological orientation given by the standard basis of . Thus the different concepts of product orientations given by the product of an atlas and by the product of local homological orientations agree also. 
 As a consequence for compact oriented manifolds equipped with fundamental classes the cross product of the fundamental classes corresponds to the product of the orientations induced by the fundamental classes.
 
 10 Orientation of complex manifold 
 
 
 An  -dimensional complex manifold is a topological manifold together with an atlas  such that the coordinate changes are holomorphic maps. Given such an atlas the charts considered as maps to  have orientation preserving coordinate changes, since a complex matrix considered as a real matrix has determinant , the square of the norm of the complex determinant. Thus a complex manifold considered as a real manifold has this way a canonical orientation.

																 This article is about a concept from differential geometry. For the algebraic concept, see Zariski–Riemann space . 
 Not to be confused with Riemann surface . 
 In differential geometry , a (smooth) Riemannian manifold or (smooth) Riemannian space ( M , g ) is a real smooth manifold M equipped with an inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from point to point in the sense that if X and Y are vector fields on M , then is a smooth function . The family of inner products is called a Riemannian metric (tensor) . These terms are named after the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann . The study of Riemannian manifolds comprises the subject called Riemannian geometry . 
 A Riemannian metric (tensor) makes it possible to define various geometric notions on a Riemannian manifold, such as angles , lengths of curves , areas (or volumes ), curvature , gradients of functions and divergence of vector fields .

 [ edit ] Introduction 
 In 1828, Carl Friedrich Gauss proved his Theorema Egregium ( remarkable theorem in Latin), establishing an important property of surfaces. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring distances along paths on the surface. That is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be embedded in 3-dimensional space. See differential geometry of surfaces . Bernhard Riemann extended Gauss's theory to higher dimensional spaces called manifolds in a way that also allows distances and angles to be measured and the notion of curvature to be defined, again in a way that was intrinsic to the manifold and not dependent upon its embedding in higher-dimensional spaces. Albert Einstein used the theory of Riemannian manifolds to develop his General Theory of Relativity . In particular, his equations for gravitation are restrictions on the curvature of space. 
 [ edit ] Overview 
 The tangent bundle of a smooth manifold M assigns to each fixed point of M a vector space called the tangent space , and each tangent space can be equipped with an inner product. If such a collection of inner products on the tangent bundle of a manifold varies smoothly as one traverses the manifold, then concepts that were defined only pointwise at each tangent space can be extended to yield analogous notions over finite regions of the manifold. For example, a smooth curve α( t ): [0, 1] → M has tangent vector α′( t 0 ) in the tangent space T M (α( t 0 )) at any point t 0 ∈ (0, 1), and each such vector has length ‖α′( t 0 )‖, where ‖·‖ denotes the norm induced by the inner product on T M (α( t 0 )). The integral of these lengths gives the length of the curve α: 
 
 
 
 Smoothness of α( t ) for t in [0, 1] guarantees that the integral L (α) exists and the length of this curve is defined. 
 In many instances, in order to pass from a linear-algebraic concept to a differential-geometric one, the smoothness requirement is very important. 
 Every smooth submanifold of R n has an induced Riemannian metric g : the inner product on each tangent space is the restriction of the inner product on R n . In fact, as follows from the Nash embedding theorem , all Riemannian manifolds can be realized this way. In particular one could define Riemannian manifold as a metric space which is isometric to a smooth submanifold of R n with the induced intrinsic metric , where isometry here is meant in the sense of preserving the length of curves. This definition might theoretically not be flexible enough, but it is quite useful to build the first geometric intuitions in Riemannian geometry . 
 [ edit ] Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces 
 Usually a Riemannian manifold is defined as a smooth manifold with a smooth section of the positive-definite quadratic forms on the tangent bundle . Then one has to work to show that it can be turned to a metric space: 
 If γ: [ a , b ] → M is a continuously differentiable curve in the Riemannian manifold M , then we define its length L (γ) in analogy with the example above by 
 
 
 
 With this definition of length, every connected Riemannian manifold M becomes a metric space (and even a length metric space ) in a natural fashion: the distance d ( x , y ) between the points x and y of M is defined as 
 
 d ( x , y ) = inf { L(γ)&#160;: γ is a continuously differentiable curve joining x and y }. 
 
 Even though Riemannian manifolds are usually "curved," there is still a notion of "straight line" on them: the geodesics . These are curves which locally join their points along shortest paths . 
 Assuming the manifold is compact , any two points x and y can be connected with a geodesic whose length is d ( x , y ). Without compactness, this need not be true. For example, in the punctured plane R 2 &#160;\&#160;{0}, the distance between the points (−1,&#160;0) and (1,&#160;0) is 2, but there is no geodesic realizing this distance. 
 [ edit ] Properties 
 In Riemannian manifolds, the notions of geodesic completeness , topological completeness and metric completeness are the same: that each implies the other is the content of the Hopf–Rinow theorem . 
 [ edit ] Riemannian metrics 
 Let M be a differentiable manifold of dimension n . A Riemannian metric on M is a family of ( positive definite ) inner products 
 
 
 
 such that, for all differentiable vector fields X , Y on M , 
 
 
 
 defines a smooth function M &#160;→&#160; R . 
 More formally, a Riemannian metric g is a symmetric (0,2)-tensor that is positive definite (i.e. g ( X , X ) &gt; 0 for all tangent vectors X ≠ 0). 
 In a system of local coordinates on the manifold M given by n real-valued functions x 1 , x 2 , …, x n , the vector fields 
 
 
 
 give a basis of tangent vectors at each point of M . Relative to this coordinate system, the components of the metric tensor are, at each point p , 
 
 
 
 Equivalently, the metric tensor can be written in terms of the dual basis {d x 1 , …, d x n } of the cotangent bundle as 
 
 
 
 Endowed with this metric, the differentiable manifold ( M , g ) is a Riemannian manifold . 
 [ edit ] Examples 
 
 With identified with e i = (0, …, 1, …, 0), the standard metric over an open subset U ⊂ R n is defined by 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then g is a Riemannian metric, and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Equipped with this metric, R n is called Euclidean space of dimension n and g ij can is called the (canonical) Euclidean metric . 
 
 
 Let ( M , g ) be a Riemannian manifold and N ⊂ M be a submanifold of M . Then the restriction of g to vectors tangent along N defines a Riemannian metric over N . 
 More generally, let f : M n → N n + k be an immersion . Then, if N has a Riemannian metric, f induces a Riemannian metric on M via pullback : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is then a metric; the positive definiteness follows of the injectivity of the differential of an immersion. 
 
 
 Let ( M , g M ) be a Riemannian manifold, h : M n + k → N k be a differentiable map and q ∈ N be a regular value of h (the differential dh ( p ) is surjective for all p ∈ h −1 ( q )). Then h −1 ( q )⊂ M is a submanifold of M of dimension n . Thus h −1 ( q ) carries the Riemannian metric induced by inclusion. 
 
 
 In particular, consider the following map&#160;: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then, 0 is a regular value of h and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is the unit sphere S n − 1 ⊂ R n . The metric induced from R n on S n − 1 is called the canonical metric of S n − 1 . 
 
 
 Let M 1 and M 2 be two Riemannian manifolds and consider the cartesian product M 1 × M 2 with the product structure. Furthermore, let π 1 : M 1 × M 2 → M 1 and π 2 : M 1 × M 2 → M 2 be the natural projections. For ( p,q ) ∈ M 1 × M 2 , a Riemannian metric on M 1 × M 2 can be introduced as follows&#160;: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The identification
 
 
 
 
 
 
 allows us to conclude that this defines a metric on the product space. 
 
 
 The torus S 1 × … × S 1 = T n possesses for example a Riemannian structure obtained by choosing the induced Riemannian metric from R 2 on the circle S 1 ⊂ R 2 and then taking the product metric. The torus T n endowed with this metric is called the flat torus . 
 
 
 Let g 0 , g 1 be two metrics on M . Then, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is also a metric on M . 
 
 [ edit ] The pullback metric 
 If f : M → N is a differentiable map and ( N , g N ) a Riemannian manifold, then the pullback of g N along f is a quadratic form on the tangent space of M . The pullback is the quadratic form f * g N on TM defined for v , w ∈ T p M by 
 
 
 
 where df(v) is the pushforward of v by f . 
 The quadratic form f * g N is in general only a semi definite form because df can have a kernel. If f is a diffeomorphism , or more generally an immersion , then it defines a Riemannian metric on M , the pullback metric. In particular, every embedded smooth submanifold inherits a metric from being embedded in a Riemannian manifold, and every covering space inherits a metric from covering a Riemannian manifold. 
 [ edit ] Existence of a metric 
 Every paracompact differentiable manifold admits a Riemannian metric. To prove this result, let M be a manifold and {( U α , φ( U α ))|α ∈ I } a locally finite atlas of open subsets U of M and diffeomorphisms onto open subsets of R n 
 
 
 
 Let τ α be a differentiable partition of unity subordinate to the given atlas. Then define the metric g on M by 
 
 
 
 where g can is the Euclidean metric. This is readily seen to be a metric on M . 
 [ edit ] Isometries 
 Let ( M , g M ) and ( N , g N ) be two Riemannian manifolds, and f : M → N be a diffeomorphism. Then, f is called an isometry , if 
 
 
 
 or pointwise 
 
 
 
 Moreover, a differentiable mapping f : M → N is called a local isometry at p ∈ M if there is a neighbourhood U ⊂ M , p ∈ U , such that f : U → f(U) is a diffeomorphism satisfying the previous relation. 
 [ edit ] Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces 
 A connected Riemannian manifold carries the structure of a metric space whose distance function is the arclength of a minimizing geodesic . 
 Specifically, let ( M , g ) be a connected Riemannian manifold. Let c : [ a,b ] → M be a parametrized curve in M , which is differentiable with velocity vector c ′. The length of c is defined as 
 
 
 
 By change of variables , the arclength is independent of the chosen parametrization. In particular, a curve [ a,b ] → M can be parametrized by its arc length. A curve is parametrized by arclength if and only if for all . 
 The distance function d &#160;: M × M → [0,∞) is defined by 
 
 
 
 where the infimum extends over all differentiable curves γ beginning at p &#160;∈&#160; M and ending at q &#160;∈&#160; M . 
 This function d satisfies the properties of a distance function for a metric space. The only property which is not completely straightforward is to show that d ( p , q )&#160;=&#160;0 implies that p &#160;=&#160; q . For this property, one can use a normal coordinate system , which also allows one to show that the topology induced by d is the same as the original topology on M . 
 [ edit ] Diameter 
 The diameter of a Riemannian manifold M is defined by 
 
 
 
 The diameter is invariant under global isometries. Furthermore, the Heine–Borel property holds for (finite-dimensional) Riemannian manifolds: M is compact if and only if it is complete and has finite diameter. 
 [ edit ] Geodesic completeness 
 A Riemannian manifold M is geodesically complete if for all p ∈ M , the exponential map is defined for all , i.e. if any geodesic starting from p is defined for all values of the parameter t ∈ R . The Hopf-Rinow theorem asserts that M is geodesically complete if and only if it is complete as a metric space . 
 If M is complete, then M is non-extendable in the sense that it is not isometric to an open proper submanifold of any other Riemannian manifold. The converse is not true, however: there exist non-extendable manifolds which are not complete.

   The definitions I am using are 

 
 a manifold with boundary is something locally homeomorphic to $(0,1] \times \mathbb{R}^n$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
 an oriented manifold is one where the transition functions between any two charts have positive Jacobian. 
 

 Its clear that $[0,1]$ is a manifold with boundary. Is it oriented? I seem to be getting the conclusion that it is not, because around $0$, the local chart is $x \to 1-x$, and around $1$ the local chart is $x \to x$, and these have opposite orientations. But Stokes theorem surely should apply to this setting and reduce to the fundamental theorem of calculus. Recall that Stokes theorem says that if $M$ is a compact oriented $n$-manifold with boundary $\partial M$ with the induced orientation, and $\omega$ is an $n-1$ form, then $$\int_{\partial M} \omega = \int_M d\omega.$$
Taking $\omega=f$ a zero form, i.e., function and $M=[0,1]$, I expect to recover $$f(1)-f(0) = \int_0^1 f&#39;(x) dx ,$$ so $[0,1]$ I suspect is an oriented manifold with boundary, but I'm not seeing exactly why. 

 In a related vein, I think I can see intuitively that the closed unit disk is an oriented manifold with boundary, and then Stokes gives Green's theorem. 

 @Bill, in a comment below you wrote "the chart containing 1 orients the interval 0→1." Well, let me be more precise: the chart $U_1=(0,1] \to (0,1]$ given by $x \to x$ (for $x \in (0,1]$) orients $(0,1]$. I cannot extend this particular chart to include $0$ because then $[0,1]$ would not be a homeomorphic to $(0,1]$ which is in my definition of manifold with closed boundary. To get a chart including the zero, I need to include another chart, e.g $U_2=[0,1)$ and then the map $x \to 1-x$ would be a homeomorphism $U_2 \to (0,1]$ as required in the definition I am using for manifold with boundary. But now, these charts have opposite orientations. I don't know how to come up with two (or more) charts that do not give opposite orientations. The definition of manifold with boundary I am using is the one on p.25 of Voisin's Hodge Theory and Complex Analytic Geometry 1, and its easily seen to be equivalent to the more standard one homeomorphic to an open subset of the closed upper half plane. I agree with your second commment.

   $[0,1]$ is definitely a manifold with boundary which can be oriented (any 1-dimensional manifold with boundary can be oriented). Your charts are incompatible. The chart containing 1 orients the interval $0 \to 1$ while the the chart about 0 orients $0 \leftarrow 1$. I&#39;m not sure exactly what definition you&#39;re using for orientation but any closed interval is an orientable manifold with boundary. &ndash; Bill Cook Dec 24 '11 at 21:39

   Also, (it seems you&#39;re fighting with some formalism problem so this might not be that helpful) if you orient a curve with boundary (1-dimensional manifold with boundary), the orientation on that curve induces a &quot;-&quot; on the start point and a &quot;+&quot; on the end point (&quot;-&quot; for leaving the point and &quot;+&quot; for entering the point). This is why the fundamental theorems of calculus and line integrals have $f(end)-f(start)$. &ndash; Bill Cook Dec 24 '11 at 21:43

  Ok, this is a bit late and you might have solved it already by yourself. But I stumbled upon this question on Google because I too had this problem, I'm hoping people with the same problem can find this solution. There is a quirk that few books discuss which only happens in dimension 1. With your definition (and most) the interval $[0,1]$ does not have an oriented atlas. This is easy to see because, as you said, the local charts at the endpoints have opposite orientations and any other collection of charts is going to flip monotonicity at some point and at this point the orientations will be incompatible. 

 To fix this you define a manifold with boundary distinguishing two cases (sorry to change your definition, but it's only a superficial change): in dimension $n &gt;1$ a (topological) manifold with boundary is a second countable Hausdorff topological space locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{H}^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n\,:\, x^n \geq 0\}$ (this is just the usual definition). If $n = 1$ then you define a $1$-dimensional topological manifold with boundary as a second countable Hausdorff topological space where at each point $p$ there is a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ and a map $\varphi : U \to \mathbb{R}$ where $\varphi(U)$ is open in either $\mathbb{H}^1$ or $\mathbb{H}^1_{-} = \{x \in \mathbb{R} : x \leq 0\}$ with the relative topology and $\varphi_{|U}$ is a homeomorphism. 

 Now you define everything else (smooth manifold, orientation, etc.) as usual. With this definition you can give $[0,1]$ the structure of a smooth manifold with boundary using the charts: $(U = [0,1)$, $\varphi(x) = x)$ and $(V = (0,1]$, $\psi(x) = x-1)$, which are clearly compatible orientation-wise. 

 This is the approach given in Loring Tu: An introduction to manifolds, he specially discusses this difficulty in page 254; example 22.9.

 1 Introduction 
 
 
 According to the general definition of manifold, a manifold of dimension 1 is a topological space which is second countable (i.e., its topological structure has a countable base), satisfies the Hausdorff axiom (any two different points have disjoint neighborhoods) and each point of which has a neighbourhood homeomorphic either to the real line  or to the half-line .
 Manifolds of dimension 1 are called curves , but this name may lead to a confusion, because many mathematical objects share it. Even in the context of topology, the term curve may mean not only a manifold of dimension 1 with an additional structure, but, for instance, an immersion of a smooth manifold of dimension 1 to Euclidean space . To be on the safe side, we use an unambiguous term manifold of dimension  or  -manifold .
 The material presented below is not well represented in the literature. This happened, probably, because it is considered too simple. It was difficult to find appropriate references. The proofs are really elementary, but use ideas that are barely applicable in similar high-dimensional situations. That's why most the results below are provided with proofs.
 Besides the adjacent field of dynamics, there is no research activity related to topology of 1-manifold. The dynamical topics have been left outside the scope of this text. Actions of finite groups on 1-manifolds are on this side of the natural borderline, and a complete account of them is presented, while no infinite group actions are considered.
 For other expositions about -manifolds, see &#91; Ghys2001 &#93;, &#91; Gale1987 &#93; and also &#91; Fuks&Rokhlin1984 , Sections 3.1.1.16-19&#93;.

 2.2 Doubling 
 
 
 If  is an -manifold and  is its boundary (i.e., the set of points of  that do not have neighborhoods homeomorphic to the Euclidean space ), then the quotient of the disjoint union  of two copies of  by the identity map 
 is an -manifold with empty boundary, called the double of  and denoted by . 
 This operation is well defined up to homeomorphism. It gives a natural embedding of a manifold with boundary into a manifold without boundary (i.e., with empty boundary) and allows one to reduce many problems about manifolds with boundary to problems about manifolds without boundary.

 3 Topological classification 
 3.1 Reduction to classification of connected manifolds 
 
 
 The following elementary facts hold for -manifolds of any dimension :
 Any manifold is homeomorphic to the disjoint sum of its connected components.
 A connected component of an -manifold is a -manifold.
 Two manifolds are homeomorphic iff there exists a one-to-one correspondence between their components 
such that the corresponding components are homeomorphic.
 
 3.2 Topological classification of connected 1-manifolds 
 
 
 
 Theorem 3.1 . 
Any connected -manifold is homeomorphic to one of the following four manifolds: 
 
 real line  
 half-line  
 circle 
 closed interval .
 
 No two of these manifolds are homeomorphic to each other. 
 
 
 3.3 Characterizing the topological type of a connected 1-manifold 
 
 
 
 Theorem 3.2 . 
 
 Any connected non-compact -manifold without boundary is homeomorphic to  .
 Any connected non-compact -manifold with non-empty boundary is homeomorphic to .
 Any connected closed -manifold is homeomorphic to  .
 Any connected compact -manifold with non-empty boundary is homeomorphic to .
 
 
 Thus, for connected 1-manifolds, two invariants, compactness and presence of boundary, form a complete system of topological invariants. Each of the invariants takes two values.
 Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 above solve the topological classification problem for 1-manifolds in the most effective way that one can desire. Surprisingly, many Topology textbooks manage not to mention this fundamental result.
 
 3.4 About proofs of the classification theorems 
 
 
 The proofs of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 above are elementary. They can be found, e.g., in &#91; Fuks&Rokhlin1984 , Sections 3.1.1.16-19&#93;. In the case of 1-manifolds without boundary, the proofs are based on the following simple lemmas:
 
 
 Lemma 3.3 . Any connected -manifold covered by two open sets homeomorphic to  is homeomorphic either to  or to .
 
 
 Under assumptions of Lemma 3.3 , the 1-manifold is homeomorphic to  iff the intersection of two open sets is connected, and it is homeomorphic to  iff the intersection consists of two connected components (the intersection cannot have more than two components).
 
 
 Lemma 3.4 . If a topological space  can be represented as the union of a nondecreasing sequence of open subsets, all homeomorphic to , then  is homeomorphic to .
 
 
 From the topological classification for 1-manifolds without boundary, the classification for 1-manifolds with non-empty boundary is obtained using the doubling operation. 
 
 3.5 Corollary: homotopy classification 
 
 
 
 Theorem 3.5 . 
Each connected -manifold is either contractible, or homotopy equivalent to circle.
 
 
 This follows immediately from Theorem 3.1 .
 
 3.6 Corollary: Cobordant 0-manifolds 
 
 
 
 Theorem 3.6 . 
A compact -manifold  bounds a compact -manifold iff the number of points in  is even. 
 
 
 
 Corollary 3.7 . 
Two compact -manifolds are cobordant iff their numbers of points are congruent modulo .
 
 
 3.7 Characterizing connected 1-manifolds in terms of separating points 
 
 
 A subset  of a topological space  is said to separate  if  can be presented as a 
union of two disjoint open sets. 
 
 
 Theorem 3.8 . (See &#91; Moore1920 &#93;.)
Let  be a connected compact Hausdorff second countable topological space.
 
 If every two points separate , then  is homeomorphic to the circle.
 If each point, with two exceptions, separates , then  is homeomorphic to .
 
 
 Any point  splits  to two disjoint open rays  and . 
 
 
 Theorem 3.9 . (See &#91; Ward1936 &#93;.)
Let  be a connected locally compact Hausdorff second countable topological space. 
 
 If the complement of each point in  consists of two connected components, then  is homeomorphic to  .
 If  contains a point  such that  is connected and  consists of two connected components for each  , , then  is homeomorphic to .
 
 
 4 Orders and orientations 
 4.1 Interval topology 
 
 
 Most properties specific for 1-manifolds can be related to the fact that the topological structure on a connected 1-manifold is defined by linear or cyclic ordering of its points. 
 Open intervals  form a base of the standard topology on . This way of introducing a topological structure can be applied in any (linearly) ordered set  (though in a general linearly ordered set one should include into the base, together with open intervals , also open rays  and ). On  and , the standard topology is induced from the standard topology on  , and can be described in terms of the order. 
 
 
 Theorem 4.1 . 
Every connected non-closed -manifold admits exactly two linear orders defining its topology.
 
 
 
 Proof. 
A linear order  on a set  is encoded in the system of rays  for .
 By Theorem 3.2 , a connected non-closed 1-manifold is homeomorphic either to , or , or . On each of these 1-manifolds there are two linear orders,  and , defining the topology. For these orders, the rays  and  are defined by the topology: they are just the connected components of .
 For any other linear order  defining the same topology on , the rays  and  are open and intersect the connected components  and  of  in disjoint open sets. By connectedness of  and , one of them coincides with , the other with . Hence,  coincides with one of the standard orders, either with , or .
 
  
 
 4.2 Orientations 
 
 
 An orientation of a 1-manifold can be interpreted via linear orderings on its open subsets homeomorphic to  or . 
An orientation of  or  is nothing but one of the two linear orders defining the topological structure. 
 Relation to the general homological definition of orientation . 
Recall that in high dimensional situations orientation of an open set  is defined as a coherent choice of generators in homology groups  for . In our case  and the group  is generated by a homology class of a singular cycle consisting of a single singular 1-simplex , which is an embedding with the image covering . There are two generators: one is represented by a monotone increasing , another, by a monotone decreasing . A choice of linear order on  allows to distinguish one of the generators of : namely, the one represented by  which is monotone increasing with respect to the order chosen on . 
 For extending the notion of orientation to a general 1-manifold, one needs to globalize the idea of linear order. It can be done in several ways. 
 For example, due to the topological classification, one can restrict to just four model 1-manifolds: , ,  and . For ,  and , an orientation still can be defined as a linear order determining the topology of the manifold. For  this approach does not work, but can be adjusted: instead of linear order one can rely on cyclic orders that define the topology . However, this is a bit awkward, as cyclic orders are more cumbersome than usual linear orders. 
 There is a more conceptual approach, which imitates the classical definition of orientations of differentiable manifolds, but relies, instead of coordinate charts, on local linear orders.
 Let  be a 1-manifold. A local order of  is a pair consisting of an open set  homeomorphic to  or  and a linear order on  defining the topology on . Two local orders ,  are said to agree if on any connected component  of  the orders  and  induce the same order.
 Denote by  the set of all local orders of . 
An orientation on  is a map  such that for any  and the restrictions of  and  to any connected component of  coincide if  and do not coincide if . 
 
 
 Obvious Lemma 4.2 . Let  be a collection of open sets in a -manifold X homeomorphic to  and let for any open set  homeomorphic to  or  there exist  such that  is connected. If each  is equipped with a linear order  defining the topology on  such that the local orders  and  agree for any , then there exists a unique orientation  on  such that  for any  . Moreover any orientation on  comes from such coherent linear orders  on all elements of .
 
 
 
 Theorem 4.3 . 
On any connected -manifold there exists exactly two orientations.
 
 
 
 Proof. If  is a non-closed connected 1-manifold, then for  satisfying the hypothesis of Lemma 4.2 we can take a collection consisting of a single element . If  is closed connected 1-manifold, then for  we can take the collection of complements of single points. Then the intersection  for any  consists of two connected components homeomorphic to . We can choose stereographic projections as homeomorphisms of them to  in such a way that the transition mapping from one of these charts to another one is . It is monotone increasing on each of the rays  and . Therefore the orders obtained on complements of points via these stereographic projections from the standard order  on  agree with each other and we can apply Lemma 4.2 . 
 
  
 
 
 Corollary 4.4 . 
Any -manifold admits an orientation. If a -manifold consists of  connected components, then it admits exactly  orientations.
 
 
 
 
 4.3 Self-homeomorphisms 
 
 
 
 Theorem 4.5 . 
A map  is a homeomorphism iff  is a monotone bijection.
 
 
 
 Proof. Let  be a homeomorphism. First, observe that  maps every ray to a ray. Indeed, 
for any , the map  induces a homeomorphism . 
The rays  and  are connected components of . 
Therefore their images are connected components  and  of . 
 Observe that rays have the same direction iff one of them is contained in the other one. Therefore two rays of the same direction are mapped by  to rays with the same direction. Thus rays  are mapped either all to rays  or all to . Thus  is monotone. 
 Let  be a monotone bijection. Then the image and preimage under  of any open interval are open intervals. Therefore, both  and  are continuous, and hence  is a homeomorphism.
 
  
 
 The following theorem can be proved similarly or can be deduced from Theorem 4.5 
 
 
 Theorem 4.6 . 
 
 A map  is a homeomorphism iff  is a monotone bijection.
 A map  is a homeomorphism iff  is a monotone increasing bijection.
 A map  is a homeomorphism iff  is a bijection that either preserves or reverses the cyclic order of points on . 
 
 
 A self-homeomorphism  of a connected 1-manifold maps an orientation 
 of  to some orientation, which is either  or  (as a connected 
1-manifold,  has just these two orientations). Whether  maps  to itself
or to the opposite orientation  does not depend on : it maps  to  
iff it maps  to . We say that  is orientation preserving if
it maps any orientation of  to itself and orientation reversing if
if it maps any orientation of  to the opposite orientation. 
 The half-line  does not admit a self-homeomorphism reversing orientation. Any connected 1-manifold non-homeomorphic to  admits an orientation reversing map. Thus,  is chiral and connected 1-manifolds non-homeomorphic to  are amphicheiral .
 Thus, there are 5 topological types of oriented connected 1-manifolds: the topological type of the non-oriented half-line splits into the oriented topological types of  and  with the orientations induced by the standard order.  
 
 5 Invariants 
 5.1 Basic invariants 
 
 
 As follows from the Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 above, the following invariants 
 
 the number of connected components, 
 the compactness of each connected component, 
 and the number of boundary points of each connected component
 
 determine the topological type of a 1-manifold. 
 
 5.2 Homotopy invariants 
 
 
 The homotopy invariants of 1-manifolds are extremely simple. All homology and homotopy groups of dimensions  are trivial. The fundamental group 
 is infinite cyclic group, if the connected component of  containing  is homeomorphic to circle, and trivial otherwise.
 
 5.3 Homology invariants 
 
 
 Let  be a 1-manifold with a finite number of connected components. By Theorem 3.1 , it is homeomorphic to a disjoint union 
 
of some numbers of copies of , ,  and :  
 Then  is a free abelian group of rank equal to the number  of all connected components of  and 
 is a free abelian group of rank equal to the number  of closed (compact without boundary) components of . 
 Relative homology groups:  is a free abelian group of rank equal to the number  of connected components of  without boundary;
 is a free abelian group of rank equal to the number  of compact components of . 
So,
 
  
 Numbers , , , and  and the topological type of  can be recovered from the ranks of these groups. 
 Above by homology we mean homology with compact support. For homology with closed support (Borel-Moore homology): 
 
  
 An orientation of a 1-manifold  gives rise to the fundamental class of , which belongs to . 
Cap-product by this class defines various versions of the Poincaré duality isomorphisms between usual cohomology 
(recall that the usual cohomology has closed support) and the relative 
Borel-Moore homology of the complementary dimension. So there are isomorphisms
 
  
 A local coefficient system on a 1-manifold homeomorphic to the circle, may be non-trivial. E.g., if the local coefficient system over  with fibre
  has non-trivial monodromy, then all the homology groups are trivial. 
 
 5.4 Euler characteristics 
 
 
 The Euler characteristic of  is 1. The Euler characteristic of  is 0. 
 Any closed 1-manifold has Euler characteristic 0. 
The Euler characteristic of any compact 1-manifold is half the number of its boundary points. 
 When it comes to non-compact spaces, the notion of Euler characteristic becomes ambiguous. 
A non-compact space has many Euler characteristics. The notion of Euler characteristic depends
on the properties that one wants to preserve. If one wants to have invariance under homotopy equivalences,
then the additivity would be lost. If one wants to keep additivity, then it is not the alternating sum of Betti numbers. If one wants to keep topological invariance and additivity, then 
 , similarly . 
 For not necessarily compact 1-manifolds probably most useful is the Euler characteristic which is defined as the alternating sum of the ranks of homology groups with closed support (Borel-Moore homology). It is additive and a topological invariant. The only property which may confuse a person with purely compact experience is that it is not homotopy invariant. With this Euler characteristic,  and . 
 
 5.5 Tangent bundle invariants 
 
 
 The tangent bundles of 1-manifolds are trivial. Thus all the characteristic classes are trivial.
 
 6 Additional structures 
 6.1 Triangulations 
 
 
 A triangulation of a 1-manifold  is a locally finite 
cover of  by subspaces homeomorphic to , any two of which have disjoint interiors at most one common point. 
The subspaces are assumed to be equipped with affine structure or, rather,
with homeomorphisms to . The subspaces are called edges or
 -simplices , the
images of the endpoints of  are called vertices or  -simplices .
 Any 1-manifold admits a triangulation.
A triangulation of a non-compact connected 1-manifold is unique up to homeomorphism.
 A compact 1-manifold has non-homeomorphic triangulations, but they are easy to classify up to homeomorphism.
On the circle the topological type of a triangulation is defined by the number of 1-simplices. This number can take
any integral value . Similarly, the topological type of a triangulation of  is defined by the number of 1-simplices, which can take any positive integral value. 
 
 6.2 Smooth structures 
 
 
 Any -manifold admits a smooth structure of any class . 
 If smooth 1-manifolds  and  are homeomorphic, then they are also diffeomorphic. Moreover, 
 
 
 Theorem 6.1 . 
Any homeomorphism between two smooth -manifolds can be approximated in the -topology by a diffeomorphism.
 
 
 
 Proof. 
By Theorems 4.5 and 4.6 , a homeomorphism is monotone in the appropriate sense. Choose a net of points in the source such that the image of each of them is sufficiently close to the images of its neighbors. Take a smooth monotone bijection coinciding with the homeomorphism at the chosen points. 
 
  
 
 6.3 Metrics and intrinsic metrics 
 
 
 Recall that any manifold is metrizable . On a connected manifold, a metric defining its topology can be replaced by 
an intrinsic metric defining the same topology. (Recall that a metric on a path-connected space is said to be intrinsic if the distance between any two points is equal to the infimum of lengths of paths connecting the points, and that the length of a path  in a metric space  with metric  is 
 .)
 A connected 1-manifold with an intrinsic metric is defined up to isometry by the diameter of the space. Recall that the diameter of a metric space  with metric  is  .
 For each value of the diameter and each homeomorphism type of a connected 1-manifold with intrinsic metric there is a unique standard model: 
 
 
 Theorem 6.2 . 
A 1-manifold  with intrinsic metric and diameter  is isometric to
 
  with the metric induced from the standard metric on  and any ; 
  with the metric induced from the standard metric on  and any ; 
 the circle  with the intrinsic metric defined by the lengths of paths on the circle measured in  and any ; 
  with the metric induced from the standard metric on  and any . 
 
 
 The isometries to the standard models can be constructed using distances from some points. For example, for a connected 1-manifold  homeomorphic 
to  equipped with an intrinsic metric, the distance to the only boundary point defines a canonical isometry  .
 An intrinsic metric on a connected 1-manifold defines a unique smooth structure on the manifold, namely, the smooth structure induced by the isometry to the corresponding standard model from the list above. 
 
 7 Constructions 
 7.1 Surgery 
 
 
 Any compact 1-manifold can be transformed by surgeries to any other 1-manifold with the same boundary.
 If two compact 1-manifolds with the same boundary are oriented and the induced orientations on the boundary coincide, then the surgery can be chosen to preserve the orientation (this means that the corresponding cobordism is an oriented 2-manifold and its orientation induces on the boundary the given orientation on one of the 1-manifolds and the orientation opposite to the given one on the other 1-manifold).
 An index 1 surgery preserving orientation on a closed 1-manifold changes the number of connected components by 1.
An index 1 surgery on a closed 1-manifold, which does not preserve any orientation, preserves the number of connected components. 
 
 7.2 Connected sums 
 
 
 The notion of connected sum is defined for 1-manifolds, but the connectivity of the outcome is different in dimension 1 compared to other dimensions. 
Indeed the term connected sum can be misleading in dimension 1 since a connected sum
of connected 1-manifolds may be not connected. For example a connected sum of two 
copies of  is a disjoint sum of two copies of .
 Note that connected sum is only a well defined operation on oriented manifolds and one has to be careful with the orientations. For example 
 
  
 8 Groups of self-homeomorphisms 
 8.1 Mapping class groups 
 
 
 Recall that the mapping class group of a manifold  is the quotient group of the group  of all homeomorphisms  by the normal subgroup of homeomorphisms isotopic to the identity.
In other words, the mapping class group of  is .
 An orientation reversing homeomorphism cannot be isotopic to an orientation preserving homeomorphism. 
For auto-homeomorphisms of a connected 1-manifold this is the only obstruction to being isotopic: 
 
 
 Theorem 8.1 . 
Any two auto-homeomorphisms of a connected 1-manifold that are either both orientation preserving, or both orientation 
reversing are isotopic. 
 
 
 This is a corollary of the following two obvious lemmas.
 
 
 Lemma 8.2 . On rectilinear isotopy. Let  be one of the following 1-manifolds: , , or . Let  be two monotone bijections that are either both increasing or both decreasing. Then the family  with  
consists of monotone bijections (and hence is an isotopy between  and ).
 
 
 
 Lemma 8.3 . Let  be two bijections that either both preserve or both reverse the standard 
cyclic order of points on . Let  and  coincide at . Then  and  are isotopic via the canonical 
isotopy which is stationary at  and is provided on the complement of  by stereographic projections and the rectilinear isotopy from Lemma 8.2 of the corresponding self-homeomorphisms of . 
 
 
 
 Corollary 8.4 . 
 
and 
 
 
 
 Remark. All the statements in this section remains true, if everywhere the word homeomorphism is replaced by the word diffeomorphism and  is replaced by . 
 
 8.2 Homotopy types of groups of self-homeomorphisms 
 
 
 The group  contains  as a subgroup, which is its deformation retract. This follows from Lemma 8.3 . More precisely, for each point , Lemma 8.3 provides a deformation retraction .
 Similarly, the group of self-homeomorphisms of  isotopic to the identity contains  as a subgroup, which is its deformation retract. 
 The groups of self-homeomorphisms of ,  and  which are isotopic to the identity are contractible. The contraction is provided by the rectilinear isotopy from Lemma 8.2 applied to  and an arbitrary . 
 Thus for each connected 1-manifold  the group of homeomorphisms  isotopic to the identity is homotopy equivalent to .
 
 9 Finite group actions 
 9.1 Invariant intrinsic metric 
 
 
 
 Theorem 9.1 . 
For any effective action of a finite group  on a 1-manifold ,
there exists an intrinsic metric on  invariant under this action.
 
 
 
 Proof. 
Such a metric is created in three steps. 
 
 Choose any metric  on  defining the topology. 
 Symmetrize : define for any  the number . This is a metric and it is invariant under the action.
 Take the intrinsic metric  induced by .
 
  
 
 Since an intrinsic metric on a 1-manifold defines an isometry onto one of the standard models, this gives a equivariant homeomorphism to 
one of the standard connected 1-manifolds with intrinsic metric and action of  by isometries. 
 
 9.2 Free actions 
 
 
 If the action of a finite group  on a 1-manifold is free, then the orbit space  is a 1-manifold and 
the natural projection  is a covering.
 Therefore the theory of coverings gives a simple classification of free finite group actions on 1-manifolds. 
 A contractible 1-manifold has no non-trivial covering. 
Thus, if a free finite group action on 1-manifold  has a contractible orbit space , then  is a disjoint union of copies of  and  permutes these copies. In particular, there is no non-trivial free group action on a connected 1-manifold having contractible orbit space. 
 Coverings  with connected  are in one-to-one correspondence with subgroups of finite indices of . For each  there is one subgroup with index , and hence one -fold covering. The total space is homeomorphic to , and the covering is equivalent to . In the corresponding action, the group is cyclic of order  and acts on  by rotations. 
 In this classification of free finite group actions on connected 1-manifolds, the orbit space plays the main role. However, it is easy to reformulate it with emphasis on the 1-manifold on which the group acts. This is done in the next two theorems. 
 
 
 Theorem 9.2 . 
There is no non-trivial free finite group action on a contractible -manifold.
 
 
 
 Theorem 9.3 . 
If a finite group  acts freely on the circle than  is cyclic. Any finite cyclic group has a linear
free action on . Any free action of a finite cyclic group on  is conjugate to a linear action.
 
 
 9.3 Asymmetry of a half-line 
 
 
 
 Theorem 9.4 . There is no non-trivial action of a finite group on .
 
 
 
 Proof. We will prove that the only homeomorphism  of finite order is the identity. 
Observe first that any homeomorphism  must map a boundary point to a boundary point, and hence it preserves the only boundary point . By Theorem 9.1 , there exists an intrinsic metric invariant under . Therefore,  preserves the distance from the boundary point. However each point on  is uniquely defined by its distance to the boundary point. 
 
  
 
 9.4 Actions on line and segment 
 
 
 
 Theorem 9.5 . 
The only orientation preserving homeomorphism  of finite order is the identity.
 
 
 
 Proof. Fix a homeomorphism  (say, define it by formula ). Consider a homeomorphism . It preserves orientation (since  preserves orientation). So, it is a monotone increasing bijection  of finite order. Since it is increasing, it can be extended to  by letting .
The extended homeomorphism has the same finite order. But by Theorem 9.4 any such homeomorphism is the identity. 
 
  
 
 
 Theorem 9.6 . 
Any orientation reversing homeomorphism  of finite order has order two. It is conjugate to the reflection in a point.
 
 
 
 Proof. An orientation reversing homeomorphism  is a monotone decreasing bijection. Consider the function 
 . It is also monotone decreasing bijection  and hence there exists a unique  such that 
 , that is . 
 The homeomorphism  maps each connected component of  to a connected component of . The connected components are open rays  and . If each of them is mapped to itself, then  defines a homeomorphism of a finite order of the closed rays  and . Then by Theorem 9.4 ,  is identity, which contradicts to our assumption. Thus,  and . Then  preserves the rays, and, by Theorem 9.4 , is identity. Thus  has order two. 
 Choose a homeomorphism . Define function  by formula . It's a homeomorphism. Together,  and  form a homeomorphism . As is easy to check, .
 
  
 
 
 Theorem 9.7 . 
A non-trivial finite group acting effectively on  is a cyclic group of order 2. 
The action of the non-unit element is conjugate to the reflection in a point. 
 
 
 
 Proof. 
As follows from Corollaries 9.5 and 9.6 , any non-trivial
element of the group is an orientation reversing involution. We have to prove that the group contains at most one such element.
Assume that there are two orientation reversing homeomorphisms,  and  of the line . Their composition  preserves orientation. Since it belongs to a finite group, it has finite order. By Theorem 9.5 , it is identity. So,  and hence . But . Therefore  and .
 
  
 
 
 Corollary 9.8 . 
A non-trivial finite group acting effectively on  is a cyclic group of order 2. 
The action of the non-unit element is conjugate to the reflection in a point. 
 
 
 
 Proof. 
Any auto-homeomorphism of  preserves the boundary and the interior of . Hence an effective finite group action on  induces an action of a finite group on the interior of . An auto-homeomorphism of  is recovered from its restriction to the interior. 
Moreover, any auto-homeomorphism of  has a unique extension to an auto-homeomorphism of . The interior  is homeomorphic to . 
 
  
 
 9.5 Actions on the circle 
 
 
 
 Theorem 9.9 . 
Any periodic orientation reversing homeomorphism  is an involution (i.e., has period 2).
It is conjugate to a reflection of  in its diameter.
 
 
 
 Proof. 
Observe first that any orientation reversing auto-homeomorphism of the circle has a fixed point. One can prove this by elementary arguments, but we just refer to the Lefschetz Fixed Point Theorem: the Lefschetz number of such a homeomorphism is 2. 
 Consider the complement of a fixed point. The restriction of the homeomorphism to this complement satisfies the conditions of Theorem 9.6 , which gives the required result.
 
  
 
 Observe that by theorems 9.6 , 9.8 , and 9.9 any non-identity periodic homeomorphism of a connected 1-manifold with a fixed point is an involution reversing orientation. 
 
 
 Theorem 9.10 . 
A periodic non-identity orientation preserving homeomorphism  has no fixed point. It is conjugate to a rotation.
 
 
 
 Proof. 
If if had a fixed point, then we could consider its restriction to the complement of this point, and by Theorem 9.5 would conclude that it is the identity and hence the whole homeomorphism is the identity. 
 For the same reasons, the non-identity powers of our periodic non-identity orientation preserving homeomorphism  have no fixed points. Therefore, these powers form a cyclic group freely acting on . See Theorem 9.3 .
 
  
 
 
 Theorem 9.11 . 
A finite group acting effectively on  is either cyclic or dihedral, and the action is conjugate to a linear one and extends to the standard (linear) action of the orthogonal group . 
The standard actions of cyclic and dihedral groups on circle are provided by the symmetry groups of regular polygons. 
 
 
 
 Proof. 
By Theorem 9.1 , for a finite group action on  there exists an invariant intrinsic metric. By Theorem 6.2 , with this metric  is isometric to the circle defined on the plane  by an equation . Any isometry of this circle belongs to .
 If all the homeomorphisms in the action preserve orientation, then by Theorem 9.10 the action is free, and the result follows from Theorem 9.3 .
 Assume that the action contains an orientation reversing homeomorphism. Then the group acts on the set of orientations. The orientation preserving homeomorphisms form a subgroup of index two. This is a cyclic group as above. Its complement consists of orientation reversing involutions. If the subgroup of orientation preserving homeomorphisms is trivial, then the whole group is of order 2 and the only non-trivial element is an orientation reversing involution, as in Theorem 9.9 above. 
 By Theorem 9.1 , the action is equivalent to an action consisting of isometries of the circle. Its orientation preserving part
consists of rotations and is cyclic, say of order . Its elements are rotations by angles . The orientation reversing elements are reflections in diameters. There are  diameters.
 When , that is the group contains only two orientation preserving homeomorphisms, the whole group is the cartesian product of two cyclic groups of order 2. It is called Klein's Vierergruppe or dihedral group . It contains two reflections in diameters orthogonal to each other, the symmetry in the center of the circle and the identity.
 If the number of orientation preserving homeomorphisms is , then the whole group is called the dihedral group . It is 
the symmetry group of an -sided regular polygon. 
 
  
 
 10 Exotic relatives of 1-manifolds 
 
 
 As we eliminate the Hausdorff or second countability property, the theory becomes somehow weird, but many aspects survive. 
 
 10.1 First examples of non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds 
 
 
 1. Line with two origins. 
In the disjoint union of two copies  identify each point of one of the copies different from the origin with its corresponding point from the second copy:
 . 
This space has a single point for each nonzero real number  and two points  and  taking place of the origin. Each neighborhood of  intersects each neighborhood of , so the space is not Hausdorff.
 2. Branching line. 
This is also a quotient space of two copies of the real line: .
This space has a single point for each real number  and two points ,  for every non-negative . As in the line with two origins above, in this space there is only one pair of points that have no disjoint neighborhoods:  and . 
 
 10.2 Spaces of leaves 
 
 
 At first glance, the examples above of non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds look artificial. However they appear naturally in some classical mathematical contexts. For example, the branching line is homeomorphic to the space of leaves of the following foliation of the plane . The leaves are the vertical lines 
 with  and the graphs  with  and arbitrary real . In other words, the branching line is homeomorphic to the quotient space of  by partition into these lines and graphs. The leaves  correspond to points ,  for non-negative , the leaves  with  correspond to points .
 Similarly, the line with two origins can be identified with the space of leaves of a foliations on the cylinder .
 Although at first glance the space of leaves of a foliation looks substantially more natural than descriptions of non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds as quotient spaces of some 1-manifolds, they are not far away from each other: in either case we deal with factorization of a nice Hausdorff space, but factorization easily gives rise to a non-Hausdorff space. 
 
 10.3 Uncountable family of non-homeomorphic connected non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds 
 
 
 If we enlarge the collection of spaces by eliminating the Hausdorff property, then the number of topological types of connected spaces becomes uncountable. 
 Indeed, one can take the disjoint union of two copies of the line  and identify
an open set in one of them with its copy in the other one by the identity map. The quotient space is connected and satisfies all the
requirements from the definition of 1-manifold except the Hausdorff axiom. In this way one can construct uncountably many pairwise non-homeomorphic spaces. To prove that they are not homeomorphic, one can use, for example, the topological type of the subset formed by those points that do not separate the space.
 
 10.4 Non-orientable non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds 
 
 
 The definition of orientation generalizes straightforwardly to non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds. Unlike usual 1-manifolds, there exist non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds that are non-orientable. 
For example, the quotient space of the open interval  under identification  for  is a non-Hausdorff 1-manifold which does not admit any orientation. 
 
 10.5 Non-orientable homeomorphic, but non-diffeomorphic non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds 
 
 
 The notion of differential structure has a natural generalization to non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds. Let  be a non-Hausdorff 1-manifold, that is a second countable topological space such that each point of  has a neighborhood homeomorphic either to  or . Let  be either a natural number, or . An algebra  of real valued functions on  is called a differential structure of class  or just  -structure if it satisfies the following two conditions:
 
  if  and  is a function of class  (i.e., a function having the first  continuous derivatives , ,...  if  is finite and derivatives of all natural orders if ). 
  if for each  there exists  and a neighborhood  of  such that .
 
 If each  has a neighborhood  and a homeomorphism  of the closure  of  onto  such that  is a restriction of some function  to  and the restriction of any function  to  is a composition of  with some function of class , then the -structure  is called non-singular . A 1-manifold equipped with a non-singular -structures is a  -manifold of dimension 1. 
 Any 1-manifold admits a non-singular -structure, and any two homeomorphic -manifolds of dimension 1 are diffeomorphic. For non-Hausdorff 1-manifold this is not true. 
 Take a pair of monotone decreasing sequences  and  on  convergent to 0. For instance,  and . Then there exists a homeomorphism  with  for all , but there is no such diffeomorphism. Let  and  . By the identity map of  attach one copy of  to another and denote the result by . Similalrly, in the disjoint sum of two copies of  identify by the identity map the copies of  and denote the result by . The homeomorphism  defines a homeomorphism , on the other hand there is no diffeomorphism between  and , because if one existed, it would map  to  (as the sets of separating points) and extend to a diffeomorphism of  mapping  to . 
 
 10.6 Relatives of 1-manifolds without countable base 
 
 
 One can easily construct a topological space which satisfies all the conditions from the definition of 1-manifold except second countability by taking the disjoint sum of an uncountable number of copies of  (or any other 1-manifold). There are more interesting examples, which are connected. Most famous of them is the long line .

																 In mathematics , an n -dimensional differential structure (or differentiable structure ) on a set M makes M into an n -dimensional differential manifold , which is a topological manifold with some additional structure that allows us to do differential calculus on the manifold. If M is already a topological manifold, we require that the new topology be identical to the existing one.

 [ edit ] Definition 
 For a natural number n and some k which may be a non-negative integer or infinity, an n-dimensional C k differential structure  [ 1 ] is defined using a C k -atlas , which is a set of bijections called charts between a collection of subsets of M (whose union is the whole of M ), and a set of open subsets of : 
 
 
 
 which are C k -compatible (in the sense defined below): 
 Each such map provides a way in which certain subsets of the manifold may be viewed as being like open subsets of but the usefulness of this notion depends on to what extent these notions agree when the domains of two such maps overlap. 
 Consider two charts: 
 
 
 
 
 The intersection of the domains of these two functions is: 
 
 
 
 and its map by the two chart maps to the two images: 
 
 
 
 
 The transition map between the two charts is the map between the two images of this intersection under the two chart maps. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Two charts are C k -compatible if 
 
 
 
 are open, and the transition maps 
 
 
 
 have continuous derivatives of order k . If k&#160;=&#160;0 , we only require that the transition maps are continuous, consequently a C 0 -atlas is simply another way to define a topological manifold. If k &#160;=&#160;∞, derivatives of all orders must be continuous. A family of C k -compatible charts covering the whole manifold is a C k -atlas defining a C k differential manifold. Two atlases are C k -equivalent if the union of their sets of charts forms a C k -atlas. In particular, a C k -atlas that is C 0 -compatible with a C 0 -atlas that defines a topological manifold is said to determine a C k differential structure on the topological manifold. The C k equivalence classes of such atlases are the distinct C k differential structures of the manifold . Each distinct differential structure is determined by a unique maximal atlas, which is simply the union of all atlases in the equivalence class. 
 For simplification of language, without any loss of precision, one might just call a maximal C k −atlas on a given set a C k −manifold. This maximal atlas then uniquely determines both the topology and the underlying set, the latter being the union of the domains of all charts, and the former having the set of all these domains as a basis. 
 [ edit ] Existence and uniqueness theorems 
 For 0 &lt; k &lt; ∞ and any n −dimensional C k −manifold, the maximal atlas contains a C ∞ −atlas on the same underlying set by a theorem due to Whitney . However, a given maximal C k −atlas contains distinct maximal C ∞ −atlases whenever n &gt; 0. Anyway, there is a C ∞ −diffeomorphism between any two of these distinct C ∞ −atlases. Thus there is only one class of pairwise smoothly diffeomorphic smooth, i.e. C ∞ −structures in a C k −manifold. A bit loosely, one might express this by saying that the smooth structure is (essentially) unique. The case for k = 0 is different. Namely, there exist topological manifolds which admit no C 1 −structure, a result proved by Kervaire (1960 ), [ 2 ] and later explained in the context of Donaldson's theorem (compare Hilbert's fifth problem ). 
 Smooth structures on an orientable manifold are usually counted modulo orientation-preserving smooth homeomorphisms . There then arises the question whether orientation-reversing diffeomorphisms exist. There is an "essentially unique" smooth structure for any topological manifold of dimension smaller than 4. For compact manifolds of dimension greater than 4, there is a finite number of "smooth types", i.e. equivalence classes of pairwise smoothly diffeomorphic smooth structures. In the case of R n with n ≠ 4, the number of these types in one, whereas for n = 4, there are uncountably many such types. One refers to these by exotic R 4 . 
 [ edit ] Differential structures on spheres of dimension from 1 to 20 
 The following table lists the number of smooth types of the topological m −sphere S m for the values of the dimension m from 1 up to 20. Spheres with a smooth, i.e. C ∞ −differential structure not smoothly diffeomorphic to the usual one are known as exotic spheres .

 It is not currently known how many smooth types the topological 4-sphere S 4 has, except that there is at least one. There may be one, a finite number, or an infinite number. The claim that there is just one is known as the smooth Poincaré conjecture (see generalized Poincaré conjecture ). Most mathematicians believe that this conjecture is false, i.e. that S 4 has more than one smooth type. The problem is connected with the existence of more than one smooth type of the topological 4-disk (or 4-ball). 
 [ edit ] Differential structures on topological manifolds 
 As mentioned above, in dimensions smaller than 4, there is only one differential structure for each topological manifold. That was proved by Johann Radon for dimension 1 and 2, and by Edwin E. Moise in dimension 3. [ 3 ] By using Obstruction theory , Robion Kirby and Laurent Siebenmann [ 4 ] were able to show that the number of PL structures for compact topological manifolds of dimension greater than 4 is finite. John Milnor , Michel Kervaire , and Morris Hirsch proved that the number of smooth structures on a compact PL manifold is finite and agrees with the number of differential structures on the sphere for the same dimension (see the book Asselmeyer-Maluga, Brans chapter 7) By combining these results, the number of smooth structures on a compact topological manifold of dimension not equal to 4 is finite. 
 Dimension 4 is more complicated. For compact manifolds, results depend on the complexity of the manifold as measured by the second Betti number . For large Betti numbers in a simply connected 4-manifold, one can use a surgery along a knot or link to produce a new differential structure. With the help of this procedure one can produce countably infinite many differential structures. But even for simple spaces like one doesn't know the construction of other differential structures. For non-compact 4-manifolds there are many examples like having uncountably many differential structures.

																 In mathematics , the Stiefel manifold V k ( R n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames in R n . That is, it is the set of ordered k -tuples of orthonormal vectors in R n .

 [ edit ] Topology 
 Let F stand for R , C , or H . The Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) can be thought of as a set of n × k matrices by writing a k -frame as a matrix of k column vectors in F n . The orthonormality condition is expressed by A * A = 1 where A * denotes the conjugate transpose of A and 1 denotes the k × k identity matrix . We then have 
 
 
 
 The topology on V k ( F n ) is the subspace topology inherited from F n × k . With this topology V k ( F n ) is a compact manifold whose dimension is given by 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] As a homogeneous space 
 Each of the Stiefel manifolds V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space for the action of a classical group in a natural manner. 
 Every orthogonal transformation of a k -frame in R n results in another k -frame, and any two k -frames are related by some orthogonal transformation. In other words, the orthogonal group O( n ) acts transitively on V k ( R n ). The stabilizer subgroup of a given frame is the subgroup isomorphic to O( n − k ) which acts nontrivially on the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by that frame. 
 Likewise the unitary group U( n ) acts transitively on V k ( C n ) with stabilizer subgroup U( n − k ) and the symplectic group Sp( n ) acts transitively on V k ( H n ) with stabilizer subgroup Sp( n − k ). 
 In each case V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space: 
 
 
 
 When k = n , the corresponding action is free so that the Stiefel manifold V n ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding classical group. 
 When k is strictly less than n then the special orthogonal group SO( n ) also acts transitively on V k ( R n ) with stabilizer subgroup isomorphic to SO( n − k ) so that 
 
 
 
 The same holds for the action of the special unitary group on V k ( C n ) 
 
 
 
 Thus for k = n - 1, the Stiefel manifold is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding special classical group. 
 [ edit ] Special cases 
 
 
 k = 1 
 
 
 
 k = n −1 
 
 
 
 k = n 
 
 
 
 A 1-frame in F n is nothing but a unit vector, so the Stiefel manifold V 1 ( F n ) is just the unit sphere in F n . 
 Given a 2-frame in R n , let the first vector define a point in S n −1 and the second a unit tangent vector to the sphere at that point. In this way, the Stiefel manifold V 2 ( R n ) may be identified with the unit tangent bundle to S n −1 . 
 When k = n or n −1 we saw in the previous section that V k ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right. 
 
 [ edit ] Functoriality 
 Given an orthogonal inclusion between vector spaces the image of a set of k orthonormal vectors is orthonormal, so there is an induced closed inclusion of Stiefel manifolds, and this is functorial . More subtly, given an n -dimensional vector space X, the dual basis construction gives a bijection between bases for X and bases for the dual space X * , which is continuous, and thus yields a homeomorphism of top Stiefel manifolds This is also functorial for isomorphisms of vector spaces. 
 [ edit ] As a principal bundle 
 There is a natural projection 
 
 
 
 from the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) to the Grassmannian of k -planes in F n which sends a k -frame to the subspace spanned by that frame. The fiber over a given point P in G k ( F n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames contained in the space P . 
 This projection has the structure of a principal G -bundle where G is the associated classical group of degree k . Take the real case for concreteness. There is a natural right action of O( k ) on V k ( R n ) which rotates a k -frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive. The orbits of this action are precisely the orthonormal k -frames spanning a given k -dimensional subspace; that is, they are the fibers of the map p . Similar arguments hold in the complex and quaternionic cases. 
 We then have a sequence of principal bundles: 
 
 
 
 The vector bundles associated to these principal bundles via the natural action of G on F k are just the tautological bundles over the Grassmannians. In other words, the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) is the orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic frame bundle associated to the tautological bundle on a Grassmannian. 
 When one passes to the n → ∞ limit, these bundles become the universal bundles for the classical groups. 
 [ edit ] Homotopy 
 The Stiefel manifolds fit into a family of fibrations , thus the first non-trivial homotopy group of the space V k ( R n ) is in dimension n - k . Moreover, if n - k ∈ 2 Z or if k = 1. if n - k is odd and k &gt; 1. This result is used in the obstruction-theoretic definition of Stiefel-Whitney classes .

 k = 1 
 
 
 
 k = n −1 
 
 
 
 k = n 
 
 
 
 A 1-frame in F n is nothing but a unit vector, so the Stiefel manifold V 1 ( F n ) is just the unit sphere in F n . 
 Given a 2-frame in R n , let the first vector define a point in S n −1 and the second a unit tangent vector to the sphere at that point. In this way, the Stiefel manifold V 2 ( R n ) may be identified with the unit tangent bundle to S n −1 . 
 When k = n or n −1 we saw in the previous section that V k ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right. 
 
 [ edit ] Functoriality 
 Given an orthogonal inclusion between vector spaces the image of a set of k orthonormal vectors is orthonormal, so there is an induced closed inclusion of Stiefel manifolds, and this is functorial . More subtly, given an n -dimensional vector space X, the dual basis construction gives a bijection between bases for X and bases for the dual space X * , which is continuous, and thus yields a homeomorphism of top Stiefel manifolds This is also functorial for isomorphisms of vector spaces. 
 [ edit ] As a principal bundle 
 There is a natural projection 
 
 
 
 from the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) to the Grassmannian of k -planes in F n which sends a k -frame to the subspace spanned by that frame. The fiber over a given point P in G k ( F n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames contained in the space P . 
 This projection has the structure of a principal G -bundle where G is the associated classical group of degree k . Take the real case for concreteness. There is a natural right action of O( k ) on V k ( R n ) which rotates a k -frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive. The orbits of this action are precisely the orthonormal k -frames spanning a given k -dimensional subspace; that is, they are the fibers of the map p . Similar arguments hold in the complex and quaternionic cases. 
 We then have a sequence of principal bundles: 
 
 
 
 The vector bundles associated to these principal bundles via the natural action of G on F k are just the tautological bundles over the Grassmannians. In other words, the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) is the orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic frame bundle associated to the tautological bundle on a Grassmannian. 
 When one passes to the n → ∞ limit, these bundles become the universal bundles for the classical groups. 
 [ edit ] Homotopy 
 The Stiefel manifolds fit into a family of fibrations , thus the first non-trivial homotopy group of the space V k ( R n ) is in dimension n - k . Moreover, if n - k ∈ 2 Z or if k = 1. if n - k is odd and k &gt; 1. This result is used in the obstruction-theoretic definition of Stiefel-Whitney classes .

																 In mathematics , the Stiefel manifold V k ( R n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames in R n . That is, it is the set of ordered k -tuples of orthonormal vectors in R n . It is named after Swiss mathematician Eduard Stiefel . Likewise one can define the complex Stiefel manifold V k ( C n ) of orthonormal k -frames in C n and the quaternionic Stiefel manifold V k ( H n ) of orthonormal k -frames in H n . More generally, the construction applies to any real, complex, or quaternionic inner product space . 
 In some contexts, a non- compact Stiefel manifold is defined as the set of all linearly independent k -frames in R n , C n , or H n ; this is homotopy equivalent, as the compact Stiefel manifold is a deformation retract of the non-compact one, by Gram–Schmidt . Statements about the non-compact form correspond to those for the compact form, replacing the orthogonal group (or unitary or symplectic group) with the general linear group .

 [ edit ] Topology 
 Let F stand for R , C , or H . The Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) can be thought of as a set of n × k matrices by writing a k -frame as a matrix of k column vectors in F n . The orthonormality condition is expressed by A * A = 1 where A * denotes the conjugate transpose of A and 1 denotes the k × k identity matrix . We then have 
 
 
 
 The topology on V k ( F n ) is the subspace topology inherited from F n × k . With this topology V k ( F n ) is a compact manifold whose dimension is given by 
 
 
 
 
 
 [ edit ] As a homogeneous space 
 Each of the Stiefel manifolds V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space for the action of a classical group in a natural manner. 
 Every orthogonal transformation of a k -frame in R n results in another k -frame, and any two k -frames are related by some orthogonal transformation. In other words, the orthogonal group O( n ) acts transitively on V k ( R n ). The stabilizer subgroup of a given frame is the subgroup isomorphic to O( n − k ) which acts nontrivially on the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by that frame. 
 Likewise the unitary group U( n ) acts transitively on V k ( C n ) with stabilizer subgroup U( n − k ) and the symplectic group Sp( n ) acts transitively on V k ( H n ) with stabilizer subgroup Sp( n − k ). 
 In each case V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space: 
 
 
 
 When k = n , the corresponding action is free so that the Stiefel manifold V n ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding classical group. 
 When k is strictly less than n then the special orthogonal group SO( n ) also acts transitively on V k ( R n ) with stabilizer subgroup isomorphic to SO( n − k ) so that 
 
 
 
 The same holds for the action of the special unitary group on V k ( C n ) 
 
 
 
 Thus for k = n - 1, the Stiefel manifold is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding special classical group. 
 [ edit ] Special cases 
 
 
 k = 1 
 
 
 
 k = n −1 
 
 
 
 k = n 
 
 
 
 A 1-frame in F n is nothing but a unit vector, so the Stiefel manifold V 1 ( F n ) is just the unit sphere in F n . 
 Given a 2-frame in R n , let the first vector define a point in S n −1 and the second a unit tangent vector to the sphere at that point. In this way, the Stiefel manifold V 2 ( R n ) may be identified with the unit tangent bundle to S n −1 . 
 When k = n or n −1 we saw in the previous section that V k ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right.

 [ edit ] As a principal bundle 
 There is a natural projection 
 
 
 
 from the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) to the Grassmannian of k -planes in F n which sends a k -frame to the subspace spanned by that frame. The fiber over a given point P in G k ( F n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames contained in the space P . 
 This projection has the structure of a principal G -bundle where G is the associated classical group of degree k . Take the real case for concreteness. There is a natural right action of O( k ) on V k ( R n ) which rotates a k -frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive.

 The vector bundles associated to these principal bundles via the natural action of G on F k are just the tautological bundles over the Grassmannians. In other words, the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) is the orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic frame bundle associated to the tautological bundle on a Grassmannian. 
 When one passes to the n → ∞ limit, these bundles become the universal bundles for the classical groups.

 See also: Classification of manifolds#Point-set 
 In mathematics , a closed manifold is a type of topological space , namely a compact manifold without boundary. In contexts where no boundary is possible, any compact manifold is a closed manifold. 
 The simplest example is a circle , which is a compact one-dimensional manifold. Other examples of closed manifolds are the torus and the Klein bottle . As a counterexample, the real line is not a closed manifold because it is not compact. A disk is a compact two-dimensional manifold, but is not a closed manifold because it has a boundary. 
 Compact manifolds are, in an intuitive sense, "finite". By the basic properties of compactness, a closed manifold is the disjoint union of a finite number of connected closed manifolds. One of the most basic objectives of geometric topology is to understand what the supply of possible closed manifolds is. 
 All compact topological manifolds can be embedded into for some n , by the Whitney embedding theorem . 
 [ edit ] Contrasting terms 
 A compact manifold means a "manifold" that is compact as a topological space, but possibly has boundary. More precisely, it is a compact manifold with boundary (the boundary may be empty). By contrast, a closed manifold is compact without boundary. 
 An open manifold is a manifold without boundary with no compact component. For a connected manifold, "open" is equivalent to "without boundary and non-compact", but for a disconnected manifold, open is stronger. For instance, the disjoint union of a circle and the line is non-compact, but is not an open manifold, since one component (the circle) is compact. 
 The notion of closed manifold is unrelated with that of a closed set . A disk with its boundary is a closed set, but not a closed manifold. 
 [ edit ] Use in physics 
 The notion of a " closed universe " can refer to the universe being a closed manifold but more likely refers to the universe being a manifold of constant positive Ricci curvature .

 Two charts on a manifold 
 
 A transition map provides a way of comparing two charts of an atlas. To make this comparison, we consider the composition of one chart with the inverse of the other. This composition is not well-defined unless we restrict both charts to the intersection of their domains of definition. (For example, if we have a chart of Europe and a chart of Russia, then we can compare these two charts on their overlap, namely the European part of Russia.) 
 To be more precise, suppose that and are two charts for a manifold M such that is non-empty. The transition map is the map defined by 
 
 
 
 Note that since and are both homeomorphisms, the transition map is also a homeomorphism. 
 [ edit ] More structure 
 One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable . Such a manifold is called differentiable . Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives . 
 If each transition function is a smooth map , then the atlas is called a smooth atlas , and the manifold itself is called smooth . Alternatively, one could require that the transition maps have only k continuous derivatives in which case the atlas is said to be . 
 Very generally, if each transition function belongs to a pseudo-group of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space , then the atlas is called a -atlas.

 For other uses of "atlas", see Atlas (disambiguation) . 
 
 In mathematics , particularly topology , one describes a manifold using an atlas . An atlas consists of individual charts that, roughly speaking, describe individual regions of the manifold. If the manifold is the surface of the Earth, then an atlas has its more common meaning. In general, the notion of atlas underlies the formal definition of a manifold .

 [ edit ] Charts 
 The definition of an atlas depends on the notion of a chart . A chart for a topological space M is a homeomorphism from an open subset U &#160;of M to an open subset of Euclidean space . The chart is traditionally recorded as the ordered pair . 
 [ edit ] Formal definition of atlas 
 An atlas for a topological space M is a collection of charts on M such that . If the range of each chart is the n -dimensional Euclidean space , then M is said to be an n -dimensional manifold .

 Two charts on a manifold 
 
 A transition map provides a way of comparing two charts of an atlas. To make this comparison, we consider the composition of one chart with the inverse of the other. This composition is not well-defined unless we restrict both charts to the intersection of their domains of definition. (For example, if we have a chart of Europe and a chart of Russia, then we can compare these two charts on their overlap, namely the European part of Russia.) 
 To be more precise, suppose that and are two charts for a manifold M such that is non-empty. The transition map is the map defined by 
 
 
 
 Note that since and are both homeomorphisms, the transition map is also a homeomorphism. 
 [ edit ] More structure 
 One often desires more structure on a manifold than simply the topological structure. For example, if one would like an unambiguous notion of differentiation of functions on a manifold, then it is necessary to construct an atlas whose transition functions are differentiable . Such a manifold is called differentiable . Given a differentiable manifold, one can unambiguously define the notion of tangent vectors and then directional derivatives . 
 If each transition function is a smooth map , then the atlas is called a smooth atlas , and the manifold itself is called smooth . Alternatively, one could require that the transition maps have only k continuous derivatives in which case the atlas is said to be . 
 Very generally, if each transition function belongs to a pseudo-group of homeomorphisms of Euclidean space , then the atlas is called a -atlas.

																 In real algebraic geometry , a Nash function on an open semialgebraic subset U ⊂ R n is an analytic function f : U → R satisfying a nontrivial polynomial equation P ( x , f ( x )) = 0 for all x in U (A semialgebraic subset of R n is a subset obtained from subsets of the form { x in R n &#160;: P ( x )=0} or { x in R n &#160;: P ( x ) &gt; 0}, where P is a polynomial, by taking finite unions, finite intersections and complements).

 [ edit ] Nash manifolds 
 Along with Nash functions one defines Nash manifolds , which are semialgebraic analytic submanifolds of some R n . A Nash mapping between Nash manifolds is then an analytic mapping with semialgebraic graph. Nash functions and manifolds are named after John Forbes Nash, Jr. , who proved (1952) that any compact smooth manifold admits a Nash manifold structure, i.e., is diffeomorphic to some Nash manifold. More generally, a smooth manifold admits a Nash manifold structure if and only if it is diffeomorphic to the interior of some compact smooth manifold possibly with boundary. Nash's result was later (1973) completed by Alberto Tognoli who proved that any compact smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to some affine real algebraic manifold; actually, any Nash manifold is Nash diffeomorphic to an affine real algebraic manifold. These results exemplify the fact that the Nash category is somewhat intermediate between the smooth and the algebraic categories. 
 [ edit ] Local properties 
 The local properties of Nash functions are well understood. The ring of germs of Nash functions at a point of a Nash manifold of dimension n is isomorphic to the ring of algebraic power series in n variables (i.e., those series satisfying a nontrivial polynomial equation), which is the henselization of the ring of germs of rational functions. In particular, it is a regular local ring of dimension n . 
 [ edit ] Global properties 
 The global properties are more difficult to obtain. The fact that the ring of Nash functions on a Nash manifold (even noncompact) is noetherian was proved independently (1973) by Jean-Jacques Risler and Gustave Efroymson. Nash manifolds have properties similar to but weaker than Cartan's theorems A and B on Stein manifolds . Let denote the sheaf of Nash function germs on a Nash manifold M , and be a coherent sheaf of -ideals. Assume is finite, i.e., there exists a finite open semialgebraic covering of M such that, for each i , is generated by Nash functions on . Then is globally generated by Nash functions on M , and the natural map 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 is surjective. However 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 contrarily to the case of Stein manifolds. 
 [ edit ] Generalizations 
 Nash functions and manifolds can be defined over any real closed field instead of the field of real numbers, and the above statements still hold. Abstract Nash functions can also be defined on the real spectrum of any commutative ring.

A sphere , the most perfect spatial shape according to Pythagoreans , also is an important concept in modern understanding of Euclidean spaces 
 
 
 In mathematics , particularly in geometry , the concept of an Euclidean space encompasses Euclidean plane and the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry as spaces of dimensions 2 and 3 respectively. It is named after the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria . The term “Euclidean” distinguishes these spaces from other types of spaces considered in modern geometry . Euclidean spaces also generalizes these ideas to higher dimensions . 
 Classical Greek geometry defined the Euclidean plane and Euclidean three-dimensional space using certain postulates , while the other properties of these spaces were deduced as theorems . Geometric constructions also used to define rational numbers . When algebra and mathematical analysis became developed enough, this relation reversed and now it is more common to define Euclidean space using Cartesian coordinates and the ideas of analytic geometry . It means that points of the space are specified with collections of real numbers and geometric shapes are defined as equations and inequalities . This approach brings the tools of algebra and calculus to bear on questions of geometry, and has the advantage that it generalizes easily to Euclidean spaces of more than three dimensions. 
 From the modern viewpoint, there is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension. With Cartesian coordinates it is modelled by the real coordinate space &#160;( R n ) of the same dimension. In dimension one this is the real line ; in dimension two it is the Cartesian plane ; and in higher dimensions it is a coordinate space with three or more real number coordinates. Mathematicians denote the n -dimensional Euclidean space by E n if they wish to emphasize its Euclidean nature, but R n is used as well, since the latter assumed to have the standard Eucludean structure and these two structures are not always distinguished. Euclidean spaces have finite dimension. [ citation needed ] 
 
 
 
  
Every point in three-dimensional Euclidean space is determined by three coordinates.

 [ edit ] Intuitive overview 
 One way to think of the Euclidean plane is as a set of points satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as symmetries ) on the plane. One is translation , which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets ) of the plane should be considered equivalent ( congruent ) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections (see below ). 
 In order to make all of this mathematically precise , the theory must clearly define the notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation for a mathematically described space. Even when used in physical theories, Euclidean space is an abstraction detached from actual physical locations, specific reference frames , measurement instruments, and so. A purely mathematical definition of Euclidean space ignores also questions of units of length and other physical dimensions : the distance in a "mathematical" space is a number , not something expressed in inches or metres. The standard way to define such space, as carried out in the remainder of this article, is to define the Euclidean plane as a two-dimensional real vector space equipped with an inner product . The reason for working with arbitrary vector spaces instead of R n is that it is often preferable to work in a coordinate-free manner (that is, without choosing a preferred basis). For then: 
 
 the vectors in the vector space correspond to the points of the Euclidean plane, 
 the addition operation in the vector space corresponds to translation, and 
 the inner product implies notions of angle and distance, which can be used to define rotation. 
 
 Once the Euclidean plane has been described in this language, it is actually a simple matter to extend its concept to arbitrary dimensions. For the most part, the vocabulary, formulae, and calculations are not made any more difficult by the presence of more dimensions. (However, rotations are more subtle in high dimensions, and visualizing high-dimensional spaces remains difficult, even for experienced mathematicians.) 
 An Euclidean space is not technically a vector space but rather an affine space , on which a vector space acts by translations , or, conversely, an Euclidean vector is the difference (displacement) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says merely that there is no canonical choice of where the origin should go in the space, because it can be translated anywhere. When certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as said above. See point–vector distinction for details. 
 [ edit ] Euclidean structure 
 These are distances between points and the angles between lines or vectors, which satisfy certain conditions (see below ), which makes a set of points an Euclidean space. The natural way to obtain these quantities is by introducing and using the standard inner product (also known as the dot product ) on&#160; R n . The inner product of any two real n -vectors x and y is defined by 
 
 
 
 where x i and y i are i th coordinates of vectors x and y respectively. The result is always a real number. 
 [ edit ] Distance 
 Main article: Euclidean distance 
 The inner product of x with itself is always non-negative . This product allows us to define the "length" of a vector&#160; x through square root : 
 
 
 
 This length function satisfies the required properties of a norm and is called the Euclidean norm on&#160; R n . 
 Finally, one can use the norm to define a metric (or distance function) on&#160; R n by 
 
 
 
 This distance function is called the Euclidean metric . This formula expresses a special case of the Pythagorean theorem . 
 This distance function (which makes a metric space ) is sufficient to define all Euclidean geometry, including the dot product. Thus, a real coordinate space together with this Euclidean structure is called Euclidean space . Its vectors form an inner product space (in fact a Hilbert space ), and a normed vector space . 
 The metric space structure is the main reason behind the use of real numbers &#160; R , not some other ordered field , as the mathematical foundation of Euclidean (and many other) spaces. Euclidean space is a complete metric space , a property which is impossible to achieve operating over rational numbers , for example. 
 [ edit ] Angle 
 Main article: Angle 
 
 
 
  
Positive and negative angles on the oriented plane 
 
 
 The (non-reflex) angle &#160; θ ( 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° ) between vectors x and y is then given by 
 
 
 
 where arccos is the arccosine function. It it useful only for n &gt; 1 , [ 1 ] and the case n = 2 is somewhat special. Namely, on an oriented Euclidean plane one can define an angle between two vectors as a number defined modulo &#160; 1&#160;turn (usually denoted as either 2 π or 360°), such that ∠ y   x = −∠ x   y . This oriented angle equals either to the angle&#160; θ from the formula above or to&#160; − θ . If one non-zero vector is fixed (such as the first basis vector), then each non-zero vector is uniquely defined by its magnitude and angle. 
 The angle does not change if vectors x and y are multiplied to positive numbers . 
 Unlike the aforementioned situation with distance, the scale of angles is the same in pure mathematics, physics, and computing. It does not depend on the scale of distances: all distances may be multiplied to some fixed positive factor, while all angles preserve. Usually the angle is considered as a dimensionless quantity , but there are different units of measurement, such as radian (preferred in pure mathematics and theoretical physics) and degree &#160;° (preferred in most applications).

 [ edit ] Rotations and reflections 
 Main articles: Rotation (mathematics) , Reflection (mathematics) , and Orthogonal group 
 See also: rotational symmetry &#160;and reflection symmetry 
 Symmetries of an Euclidean space are transformations which preserves the Euclidean metric (called isometries ). Although aforementioned translations are most obvious of them, they have the same structure for any affine space and do not show a distinctive character of Euclidean geometry. Another family of symmetries leave one point fixed, which may be seen as the origin without loss of generality. All transformations, which preserves the origin and the Euclidean metric, are linear. Such transformations&#160; Q must, for any x and y , satisfy: 
 
  ( explain the notation ), 
 
 
 Such transforms constitute a group called the orthogonal group &#160; O( n ) . Its elements&#160; Q are exactly solutions of a matrix equation 
 
 
 
 where Q T is the transpose of&#160; Q and I is the identity matrix . 
 But an Euclidean space is orientable . [ 2 ] Each of these transformations either preserves or reverses orientation depending on whether its determinant is +1 or −1 respectively. Only transformations which preserve orientation, which form the special orthogonal group&#160; SO( n ) , are considered (proper) rotations . This group has, as a Lie group , the same dimension&#160; n ( n − 1)/2 and is the connected component of identity of&#160; O( n ) .

 Groups&#160; SO( n ) are well-studied for&#160; n ≤ 4 . There are no non-trivial rotations in 0- and 1-spaces. Rotations of an Euclidean plane ( n = 2 ) are parametrized by the angle (modulo 1&#160;turn) . Rotations of a 3-space are parametrized with angle and axis , whereas a rotation of a 4-space is a superposition of two 2-dimensional rotations around perpendicular planes. 
 Among linear isometries which reverse the orientation are hyperplane reflections . This is the only possible case for&#160; n ≤ 2 , but starting from 3&#160;dimensions such isometry in the general position is a rotoreflection . 
 [ edit ] Euclidean group 
 Main article: Euclidean group 
 Euclidean group ( E ( n ) , sometimes called ISO( n ) ) treats translations, rotations, and reflections in an uniform way, considering them as group actions in the context of group theory and, especially, Lie group theory. The group of all isometries , where any of these preserves the Euclidean structure, is important because it makes Euclidean geometry a case of Klein geometry , a theoretical framework including many alternative geometries . Aforementioned structure of an Euclidean space: distances, lines, vectors, angles ( up to sign), and so on, is invariant to any of transforms from appropriate Euclidean group . Translation form a commutative subgroup which acts freely and transitively , while the stabilizer of any point is the aforementioned O( n ) . 
 This structure of Euclidean group essentially explains to which conditions should a metric space satisfy to be an Euclidean space. First, it must be translationally -invariant with respect to some (finite-dimensional) real vector space, which means that the space itself is an affine space . One may understand it as that the space is flat , not curved , and points do not have different properties because any point can be translated to any another point. Second, the metric must correspond in the aforementioned way to some positive-defined quadratic form on this vector space, because point stabilizers have to be isomorphic to&#160; O( n ) .

 Cartesian coordinates are arguably the standard, but not the only possible option for an Euclidean space. Skew coordinates are compatible with the affine structure of&#160; E n , but make formulae for angles and distances more complicated.

 Another approach, which goes in line with ideas of differential geometry and conformal geometry , is orthogonal coordinates , where coordinate hypersurfaces of different coordinates are orthogonal , although curved .

 Main article: Flat (geometry) 
 Simplest (after points) objects in Euclidean space are flats , or Euclidean subspaces of lesser dimension. Points are 0-dimensional flats, 1-dimensional flats are called (straight) lines and 2-dimensional flats are planes . ( n' − 1) -dimensional flats are called hyperplanes . 
 Any two distinct point lie on exactly one line. Any line and a point outside it lie on exactly one plane. These properties are studied by affine geometry , which is more general that Euclidean one, and can be generalized to higher dimensions. 
 [ edit ] Line segments and triangles 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 The sum of angles of a triangle is an important problem, which exerted a great influence to 19th-century mathematics. In an Euclidean space it invariably equals to 180 ° , or a half-turn 
 
 
 
 Main articles: Line segment and Triangle geometry 
 This is not only a line which a pair&#160; ( A ,  B ) of distinct points defines. Point of the line which lie between A and B , together with A and B themselves, constitute a line segment &#160; A   B . Any line segment has the length , which equals to distance between A and B . If A = B , then the segment is degenerate and its length equals to&#160;0, otherwise the length is positive. 
 A (non-degenerate) triangle is defined by three points not lying on the same line. Any triangle lies on one plane. The concept of triangle is not specific to Euclidean spaces, but Euclidean triangles have numerous special properties and define many derived objects. 
 A triangle can be thought of as a 3-gon on a plane, a special (and the first meaningful in Euclidean geometry) case of a polygon .

 See also: List of polygons, polyhedra and polytopes &#160;and List of regular polytopes 
 Polytope is a concept which generalizes polygons on a plane and polyhedra in 3-dimensional space (which are among the earliest studied geometrical objects). A simplex is a generalization of a line segment (1-simplex) and a triangle (2-simplex). A tetrahedron is a 3-simplex. 
 The concept of a polytope belongs to affine geometry , which is more general than Euclidean. But Euclidean geometry distinguish regular polytopes . For example, affine geometry does not see the difference between an equilateral triangle and a right triangle , but in Euclidean space the former is regular and the latter is not. 
 Root systems are special sets of Euclidean vectors. A root system is often identical to the set of vertices of a regular polytope.

 [ edit ] Topology 
 Main article: Real coordinate space #Topological properties 
 Since Euclidean space is a metric space , it is also a topological space with the natural topology induced by the metric. The metric topology on E n is called the Euclidean topology , and it is identical to the standard topology on&#160; R n . A set is open if and only if it contains an open ball around each of its points; in other words, open balls form a base of the topology. The topological dimension of the Euclidean n -space equals to n , which implies that spaces of different dimension are not homeomorphic . A finer result is the invariance of domain , which proves that any subset of&#160; n -space, that is (with its subspace topology ) homeomorphic to an open subset of&#160; n -space, is itself open. 
 [ edit ] Alternatives and generalizations 
 Although Euclidean spaces are not considered as the only possible setting for a geometry any more, they form the prototypes for other, more complicated geometric objects. Ideas and terminology from Euclidean geometry (both traditional and analytic) are pervasive in modern mathematics, where other geometric objects share many similarities with Euclidean spaces, have a portion of their structure, or include Euclidean spaces as a partial case. 
 [ edit ] Curved spaces 
 Main article: Riemannian geometry 
 A smooth manifold is a Hausdorff topological space that is locally diffeomorphic to Euclidean space. Diffeomorphism does not respect distance and angle, but if one additionally prescribes a smoothly varying inner product on the manifold's tangent spaces , then the result is what is called a Riemannian manifold . Put differently, a Riemannian manifold is a space constructed by deforming and patching together Euclidean spaces. Such a space enjoys notions of distance and angle, but they behave in a curved , non-Euclidean manner. The simplest Riemannian manifold, consisting of R n with a constant inner product, is essentially identical to Euclidean n -space itself. Less trivial examples are n -sphere and hyperbolic spaces . Discovery of the latter in 19th&#160;century was branded as the non-Euclidean geometry . 
 Also, the concept of a Riemannian manifold permits an expression of the Euclidean structure in any smooth coordinate system , via metric tensor . From this tensor one can compute the Riemann curvature tensor . Where the latter equals to zero, the metric structure is locally Euclidean (it means that at least some open set in the coordinate space is isometric to a piece of Euclidean space), no matter whether coordinates are affine of curvilinear. 
 [ edit ] Indefinite metric form 
 See also: Sylvester's law of inertia 
 If one alters a Euclidean space so that its inner product becomes negative in one or more directions, then the result is a pseudo-Euclidean space . Smooth manifolds built from such spaces are called pseudo-Riemannian manifolds . Perhaps their most famous application is the theory of relativity , where empty spacetime with no matter is represented by the flat pseudo-Euclidean space called Minkowski space , spacetimes with matter in them form other pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, and gravity corresponds to the curvature of such a manifold. 
 Our universe, being subject to relativity, is not Euclidean. [ clarification needed ] This becomes significant in theoretical considerations of astronomy and cosmology , and also in some practical problems such as global positioning and airplane navigation . Nonetheless, a Euclidean model of the universe can still be used to solve many other practical problems with sufficient precision. 
 [ edit ] Other number fields 
 Another line of generalization is to consider other number fields than one of real numbers. Over complex numbers , a Hilbert space can be seen as a generalization of Euclidean dot product structure, although the definition of the inner product relies on a more complicated structure, named a sesquilinear form , for compatibility with metric structure.

 [ edit ] Footnotes 
 
 
 ^  On real line ( n = 1 ) any two non-zero vectors are either parallel or antiparallel depending on whether their signs match or oppose. There are no angles between 0 and 180°. 
 ^  It is R n which is orient ed because of the ordering of elements of the standard basis . Although an orientation is not an attribute of the Euclidean structure, there are only two possible orientations , and any linear automorphism either keeps orientation or reverses (swaps the two).

 [ edit ] Description 
 Differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined. Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold—that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume. 
 On the other hand, smooth manifolds are more rigid than the topological manifolds . John Milnor discovered that some spheres have more than one smooth structure—see exotic sphere and Donaldson's theorem . Kervaire exhibited topological manifolds with no smooth structure at all. [ 1 ] Some constructions of smooth manifold theory, such as the existence of tangent bundles, [ 2 ] can be done in the topological setting with much more work, and others cannot. 
 One of the main topics in differential topology is the study of special kinds of smooth mappings between manifolds, namely immersions and submersions , and the intersections of submanifolds via transversality . More generally one is interested in properties and invariants of smooth manifolds which are carried over by diffeomorphisms , another special kind of smooth mapping. Morse theory is another branch of differential topology, in which topological information about a manifold is deduced from changes in the rank of the Jacobian of a function. 
 For a list of differential topology topics, see the following reference: List of differential geometry topics . 
 [ edit ] Differential topology versus differential geometry 
 For more details on this topic, see geometry and topology . 
 Differential topology and differential geometry are first characterized by their similarity . They both study primarily the properties of differentiable manifolds, sometimes with a variety of structures imposed on them. 
 One major difference lies in the nature of the problems that each subject tries to address. In one view, [ 3 ] differential topology distinguishes itself from differential geometry by studying primarily those problems which are inherently global . Consider the example of a coffee cup and a donut (see this example ). From the point of view of differential topology, the donut and the coffee cup are the same (in a sense). This is an inherently global view, though, because there is no way for the differential topologist to tell whether the two objects are the same (in this sense) by looking at just a tiny ( local ) piece of either of them. He or she must have access to each entire ( global ) object. 
 From the point of view of differential geometry, the coffee cup and the donut are different because it is impossible to rotate the coffee cup in such a way that its configuration matches that of the donut. This is also a global way of thinking about the problem. But an important distinction is that the geometer does not need the entire object to decide this. By looking, for instance, at just a tiny piece of the handle, he can decide that the coffee cup is different from the donut because the handle is thinner (or more curved) than any piece of the donut. 
 To put it succinctly, differential topology studies structures on manifolds which, in a sense, have no interesting local structure. Differential geometry studies structures on manifolds which do have an interesting local (or sometimes even infinitesimal) structure. 
 More mathematically, for example, the problem of constructing a diffeomorphism between two manifolds of the same dimension is inherently global since locally two such manifolds are always diffeomorphic. Likewise, the problem of computing a quantity on a manifold which is invariant under differentiable mappings is inherently global, since any local invariant will be trivial in the sense that it is already exhibited in the topology of R n . Moreover, differential topology does not restrict itself necessarily to the study of diffeomorphism. For example, symplectic topology — a subbranch of differential topology — studies global properties of symplectic manifolds . Differential geometry concerns itself with problems — which may be local or global — that always have some non-trivial local properties. Thus differential geometry may study differentiable manifolds equipped with a connection , a metric (which may be Riemannian , pseudo-Riemannian , or Finsler ), a special sort of distribution (such as a CR structure ), and so on. 
 This distinction between differential geometry and differential topology is blurred, however, in questions specifically pertaining to local diffeomorphism invariants such as the tangent space at a point. Differential topology also deals with questions like these, which specifically pertain to the properties of differentiable mappings on R n (for example the tangent bundle , jet bundles , the Whitney extension theorem , and so forth). 
 Nevertheless, the distinction becomes clearer in abstract terms. Differential topology is the study of the (infinitesimal, local, and global) properties of structures on manifolds having no non-trivial local moduli , whereas differential geometry is the study of the (infinitesimal, local, and global) properties of structures on manifolds having non-trivial local moduli.

 [ edit ] Description 
 Differential topology considers the properties and structures that require only a smooth structure on a manifold to be defined. Smooth manifolds are 'softer' than manifolds with extra geometric structures, which can act as obstructions to certain types of equivalences and deformations that exist in differential topology. For instance, volume and Riemannian curvature are invariants that can distinguish different geometric structures on the same smooth manifold—that is, one can smoothly "flatten out" certain manifolds, but it might require distorting the space and affecting the curvature or volume. 
 On the other hand, smooth manifolds are more rigid than the topological manifolds . John Milnor discovered that some spheres have more than one smooth structure—see exotic sphere and Donaldson's theorem . Kervaire exhibited topological manifolds with no smooth structure at all. [ 1 ] Some constructions of smooth manifold theory, such as the existence of tangent bundles, [ 2 ] can be done in the topological setting with much more work, and others cannot. 
 One of the main topics in differential topology is the study of special kinds of smooth mappings between manifolds, namely immersions and submersions , and the intersections of submanifolds via transversality . More generally one is interested in properties and invariants of smooth manifolds which are carried over by diffeomorphisms , another special kind of smooth mapping. Morse theory is another branch of differential topology, in which topological information about a manifold is deduced from changes in the rank of the Jacobian of a function. 
 For a list of differential topology topics, see the following reference: List of differential geometry topics . 
 [ edit ] Differential topology versus differential geometry 
 For more details on this topic, see geometry and topology . 
 Differential topology and differential geometry are first characterized by their similarity . They both study primarily the properties of differentiable manifolds, sometimes with a variety of structures imposed on them. 
 One major difference lies in the nature of the problems that each subject tries to address. In one view, [ 3 ] differential topology distinguishes itself from differential geometry by studying primarily those problems which are inherently global . Consider the example of a coffee cup and a donut (see this example ). From the point of view of differential topology, the donut and the coffee cup are the same (in a sense). This is an inherently global view, though, because there is no way for the differential topologist to tell whether the two objects are the same (in this sense) by looking at just a tiny ( local ) piece of either of them. He or she must have access to each entire ( global ) object. 
 From the point of view of differential geometry, the coffee cup and the donut are different because it is impossible to rotate the coffee cup in such a way that its configuration matches that of the donut. This is also a global way of thinking about the problem. But an important distinction is that the geometer does not need the entire object to decide this. By looking, for instance, at just a tiny piece of the handle, he can decide that the coffee cup is different from the donut because the handle is thinner (or more curved) than any piece of the donut. 
 To put it succinctly, differential topology studies structures on manifolds which, in a sense, have no interesting local structure. Differential geometry studies structures on manifolds which do have an interesting local (or sometimes even infinitesimal) structure. 
 More mathematically, for example, the problem of constructing a diffeomorphism between two manifolds of the same dimension is inherently global since locally two such manifolds are always diffeomorphic. Likewise, the problem of computing a quantity on a manifold which is invariant under differentiable mappings is inherently global, since any local invariant will be trivial in the sense that it is already exhibited in the topology of R n . Moreover, differential topology does not restrict itself necessarily to the study of diffeomorphism. For example, symplectic topology — a subbranch of differential topology — studies global properties of symplectic manifolds . Differential geometry concerns itself with problems — which may be local or global — that always have some non-trivial local properties. Thus differential geometry may study differentiable manifolds equipped with a connection , a metric (which may be Riemannian , pseudo-Riemannian , or Finsler ), a special sort of distribution (such as a CR structure ), and so on. 
 This distinction between differential geometry and differential topology is blurred, however, in questions specifically pertaining to local diffeomorphism invariants such as the tangent space at a point. Differential topology also deals with questions like these, which specifically pertain to the properties of differentiable mappings on R n (for example the tangent bundle , jet bundles , the Whitney extension theorem , and so forth). 
 Nevertheless, the distinction becomes clearer in abstract terms. Differential topology is the study of the (infinitesimal, local, and global) properties of structures on manifolds having no non-trivial local moduli , whereas differential geometry is the study of the (infinitesimal, local, and global) properties of structures on manifolds having non-trivial local moduli.

 Title: 
Boundary behaviour of harmonic functions on hyperbolic manifolds 
 Authors: 
 Camille Petit 
 (Submitted on 24 Feb 2013) 
 
 Abstract: Let $M$ be a complete simply connected manifold which is in addition Gromov
hyperbolic, coercive and roughly starlike. For a given harmonic function on
$M$, a local Fatou Theorem and a pointwise criteria of non-tangential
convergence coming from the density of energy are shown: at almost all points
of the boundary, the harmonic function converges non-tangentially if and only
if the supremum of the density of energy is finite. As an application of these
results, a Calder\'on-Stein Theorem is proved, that is, the non-tangential
properties of convergence, boundedness and finiteness of energy are equivalent
at almost every point of the boundary.

From left to right, the square , the cube , and the tesseract . The square is bounded by 1-dimensional lines, the cube by 2-dimensional areas, and the tesseract by 3-dimensional volumes. A projection of the cube is given since it is viewed on a two-dimensional screen. The same applies to the tesseract, which additionally can only be shown as a projection even in three-dimensional space.

 In physics and mathematics , the dimension of a space or object is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] Thus a line has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it (for example, the point at 5 on a number line). A surface such as a plane or the surface of a cylinder or sphere has a dimension of two because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it (for example, to locate a point on the surface of a sphere you need both its latitude and its longitude ). The inside of a cube , a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. 
 In physical terms, dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space ( cf. volume ) and its position in time (perceived as a scalar dimension along the t -axis), as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that correlate with both particle and field conceptions, interact according to relative properties of mass —and are fundamentally mathematical in description. These, or other axes, may be referenced to uniquely identify a point or structure in its attitude and relationship to other objects and occurrences. Physical theories that incorporate time , such as general relativity , are said to work in 4-dimensional " spacetime ", (defined as a Minkowski space ). Modern theories tend to be "higher-dimensional" including quantum field and string theories. The state-space of quantum mechanics is an infinite-dimensional function space . 
 The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. High-dimensional spaces occur in mathematics and the sciences for many reasons, frequently as configuration spaces such as in Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics ; these are abstract spaces, independent of the physical space we live in.

 [ edit ] In mathematics 
 In mathematics, the dimension of an object is an intrinsic property independent of the space in which the object is embedded. For example, a point on the unit circle in the plane can be specified by two Cartesian coordinates , but one can make do with a single coordinate (the polar coordinate angle), so the circle is 1-dimensional even though it exists in the 2-dimensional plane. This intrinsic notion of dimension is one of the chief ways the mathematical notion of dimension differs from its common usages. 
 The dimension of Euclidean n -space E n is n . When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes E n  n -dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed ball in E n by small balls of radius ε , one needs on the order of ε - n such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the Minkowski dimension and its more sophisticated variant, the Hausdorff dimension , but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in E n looks locally like E n -1 and this leads to the notion of the inductive dimension . While these notions agree on E n , they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces. 
 A tesseract is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside of mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract has four dimensions ", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract has dimension 4 ", or: "The dimension of the tesseract is 4". 
 Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to René Descartes , substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of Arthur Cayley , William Rowan Hamilton , Ludwig Schläfli and Bernhard Riemann . Riemann's 1854 Habilitationsschrift , Schlafi's 1852 Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität , Hamilton's 1843 discovery of the quaternions and the construction of the Cayley Algebra marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry. 
 The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of the dimensions. 
 [ edit ] Dimension of a vector space 
 Main article: Dimension (vector space) 
 The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the cardinality of a basis) is often referred to as the Hamel dimension or algebraic dimension to distinguish it from other notions of dimension. 
 [ edit ] Manifolds 
 A connected topological manifold is locally homeomorphic to Euclidean n -space, and the number n is called the manifold's dimension. One can show that this yields a uniquely defined dimension for every connected topological manifold. 
 For connected differentiable manifolds the dimension is also the dimension of the tangent vector space at any point 
 The theory of manifolds, in the field of geometric topology , is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the high-dimensional cases n &gt; 4 are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases n = 3 and 4 are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the Poincaré conjecture , where four different proof methods are applied. 
 [ edit ] Varieties 
 Main article: Dimension of an algebraic variety 
 The dimension of an algebraic variety may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the tangent space at any regular point . Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of hyperplanes that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety. 
 An algebraic set being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains of sub varieties of the given variety (the length of such a chain is the number of " "). 
 [ edit ] Krull dimension 
 Main article: Krull dimension 
 The Krull dimension of a commutative ring is the maximal length of prime ideals in it. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of a natural correspondence between sub varieties and prime ideals of ring of the polynomials on the variety. 
 For an algebra over a field , the dimension as vector space is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0. 
 [ edit ] Lebesgue covering dimension 
 Main article: Lebesgue covering dimension 
 For any normal topological space X , the Lebesgue covering dimension of X is defined to be n if n is the smallest integer for which the following holds: any open cover has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than n + 1 elements. In this case dim X = n . For X a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer n exists, then the dimension of X is said to be infinite, and one writes dim X = ∞ . Moreover, X has dimension −1, i.e. dim X = −1 if and only if X is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all Tychonoff spaces merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term " functionally open ". 
 [ edit ] Inductive dimension 
 Main article: Inductive dimension 
 An inductive definition of dimension can be created as follows. Consider a discrete set of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a new direction , one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ( n + 1 )-dimensional object by dragging an n dimensional object in a new direction. 
 The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the small inductive dimension or the large inductive dimension , and is based on the analogy that ( n + 1 )-dimensional balls have n dimensional boundaries , permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets. 
 [ edit ] Hausdorff dimension 
 Main article: Hausdorff dimension 
 For structurally complicated sets, especially fractals , the Hausdorff dimension is useful. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all metric spaces and, unlike the Hamel dimension, can also attain non-integer real values. [ 3 ] The box dimension or Minkowski dimension is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of fractal dimensions that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena. [ 4 ]  [ 5 ] 
 [ edit ] Hilbert spaces 
 Every Hilbert space admits an orthonormal basis , and any two such bases for a particular space have the same cardinality . This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's Hamel dimension is finite, and in this case the above dimensions coincide. 
 [ edit ] In physics 
 [ edit ] Spatial dimensions 
 Classical physics theories describe three physical dimensions: from a particular point in space , the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; i.e. , moving in a linear combination of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See Space and Cartesian coordinate system .)

 [ edit ] Time 
 A temporal dimension is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the " fourth dimension " for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move in one direction . 
 The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of classical mechanics are symmetric with respect to time , and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as charge and parity ) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the laws of thermodynamics (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing entropy ). 
 The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is Poincaré and Einstein 's special relativity (and extended to general relativity ), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional manifold , known as spacetime , and in the special, flat case as Minkowski space . 
 [ edit ] Additional dimensions 
 In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. There are theories that try to unify different forces and such—these theories require more dimensions. Superstring theory , M-theory and Bosonic string theory respectively posit that physical space has 10, 11 and 26 dimensions. These extra dimensions are said to be spatial. However, we perceive only three spatial dimensions and, to date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to confirm the existence of these extra dimensions. A possible explanation that has been suggested is that space acts as if it were "curled up" in the extra dimensions on a subatomic scale, possibly at the quark/string level of scale or below. 
 An analysis of results from the Large Hadron Collider in December 2010 severely constrains theories with large extra dimensions . [ 6 ] 
 Other physical theories that have introduced extra dimensions of space are: 
 
 Kaluza–Klein theory introduces extra dimensions to explain the fundamental forces other than gravity (originally only electromagnetism ). 
 Large extra dimension and the Randall–Sundrum model attempt to explain the weakness of gravity. This is also a feature of brane cosmology. 
 Universal extra dimension 
 
 [ edit ] Networks and dimension 
 Some complex networks are characterized by fractal dimensions. [ 7 ] The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space. [ 8 ] The dimension characterize their spatial constraints. 
 [ edit ] Literature 
 Main article: Fourth dimension in literature 
 Perhaps the most basic way the word dimension is used in literature is as a hyperbolic synonym for feature , attribute , aspect , or magnitude . Frequently the hyperbole is quite literal as in he's so 2-dimensional , meaning that one can see at a glance what he is . This contrasts with 3-dimensional objects, which have an interior that is hidden from view, and a back that can only be seen with further examination. 
 Science fiction texts often mention the concept of dimension, when really referring to parallel universes , alternate universes, or other planes of existence . This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones. 
 One of the most heralded science fiction novellas regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novel Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described Flatland as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions." 
 The idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in Miles J. Breuer 's The Appendix and the Spectacles (1928) and Murray Leinster 's The Fifth-Dimension Catapult (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s. Classic stories involving other dimensions include Robert A. Heinlein 's —And He Built a Crooked House (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract, and Alan E. Nourse 's Tiger by the Tail and The Universe Between (both 1951). Another reference is Madeleine L'Engle 's novel A Wrinkle In Time (1962), which uses the 5th dimension as a way for "tesseracting the universe" or in a better sense, "folding" space to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book The Boy Who Reversed Himself , by William Sleator . 
 [ edit ] Philosophy 
 In 1783, Kant wrote: "That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition a priori because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain." [ 9 ] 
 Space has Four Dimensions , is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and experimental psychologist Gustav Fechner (under the pseudonym Dr. Mises). The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of, and able to communicate with, other shadows; but is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, the shadow-man would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time. [ 10 ] The story bears a strong similarity to the " Allegory of the Cave ", presented in Plato 's The Republic written around 380 B.C. 
 Simon Newcomb wrote an article for the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society in 1898 entitled "The Philosophy of Hyperspace". [ 11 ] Linda Dalrymple Henderson coined the term Hyperspace philosophy in her 1983 thesis about the fourth dimension in early-twentieth-century art. It is used to describe those writers that use higher-dimensions for metaphysical and philosophical exploration. [ 12 ]  Charles Howard Hinton (who was the first to use the word " tesseract " in 1888) and Russian esotericist P. D. Ouspensky are examples of "hyperspace philosophers".
