They began playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1970 as an expansion team. They play their home games at Quicken Loans Arena . \n The Cavaliers have featured many NBA stars during its history, including draft picks turned All-Stars Austin Carr , Brad Daugherty , Zydrunas Ilgauskas , Mark Price , LeBron James , and Kyrie Irving . Past NBA greats such as Nate Thurmond , Walt "Clyde" Frazier , and Shaquille O\'Neal also played in Cleveland (albeit near the end of their careers). \n The team has had moderate success in its history, winning three Central Division Championships (1976, 2009, 2010), an Eastern Conference Championship in 2007, and 18 total playoff seasons. However, the team has also had a number of dubious distinctions, such as former owner Ted Stepien \'s tenure, which led the NBA to create a rule regulating the trading of draft picks ("The Stepien Rule"), and a 26 game losing streak in 2010\xe2\x80\x9311, which tied the record for the longest losing streak in major American professional sports. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Franchise history \n \n 1.1 Team Creation \n 1.2 1970\xe2\x80\x931980: Expansion \n 1.3 1980\xe2\x80\x931983: Ownership under Ted Stepien \n 1.4 1983-1986: The Gunds Take Over \n 1.5 1986\xe2\x80\x931992: One of the NBA\'s Best Teams \n 1.6 1993\xe2\x80\x932003: A decade of struggle \n 1.7 2003\xe2\x80\x932010: The LeBron James Era \n 1.8 2010\xe2\x80\x932011: Struggles and Infamy \n 1.9 2011\xe2\x80\x93present: Rebuilding with Kyrie Irving \n \n \n 2 Season-by-season records \n 3 Logos and uniforms \n \n 3.1 The "original" wine and gold \n 3.2 The orange and blue \n 3.3 The orange, blue, and black \n 3.4 The "new" wine and gold \n 3.5 The return to "old school" wine and gold \n 3.6 Special uniforms \n \n \n 4 Home arenas \n 5 Cleveland Clinic Courts \n 6 Players of note \n \n 6.1 Current roster \n 6.2 International rights \n 6.3 Retired numbers \n 6.4 Ground-breaking players \n 6.5 Basketball Hall of Famers \n \n \n 7 Coaches and others \n \n 7.1 Coaches \n \n \n 8 High points \n \n 8.1 Franchise leaders \n \n 8.1.1 Career \n 8.1.2 Per game \n 8.1.3 Per 48 minutes \n \n \n 8.2 Individual awards \n 8.3 NBA All-Star Weekend \n \n \n 9 Radio and TV \n 10 Mascots \n \n 10.1 Past \n \n 10.1.1 Whammer \n \n \n 10.2 Current \n \n 10.2.1 Moondog \n 10.2.2 Sir C.C. \n \n \n \n \n 11 References \n 12 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Franchise history \n [ edit ] Team Creation \n The Cavaliers first began play in the NBA in 1970 as an expansion team under the ownership of Nick Mileti . The father of Major League Baseball pitcher Brett Tomko , Jerry Tomko, submitted the winning entry to name the team the "Cavaliers" through a competition sponsored by the The Plain Dealer , supporters preferred it to "Jays", "Foresters" and "Presidents". [ 1 ] Playing their home games at Cleveland Arena under the direction of head coach Bill Fitch , they compiled a league-worst 15\xe2\x80\x9367 record in their inaugural season. The team hoped to build around the number one 1971 draft pick Austin Carr who had set numerous scoring records at Notre Dame , but Carr severely injured his leg shortly into his pro career and never was able to realize his potential. \n [ edit ] 1970\xe2\x80\x931980: Expansion \n The following seasons saw the Cavaliers gradually improve their on-court performance, thanks to season-by-season additions of talented players such as Bingo Smith , Jim Chones , Jim Cleamons and Dick Snyder . Cleveland improved to 23\xe2\x80\x9359 in their sophomore season , followed by a 32\xe2\x80\x9350 record in 1972\xe2\x80\x9373, and a small step backwards to 29\xe2\x80\x9353 in 1973\xe2\x80\x9374. In 1974, the Cavaliers moved into the brand-new Richfield Coliseum , located in a rural area thirty miles south of downtown Cleveland in Summit County (now part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park ). That season , the Cavaliers finished with a 40\xe2\x80\x9342 record, falling just short of a playoff berth. \n In the 1975\xe2\x80\x9376 season with Carr, Smith, Chones, Snyder, and newly acquired Nate Thurmond ; Fitch led the Cavaliers to a 49\xe2\x80\x9333 record and a division title. Fitch received the league\'s Coach of the Year award as the Cavs made their first-ever playoff appearance, and clinched their first Central Division Title. \n The Cavs won the series against the Washington Bullets , 4\xe2\x80\x933. Because of the many heroics and last-second shots, the series became known locally as the "Miracle of Richfield." They won Game 7, 87\xe2\x80\x9385 on a shot by Snyder with 4 seconds to go. Hampered by injuries, particularly to Jim Chones, the Cavs proceeded to lose to the Boston Celtics in Eastern Conference Finals of the NBA playoffs . \n Cleveland won 43 games in both of the 1976\xe2\x80\x9377 and 1977\xe2\x80\x9378 seasons, but both seasons resulted in early playoff exits. After a 30\xe2\x80\x9352 season in 1978\xe2\x80\x9379 , Fitch resigned as head coach. \n \n \n \n  \nFirst Logo of the Cavaliers 1970\xe2\x80\x931983 \n \n \n [ edit ] 1980\xe2\x80\x931983: Ownership under Ted Stepien \n The following season , after going 37\xe2\x80\x9345 under Fitch\'s successor Stan Albeck , original owner Mileti sold his shares to minority owner Joe Zingale. In 1980, after just a few months, Zingale sold the team to Nationwide Advertising magnate Ted Stepien on April 12, 1980. [ 2 ] The new owner oversaw the hiring and firing of a succession of coaches and was involved in making a number of poor trade and free agent signing decisions. The result of Stepien\'s questionable trading acumen was the loss of several of the team\'s first-round draft picks, which led to a rule change in the NBA prohibiting teams from trading away first-round draft picks in consecutive years. This rule is known as the "Ted Stepien Rule." \n Early on in his tenure, Stepien proposed to rename the team the "Ohio Cavaliers", part of a plan that included playing their home games not just in the Cleveland area but in Cincinnati and in non-Ohio markets such as Buffalo and Pittsburgh . He also made changes to the game day entertainment, such as introducing a polka -flavored fight song and a dance team known as "The Teddy Bears". \n The ensuing chaos had a major effect on both the Cavaliers\' on-court performance and lack of local support, going 28\xe2\x80\x9354 in 1980\xe2\x80\x9381 (Stepien\'s first year as owner), followed by an abysmal 15\xe2\x80\x9367 mark in 1981\xe2\x80\x9382 . The 1981\xe2\x80\x9382 team lost its last 19 games of the season which, when coupled with the five losses at the start of the 1982\xe2\x80\x9383 season , constitute the NBA\'s second all-time longest losing streak at 24 games . Although the team improved its record to 23\xe2\x80\x9359 the following year, local support for the Cavs eroded which eventually bottomed out that year by averaging only 3,900 fans a game at the cavernous Coliseum which seated more than 20,000. \n Though Stepien eventually threatened to move the franchise to Toronto and rename it the Toronto Towers, but brothers George and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in the mid-1980s and decided to keep the team in Cleveland (a decade later, Toronto would eventually receive an expansion franchise, the Toronto Raptors .) \n [ edit ] 1983-1986: The Gunds Take Over \n Shortly after purchasing the Cavaliers in 1983, the Gunds changed the team colors from wine and gold to burnt orange and navy blue. Furthermore, they officially adopted "Cavs" as a shorter nickname for marketing purposes, as it had been used unofficially by fans and headline writers since the team\'s inception. \n Under the coaching of George Karl , the Cavaliers failed again, and missed the playoffs, with a 28\xe2\x80\x9354 record, in the 1983\xe2\x80\x9384 . The Cavs finally returned to the playoffs in 1985 , only to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Boston Celtics in the first round. At this point, the team was in transition, led by dynamic players such as World B. Free , Roy Hinson and John Bagley . But in 1986, Karl was fired after 66 games. Interim head coach Gene Littles guided the team the rest of the way, which saw the Cavs finish just one game short of the playoffs. After the season, it was time for a major overhaul. During the 7 season period the Cavaliers had 9 head coaches; Stan Albeck , Bill Musselman , Don Delaney , Bob Kloppenburg , Chuck Daly , Bill Musselman (again), Tom Nissalke , George Karl , and Gene Littles . The only playoff appearance earned during this stretch was during the 1984\xe2\x80\x9385 season under George Karl losing to the Boston Celtics in the first round in four games (3\xe2\x80\x931). \n [ edit ] 1986\xe2\x80\x931992: One of the NBA\'s Best Teams \n \n \n \n  \n Brad Daugherty , the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA Draft and a 5 time NBA All-Star for the Cavs \n \n \n In 1986, the Cavaliers acquired, either through trades or the draft , Brad Daugherty , Mark Price , Ron Harper and Larry Nance . These four players (until Harper was later traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 for the rights to Danny Ferry ) formed the core of the team, under the direction of head coach Lenny Wilkens , that led the Cavs to eight playoff seasons in the next nine years, including three 50+ win seasons. \n In 1989, the Cavs were paired against the Michael Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs . In the fourth game of the best-of-five-series, Cleveland managed to beat the Bulls in overtime 108\xe2\x80\x93105 to level the series at 2\xe2\x80\x932. Home court advantage went to Cleveland. The game was evenly matched, until Cleveland managed to score on a drive and raise the lead by one, with three seconds left. Chicago called for a time-out. The ball was inbounded to Michael Jordan , who went for a jump shot. Cleveland\'s Craig Ehlo jumped in front to block it, but Jordan seemed to stay in the air until Ehlo landed. " The Shot " went in as time ran out, with Chicago winning the series 3\xe2\x80\x932. The buzzer-beater is considered one of Jordan\'s greatest clutch moments, the game itself one of the greatest in NBA history, and the series a classic. But the pinnacle of the Cavs\' success came in the 1991\xe2\x80\x9392 season, when they compiled a 57\xe2\x80\x9325 record and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals , losing again to the Chicago Bulls 4\xe2\x80\x932. \n [ edit ] 1993\xe2\x80\x932003: A decade of struggle \n \n \n \n  \n \xc5\xbdydr\xc5\xabnas Ilgauskas , a Cavs 1996 first round draft pick , a 2 time NBA All Star for the Cavs, and the team\'s all-time leader in games played, rebounds, and blocked shots. He is currently the Cavaliers\' assistant GM. \n \n \n Soon after, the Cavaliers entered into a period of decline. With the retirements and departures of Nance, Daugherty, and Price, the team lost much of its dominance and were no longer able to contest strongly during the playoffs. After the 1992\xe2\x80\x9393 season, in which the Cavs boasted a 54\xe2\x80\x9328 regular-season record but suffered an early exit from the playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals to the Chicago Bulls, Wilkens left to coach the Atlanta Hawks . \n Following the hiring of Mike Fratello as head coach starting with the 1993\xe2\x80\x9394 season , the Cavs became one of the NBA\'s best defensive teams under the leadership of point guard Terrell Brandon . But the offense, which was a half-court, "slow-down" tempo installed by Fratello, met with mixed success. Although the Cavaliers made regular playoff appearances, they were unable to advance beyond the first round. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs , the last of which Daugherty and Nance played in, the Cavaliers yet again met the Chicago Bulls in the first round, led by Scottie Pippen in the wake of Jordan\'s first retirement. The Bulls proved that it was not just the "Jordan Curse", and would prevail yet again sweeping the Cavs 3\xe2\x80\x930 in the first round encounter. \n In 1994, the Cavs moved back to downtown Cleveland with the opening of the 20,562-seat, state-of-the-art, Gund Arena . Known by locals as "the Gund", the venue served as the site of the 1997 NBA All-Star Game . The arena and the Cleveland Indians \' Jacobs Field were built together as part of the city\'s Gateway project. \n The Cavs revamped their starting lineup during the 1997 offseason. Sending guard Bobby Phills , and forward Chris Mills to free agency, and trading Terrell Brandon and Tyrone Hill to the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-team trade. They acquired All-Star forward Shawn Kemp from the Seattle SuperSonics (from the three-team trade involving Cleveland, Seattle and Milwaukee) and guard Wesley Person from the Phoenix Suns . Later on, players like Shawn Kemp and \xc5\xbdydr\xc5\xabnas Ilgauskas added quality to the team, but without further success. Fratello was fired following the shortened 1998\xe2\x80\x9399 season. \n Despite the arrivals of Andre Miller , Brevin Knight , Lamond Murray , Chris Mihm and Carlos Boozer , the Cavs were a perennial lottery team for the early part of the 2000s. The 2002\xe2\x80\x9303 team finished with the third-worst record in franchise history (17\xe2\x80\x9365), which earned them a tie for last place in the league and a 22.5 percent chance at winning the NBA Draft Lottery and the first overall selection. \n Ricky Davis received national attention on March 16, 2003 in game against the Utah Jazz . With Cleveland ahead in the game 120\xe2\x80\x9395, Davis was one rebound short of a triple-double with only a few seconds left on the clock. After receiving an inbound pass at the Cavs\' end of the floor, Davis banged the ball off the rim and caught it in attempt to receive credit for a rebound. Utah\'s DeShawn Stevenson took offense to this breach of sportsman\'s etiquette and immediately fouled Davis hard. [ 3 ] The play did not count as a rebound since firing at your own team\'s basket does not count as a shot attempt, and in fact is a technical foul under NBA rules. Since the referees had never seen anyone shoot at their own basket before, they were unfamiliar with the rule and play was allowed to continue. This (which led to Davis being nicknamed in Cleveland as "Wrong Rim Ricky") and countless other selfish acts contributed to the Cavs trading of Davis later that year and ushering in a new type of team. [ 4 ] \n [ edit ] 2003\xe2\x80\x932010: The LeBron James Era \n \n \n \n  \nFormer Cavaliers forward LeBron James , who was the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA Draft . While with the Cavs, he was the 2003\xe2\x80\x9304 Rookie of the Year, a 2 time NBA MVP (2009 and 2010), a 6 time NBA All Star , and the team\'s all-time leading scorer. \n \n \n Several losing seasons followed which saw the Cavaliers drop to the bottom of the league and become a perennial lottery draft team. After another disappointing season in 2002\xe2\x80\x9303 , the Cavaliers landed the number one draft pick in the NBA Lottery . With it, the team selected local high school phenomenon and future NBA MVP LeBron James . As if celebrating a new era in Cleveland Cavaliers basketball, the team\'s colors were changed from orange, black and blue back to wine and gold, with the addition of navy blue and a new primary logo. \n James\' status as both an area star (having played his high school basketball at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in nearby Akron ) and as one of the most highly touted prospects in NBA history has led many to view his selection as a turning point in the franchise\'s history. Embraced by Clevelanders as "King James," the 2003\xe2\x80\x9304 season offered great hope for the future, as James rose to become a dominating player, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year Award . Hope was even greater for the 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season. James increased his production in terms of points, rebounds, and assists per game. Despite the loss of Carlos Boozer in the offseason, James teamed with \xc5\xbdydr\xc5\xabnas Ilgauskas and Drew Gooden to form the core of the team. After a promising start, the Cavs began a downward spiral that eventually led to the firing of coach Paul Silas and general manager Jim Paxson . The team failed to make the playoffs that year, tied with New Jersey Nets for the final playoff spot with identical 42\xe2\x80\x9340 records; however, the Nets owned the tiebreaker due to having the better head to head record vs the Cavs. \n The Cavaliers made many changes in the 2005 offseason. Under new owner Dan Gilbert , the team hired a new head coach, Mike Brown , and a new general manager, former Cavaliers forward Danny Ferry . The team experienced success on the court in the following season , clinching their first playoff appearance since 1998 . After a first round win over the Washington Wizards , the Cavaliers rebounded from a 0\xe2\x80\x932 deficit in the second round against the Detroit Pistons , winning three consecutive games to come one game away from the conference finals. They lost a close Game 6 at home, and followed it with a 79\xe2\x80\x9361 loss in Game 7. The playoff rounds were a showcase for the emergence of LeBron James, who achieved many "youngest ever to..." records during the run. \n \n \n \n  \nCleveland Cavaliers versus Chicago Bulls in the Quicken Loans Arena in 2006 \n \n \n The Cavs continued their success in the 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season. The team earned the second seed in the East with a 50\xe2\x80\x9332 record, generating a series of favorable matchups in the playoffs . They battled 7th-seeded Wizards, who struggled with injuries near the end of the season. The Cavaliers swept this series 4\xe2\x80\x930, and defeated the New Jersey Nets , 4\xe2\x80\x932, in the second round. \n The Cavaliers faced the Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. After again losing the first two games at Detroit, the Cavaliers won the next three to take a 3\xe2\x80\x932 series lead. This time, the Cavaliers eliminated Detroit in Game 6. The wins included a 109\xe2\x80\x93107 double-overtime game at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Game 5, in which LeBron James scored the last 25 points for the Cavs, and his performance in this game is recognized as one of the best in NBA history. They continued to a dominant 98\xe2\x80\x9382 win at home in Game 6. Rookie Daniel "Boobie" Gibson scored a career-high 31 points in the series clincher, and the franchise won its first ever Eastern Conference Championship. \n The team\'s first trip to the NBA Finals was a short one, as they were outmatched and outplayed by the very strong San Antonio Spurs , who swept the Cavs 4\xe2\x80\x930. \n The Cavs took a step back in the 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season . They battled injuries and had many roster changes, including a three team trade at the trade deadline in which the team acquired F Joe Smith , G-F Wally Szczerbiak , F-C Ben Wallace , and G Delonte West . The Cavs finished 45\xe2\x80\x9337 and lost in the second round against eventual champion Boston of the playoffs . \n In the 2008 off-season, the team made a major change to its lineup, trading G Damon Jones and Smith (who later in the season rejoined the Cavs after being released by Oklahoma City ) for point guard Mo Williams . This trade was made in hopes of bringing another scorer to aid James. \n \n \n \n  \nTwo-time and current head coach Mike Brown , who in his first stint with the Cavs was NBA Coach of the Year for 2008\xe2\x80\x9309, and was the head coach of the Eastern Conference for the 2009 All Star Game . \n \n \n In the next season , the Cavs made astounding progress. They finished with a record of 66\xe2\x80\x9316, the winningest season in the franchise\'s history. The year marked other notable franchise records, including a 13-game winning streak, and road and home winning records. The Cavs entered the playoffs as the #1 seed in the NBA with home court advantage throughout the playoffs. They finished the season 39\xe2\x80\x932 at home, one win short of the best all-time home record . Head Coach Mike Brown won NBA Coach of the Year honors and LeBron James finished second in the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award and won the NBA MVP . The Cavs began the 2009 postseason by sweeping the 8th-seeded Detroit Pistons 4\xe2\x80\x930, winning every game by 10 or more points. In the conference semifinals, the Cavaliers faced the 4th-seeded Atlanta Hawks , who had defeated the Miami Heat in seven games. Despite the Cavaliers\' long layoff between the series they swept the Hawks 4\xe2\x80\x930, again winning each game by at least ten points, becoming the first team in NBA history to win eight straight playoff games by a double-digit margin. \n The Cavs then met the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Cavs lost Game 1 of the series 107\xe2\x80\x93106 at home despite James\' 49-point effort. Despite winning Game 2 by a score of 96\xe2\x80\x9395, with the help of a James buzzer beating three-pointer, it was not enough as Orlando eventually took the series in 6 games. \n On June 25, 2009, 4-time NBA Champion and 15-time All-Star center Shaquille O\'Neal was traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Cavaliers. The trade sent Ben Wallace and Sasha Pavlovic to Phoenix along with the 46th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft and $500,000 in cash considerations. [ 5 ] \n During the 2009 offseason, the Cavaliers signed wingman Anthony Parker , and forwards Leon Powe and Jamario Moon for the following season . On February 17, 2010, the Cavaliers acquired All-Star forward Antawn Jamison from the Washington Wizards and Sebastian Telfair from the LA Clippers in a three way trade. The Cavaliers originally lost \xc5\xbdydr\xc5\xabnas Ilgauskas (center) in this trade, but after being waived by Washington, he signed back with the Cavaliers on March 23, 2010 for the rest of the 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 season. The Cavaliers managed to finish with the NBA\'s best record for the second straight season, with a 61\xe2\x80\x9321 record. LeBron James was named the NBA MVP , for the second consecutive year. The Cavaliers defeated the Chicago Bulls 4\xe2\x80\x931 in the first round of the 2010 NBA Playoffs but, in a huge upset, lost to the Boston Celtics after leading the series 2\xe2\x80\x931, with the Celtics proceeding to win 3 consecutive games (afterwards, the Celtics went to the 2010 NBA Finals and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers 4\xe2\x80\x933.) Each team would suffer record-setting playoff defeats on home soil; the Celtics lost by 29, 124\xe2\x80\x9395, in Game 3, the greatest defeat in the history of the Boston Celtics in the playoffs, while the Cavaliers lost by 32, 120\xe2\x80\x9388, in Game 5. \n With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus then turned to James\' impending free agency. On July 8, 2010, James announced in a one hour show named The Decision on ESPN that he would be signing with the Miami Heat . The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed. Many LeBron James jerseys were burned, and the famous Nike "Witness" mural of James in downtown Cleveland was immediately taken down. Shortly after James made his announcement, Dan Gilbert, the owner of the Cavaliers, announced in an open letter on the Cavaliers website that James\' decision was a "cowardly betrayal" and promised a NBA championship for the Cleveland Cavaliers before LeBron James wins one, although James would win a championship before the Cavs with the Heat\'s championship win in 2012 . Despite being ridiculed for the letter by the media, Cleveland fans embraced the owner, even offering to pay the $100,000 fine given by the NBA. \n [ edit ] 2010\xe2\x80\x932011: Struggles and Infamy \n \n \n \n  \nFormer Cavs head coach Byron Scott , under whose watch the Cavs went 64-166 and went through the longest losing streak in major professional sports history at 26. \n \n \n During the 2010 offseason, the Cavaliers fired head coach Mike Brown , along with most of their coaching staff. General Manager Danny Ferry resigned on June 4, 2010 and Assistant General Manager Chris Grant was promoted to replace Ferry. On July 1, the Cavaliers hired former Los Angeles Lakers guard and former New Jersey Nets and New Orleans Hornets head coach Byron Scott as the 18th head coach in franchise history. \n The Cavaliers spent the rest of the 2010 off-season rebuilding their team after James\' departure. On July 23, they signed 2009 first-round pick Christian Eyenga . On July 26, the Cavs traded Delonte West and Sebastian Telfair to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ramon Sessions , Ryan Hollins and a 2013 second round draft pick. On July 30, the Cavaliers signed free agent Joey Graham On August 16, the Cavs signed undrafted Jamaican rookie Samardo Samuels to a three-year contract. After finishing the 2010 pre-season with a 6\xe2\x80\x932 record, the Cavs decided to waive Danny Green [ 6 ] and sign with the undrafted rookie Manny Harris , the Cavs also decided to exercise the fourth-year option with J.J. Hickson . [ 7 ] On November 18, the Cavaliers sent Christian Eyenga to the Erie BayHawks , the NBA D-League affiliate. [ 8 ] On December 27, the Cavs decided to waive Jawad Williams [ 9 ] and assign Samardo Samuels to the NBA D-League . [ 10 ] One day later, the Cavs signed Alonzo Gee . [ 11 ] On January 1 and 2 the Cavs recalled Samardo Samuels and Christian Eyenga , respectively, from the Erie BayHawks . [ 12 ] On February 24, 2011 the Cavs made two trade deadline deals, acquiring former All-Star Baron Davis and a 2011 first round draft pick from the L.A. Clippers , which ended up being the number one pick in the draft, for Mo Williams and Jamario Moon in return. [ 13 ] The Cavaliers also sent a 2013 second-round pick to the Boston Celtics for Luke Harangody and Semih Erden . Leon Powe was waived to create roster space. [ 14 ] \n On the court, the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season was a stark contrast from the previous season. They went from 61 wins in 2009-10 to a conference-worst 19, the biggest single-season drop in NBA history. This season also saw the Cavs lose 63 games, including a 26-game losing streak, which set an NBA record and tied the 1976\xe2\x80\x9377 Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the longest losing streak in any American professional team sport. [ 15 ] \n [ edit ] 2011\xe2\x80\x93present: Rebuilding with Kyrie Irving \n \n \n \n  \n Kyrie Irving , the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft , the 2011-12 Rookie of the Year, and a 2012-13 NBA All Star \n \n \n Having the second-worst team record in the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season as well as the Clippers\' first round pick that they received in the Mo Williams / Baron Davis trade, the Cavaliers had high odds of winning an early draft pick in the NBA Draft Lottery , with a 22.7% chance of their pick becoming #1 overall. [ 16 ] The selection acquired from the Clippers became the first pick in the lottery, while the Cavaliers original first round selection ended up as the #4 selection in the draft. The Cavs became the first team since the 1983 Houston Rockets to have two picks in the top five in the draft. The Cavaliers took Duke guard Kyrie Irving with the first pick, even though he only played 11 games in college. With the 4th pick, the Cavaliers selected Texas power forward Tristan Thompson . \n The Cavaliers used the next year to build around the two top-5 picks. On June 30, 2011, the team acquired small forward Omri Casspi and a lottery-protected first-round draft pick from the Sacramento Kings for forward J.J. Hickson . At the next year\'s trade deadline, the Cavaliers acquired forward Luke Walton and a first-round draft pick from the Los Angeles Lakers . The 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 lockout shortened season was an improvement for the Cavs, as they finished 21\xe2\x80\x9345. Irving was named NBA Rookie of the Year and was unanimously voted to the NBA All-Rookie First Team . Thompson was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team . \n For the second straight year in 2012, the Cavaliers had two first round picks in the NBA Draft . With their own #4 pick, they chose guard Dion Waiters from Syracuse , and with pick #17 (which was acquired from Dallas on draft night), they chose center Tyler Zeller from North Carolina . In August 2012, the Cavaliers signed veteran free agent swingman C.J. Miles . \n On April 18, 2013, the Cavaliers fired head coach Byron Scott after leading the team to a 64-166 record in three seasons. [ 17 ] The following week, the Cavaliers rehired Mike Brown as head coach, making him the second two-time head coach in team history, after Bill Musselman in the early \'80s [ 18 ]  [ 19 ] \n [ edit ] Season-by-season records \n Main article: List of Cleveland Cavaliers seasons \n [ edit ] Logos and uniforms \n [ edit ] The "original" wine and gold \n When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team\'s original jerseys were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter C in Cavaliers. In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \'Miracle of Richfield\' teams of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above Cleveland and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. \n The original logo was that of swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers\' NBA Development League affiliates, the Canton Charge . \n The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \'Miracle of Richfield\' team, while the gold \'Feathered C\' uniforms were used again in the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season, as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. \n [ edit ] The orange and blue \n In the 1983\xe2\x80\x9384 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavs logo (with a V in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987\xe2\x80\x9388 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor change in the 1989\xe2\x80\x9390 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. \n The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season, as part of the 20th anniversary of the 1986\xe2\x80\x9387 team, while the blue versions were worn in the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season as part of the franchise\'s 40th anniversary and as tribute to the 1988\xe2\x80\x9389 team. \n [ edit ] The orange, blue, and black \n Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994\xe2\x80\x9395 season, the Cavs changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994\xe2\x80\x9396 the word \'CAVS\' on the home uniforms were orange with black line, while the numbers are in black with white line, while \'CLEVELAND\' on the road uniforms were also orange with black line, while the number are in white with a black line. From 1996\xe2\x80\x9399 the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked. The word \'CAVS\' and the numbers on the home uniforms are in black with orange line, while the word \'CLEVELAND\' and the numbers on the road uniforms are in white with orange line. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \'CLEVELAND\' on the home uniforms and \'CAVS\' on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. \n In the 1999\xe2\x80\x932000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black line, while on the away jerseys, they feature the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue line. They were used until the 2002\xe2\x80\x9303 season. \n The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down the net, surrounded by a black square and the word \'CAVS\' in blue with black line below. \n [ edit ] The "new" wine and gold \n The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team\'s classic wine and gold scheme in the 2003\xe2\x80\x9304 season (metallic gold and crimson shade of wine), with navy blue added to the color scheme. The home jersey was white, with the word "Cavaliers" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player\'s name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player\'s numbers in navy blue, and wine and gold trim on the sides. The team\'s standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word "Cleveland," the player\'s name, and the player\'s numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team\'s third/alternate uniform was navy blue with the word "Cleveland", the player\'s name, and the player\'s numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold, and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers jerseys from the \'70s. \n The logo used is a gold sword piercing to the words \'Cleveland Cavaliers\' in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. \n [ edit ] The return to "old school" wine and gold \n The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 NBA season , to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used in the 1970s. The home uniform is white with a wine and gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband, and pant legs, "Cavaliers" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey, with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine colored with the same stripe trim, "Cleveland" in gold on the front of the jersey, and gold lettering on the name and number, with black shoes and socks. A third alternate uniform was added for the 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season, which is gold with "CAVS" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms. All uniforms have the team motto "All For One, One for All" stitched on the inside of the collar, and the secondary "Sword C" logo on the side of the pant legs. \n The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine and gold scheme. \n [ edit ] Special uniforms \n Beginning in the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season, the Cavaliers began wearing special "mash-up" uniforms (combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another) on select "Cavs Fanatic" Nights\xe2\x80\x94a promotion to plug the CavFanatic.com fan site \n In \'08\xe2\x80\x93\'09, the team wore the original "Feathered C" uniforms but with the 1994\xe2\x80\x932003 shade of blue combined with the classic wine and gold shade. \n In \'09\xe2\x80\x93\'10, the team wore their 1987\xe2\x80\x9389 uniforms, but in the classic wine and gold from the \'Miracle of Richfield\' era. \n In \'10\xe2\x80\x93\'11, the team wore the 2005\xe2\x80\x9310 checkerboard alternate uniforms, but in the 1994\xe2\x80\x932003 color scheme of blue, black and orange. \n In \'11\xe2\x80\x93\'12, the team wore a variation of the current uniform design, but in the classic shade of blue used from 1987\xe2\x80\x9394. The word \'CAVS\', player name and numbers are in the current lettering and in the wine and gold scheme. \n [ edit ] Home arenas \n \n Cleveland Arena (1970\xe2\x80\x931974) \n Coliseum at Richfield (1974\xe2\x80\x931994) \n Quicken Loans Arena (formerly called Gund Arena) (1994\xe2\x80\x93present) \n \n [ edit ] Cleveland Clinic Courts \n In 2007 the Cavaliers opened their new state-of-the-art practice facility, Cleveland Clinic Courts, in Independence, Ohio , a Cleveland suburb. It features many extravagant luxuries, 2 courts, a team meeting room, front office offices, as well as a kitchen among other features. Cleveland Clinic Courts replaces the former 1-court center the team used within Quicken Loans Arena . \n [ edit ] Players of note \n Further information: Cleveland Cavaliers all-time roster \n [ edit ] Current roster \n \n \n \n Cleveland Cavaliers roster \n \n \n v \n t \n e \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Players \n Coaches \n \n \n \n \n \n Pos. \n # \n Name \n Height \n Weight \n DOB (YYYY-MM-DD) \n From \n \n \n 4.0 !

\n \n \n [ edit ] Radio and TV \n WTAM AM 1100 is the flagship of a 16 station Cavaliers radio network. John Michael (play by play) and former Cavaliers star Jim Chones (analyst) are the radio team, with WTAM morning co-host/sports director Mike Snyder hosting the pregame/halftime/postgame shows. Either Chones (home games) or former Ohio State standout and NBA player Brad Sellers (road games) will join Snyder for the postgame show. \n On the television side, Cavaliers\' games air on FS Ohio , with select games (both regular season and playoffs) simulcast on WUAB channel 43 ( My Network TV ). The broadcast team includes play-by-play announcer Fred McLeod , analyst Austin Carr (a former Cavaliers star), and sideline reporter Allie Clifton. WKRK-FM midday co-host Jeff Phelps and former Cavaliers star Campy Russell host the pregame/halftime/postgame shows. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Mascots \n [ edit ] Past \n [ edit ] Whammer \n \n \n \n  \nFormer Cavs mascot Whammer \n \n \n Whammer is the former mascot of the Cavs. He is a polar bear who is said to have grown up in the tundra and still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavalier games. At halftime he used to dunk a basketball. Whammer\'s debut was in a November 9, 1995 game against the Chicago Bulls . However, Whammer\'s tenure coincided with a long dry spell in the franchise\'s history, with the Shawn Kemp playoff runs being an exception. In fact, few local fans even were aware that the Cavs had a mascot. \n Recently when Moondog , the current Cavaliers mascot was asked what Whammer was up to these days he responded "He e-mails the braintrust of the Cavs about twice a week trying to get his old job back. I throw him a bone occasionally and invite him back, mostly to mock him. Finally he\'s good for a laugh." [ 21 ] \n [ edit ] Current \n \n \n \n  \nThe current Cavaliers mascots, Sir C.C. (left) and Moondog (right) \n \n \n [ edit ] Moondog \n Moondog is the official mascot of the Cavaliers. Like a growing number of NBA Mascots, the character has a unique connection not just to the team, but to the city and surrounding area. Cleveland is known worldwide as the rock and roll city, due to famed Cleveland radio disc jockey Alan Freed , who popularized the phrase "rock and roll", breaking new ground and sparking a music explosion. \n Freed called himself the " Moondog ", and his listeners were "Moondoggers". When the Cavaliers looked to create a new mascot which represents the city, Moondog was a natural selection. Like Alan Freed, the mascot aims to be innovative, fun-loving, passionate and controversial. \n Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004. He is best known for his behind the back half-court shot and fierce loyalty to his Cavaliers. His first appearance was on November 5, 2003. \n [ edit ] Sir C.C. \n On November 27, 2010 during the Cavaliers- Memphis Grizzlies game, a new mascot debuted named Sir C.C., who is a swashbuckler character (a la The Three Musketeers ) and teams up with Moondog to provide gametime entertainment at home games. \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  "CC Sabathia, LeBron James and the naming of the Cleveland Cavaliers" .

That lone vote went to Carmelo Anthony. \n \n The NBA still does not have a unanimous MVP, though no one has come closer than James did this season. The Miami Heat star was presented with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy for the fourth time in his career on Sunday after collecting 120 of the 121 first-place votes, with Anthony of the New York Knicks picking up the lone remaining top choice. \n &#8220;It was probably a writer out of New York that didn&#8217;t give me that vote,&#8221; James said. &#8220;And we know the history between the Heat and the Knicks, so I get it.&#8221; \n However, Melo did surpass LeBron in jersey sales in April . He won&#8217;t be getting any hardware for that. \n A panel of 120 sports writers and broadcasters cast ballots in the NBA MVP voting, with a combined online fan vote also being taken into account. \n Shaquille O&#8217;Neal got every first-place vote but one in the 1999-2000 season, when one person cast his ballot for Allen Iverson \xe2\x80\x94 who finished seventh that year. This season, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder finished second, well ahead of Anthony, who was third and didn&#8217;t even appear on nine of the ballots cast. James was the only player listed on all 121 ballots; Durant was omitted from two, according to the results released by the NBA. \n For months, there really had only been two questions about this season&#8217;s MVP race: When will James get the award, and would the results be unanimous ? The first of those answers became known Friday, the other on Sunday, and even as he was on the dais to pick up the award the now-four-time MVP quickly started steering all of his attention back to the goal of helping the Heat win a second straight title. \n Miami hosts Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Monday night, when NBA Commissioner David Stern will present James with the trophy, largely just for the benefit of giving Heat fans a pregame reason to cheer. \n &#8220;My ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship,&#8221; James said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I brought was here for. That&#8217;s why I signed here as a free agent in 2010. It wasn&#8217;t to win MVP trophies. It was to win a championship \xe2\x80\x94 and win multiple championships \xe2\x80\x94 and that&#8217;s still my No. 1 priority.&#8221; \n James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, leading Miami to a league-best 66-16 record while shooting a career-high 56 percent. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four) have as many MVP awards, only Russell won four in a five-year span, and only Abdul-Jabbar went back-to-back twice, like James did with trophies in 2009 and 2010 and now again in 2012 and 2013. \n\t\n\t\n \n Sunday&#8217;s ceremony was filled with tributes and even some laughs, like when James&#8217; youngest son Bryce posed for photographers on stage while his father was speaking and older brother LeBron Jr. looked on \xe2\x80\x94 and when James&#8217; fiancee, Savannah Brinson, appeared on a congratulatory video and called him &#8220;Honeybunny.&#8221; \n &#8220;I know you&#8217;re embarrassed when I call you that,&#8221; Brinson said. &#8220;But whatever.&#8221; \n Over on the far side of the dais, set up on the floor of the Heat home court, James&#8217; teammates roared in hysterics \xe2\x80\x94 and Udonis Haslem made sure James knew that they were talking about Brinson&#8217;s pet name for her future husband. The 14 other Heat players were dressed casually in team garb, while James donned a dapper suit for the festivities. \n As he did on Saturday, a day after it became widely known that the award would be his again, James thanked his teammates. \n &#8220;I&#8217;d rather be sitting over there in shorts and a T-shirt, wondering what the hell they&#8217;re joking about, because I want to be a part of that joke,&#8221; James said. &#8220;And I hate being out of all the jokes. I want to know what was happening, OK, guys? I would much rather be with my guys over there because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. Without those guys, this trophy is not possible.&#8221; \n Much of the ceremony was tinged with emotion. \n Brinson&#8217;s mother dabbed tears away from her eyes when James thanked his soon-to-be in-laws for what they do for his family. Dwyane Wade (who was 10th in the voting) spoke in a hushed tone on the video, with soft music playing in the background as he told James to &#8220;continue to lead this team because we believe in you, so congratulations, Mr. MVP.&#8221; James seemed genuinely touched when dozens of students who are part of his &#8220;I Promise&#8221; educational program chanted for him when the proceedings were complete. \n &#8220;And all the ones that I&#8217;ve observed and I&#8217;ve watched and I&#8217;ve seen, somewhere they&#8217;ve always gotten better,&#8221; said Heat President Pat Riley, talking about all the game&#8217;s stars that he&#8217;s witnessed in his 46 NBA years. &#8220;They always got better as their career advanced. And most importantly, they&#8217;ve always made their teammates and their team better. In my humble opinion &#8230; I think the man that we&#8217;re looking at right here is the best of all of them.&#8221; \n James was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in scoring, rebounding and assists per game this season, had a record six straight games of scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent, became the youngest player in league history to break the 20,000-career-point plateau and won five of the six Eastern Conference player of the month awards. \n James has also became the second player in NBA history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, joining Larry Bird, who did it three times. The only other player to do it once was Jordan. \n &#8220;Four now,&#8221; Heat managing general partner Micky Arison said. &#8220;And more to come.&#8221; \n You May Also Be Interested In These Stories \n &#8216;The Other Guy&#8217; Braden Holtby Is Looking To Outperform Rangers&#8217; Lundqvist Melo Throws Up Bricks, Pacers Stun Knicks In Game 1 LeBron James Earns NBA MVP, Anthony Collects One First-Place Vote Yankees Shortstop Nunez Suffers Ribcage Injury, Set To Undergo MRI \n (TM and \xc2\xa9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Former   Cavs   head coach Mike Brown has let it be known that he is open to discussing a possible return to Cleveland, according to the Mary  Schmitt  Boyer of The Plain Dealer . Brown confirmed that he had not been contacted by Cleveland management, which has started a search to replace former head coach Byron Scott. He was fired after compiling a three-year record of 64-166. \n\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t Both Jackson and Brown seem to be confusing candidates. Brown because he coached the Cavaliers from 2005-2010 and was fired following LeBron James\' departure from Cleveland in the 2010 offseason. It seemed as if firing him was the team\'s way of welcoming in a new era&mdash;basically pressing the reset button. What would rehiring Brown do for the team? The supposed interest in Jackson makes plenty of sense from the   Cavs   side of things. He has 11 NBA championships to his name and has never had a season in which his team missed the playoffs, let alone had a losing record. However, Jackson has taken just two different head coaching jobs in his time in the NBA. First, in 1989, he signed up to coach a Chicago Bulls team with Michael Jordan entering his prime. In 1999, he took on the Los Angeles Lakers \' coaching gig and rode the tandem of Shaquille  O\'Neal  and Kobe Bryant to three straight NBA titles. After a year away from the sideline, he returned in 2005 to again coach the Lakers.  Shaq  may have departed, but the Lakers still had Kobe Bryant, who by then had emerged as an MVP-caliber talent. Clearly, Jackson is not experienced in a rebuilding team. Joining the Cavaliers would not only be out of the ordinary; it would be downright stunning. Cleveland\'s Luke Walton&mdash;who played under Jackson in Los Angeles&mdash; said , "I would be surprised if he came to this young of a team." Although unlikely, Cleveland is interested. As a coach or front-office consultant, bringing in one of the most respected figures in the NBA would do wonders for the franchise. And this Cavaliers team has some pieces to work with. Aside from   Kyrie   Irving, who may well be the best point guard in the league in the near future, they have Tristan Thompson, Dion Waiters, Anderson   Varejao  , buckets of cap space and eight draft picks in the next two drafts (including three first-rounders). \n\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t Add Jackson to the mix in some capacity, and it\'s hard to imagine a scenario where a team has more potential for greatness. LeBron, being a student of the game , knows what Jackson brings to the table. Jackson has coached three of the best players of the past two decades, and adding LeBron to that list would be another notch on his NBA belt. Though just speculation at this point, LeBron and Jackson in Cleveland could be mutually beneficial. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\t\t Flag \n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Props (0) \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n \n \n \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \n\tThis article is\n\n\t \n\t\t a duplicate \n\t\t offensive \n\t\t plagiarized  \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\n\t What is the duplicate article?

LeBron James on historic MVP: &#39;It&#39;s very humbling&#39; Jeff Zillgitt, USA TODAY Sports 6:37 p.m. EDT May 5, 2013    Miami Heat small forward LeBron James (6) was named NBA MVP for the fourth time. (Photo: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports)  Story Highlights LeBron James didn&#39;t lead league in any one traditional category, but in all around play He has won MVP four times, joining Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Russell, Chamberlain with at least that many James led the Heat to a 66-16 record  MIAMI \xe2\x80\x93 In what was a foregone conclusion all season, leaked Friday and made official on Sunday, Miami Heat forward LeBron James was named the 2012-13 NBA MVP. It was the fourth time in his 10-year career that James has won the award, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six MVPs), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four) as the only players to win MVP at least four times. "I try to be the best player on the court every night when I step on the floor," James said Sunday during the MVP ceremony on the court of American Airlines Arena. MVP: LeBron recalls first youth award UP NEXT: How Heat stack up with Bulls AWARDS: See all 2012-13 honorees James received 120 of the 121 first-place votes. One voter gave a first-place vote to New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony, preventing James from becoming the first player to win the award unanimously. Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant was second, Anthony third, Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul fourth, Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant fifth, San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker sixth, Spurs big man Tim Duncan seventh, Houston Rockets guard James Harden eighth, Thunder guard Russell Westbrook ninth and Heat guard Dwyane Wade 10th. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, Boston Celtics forward-center Kevin Garnett, Warriors forward David Lee, Denver Nuggets guard Ty Lawson, Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol and Chicago Bulls center Joakim Noah also received votes. James did not lead the league in any major category, but he led the league in all-around play, averaging 26.8 points, eight rebounds and 7.3 assists while shooting a career-high 56.5% from the field. He is the only player in NBA history, according to basketball-reference, to average at least 26 points, eight rebounds and seven assists and shot at least 56% from the field. He also averaged 1.7 steals and shot a career-high 40.3% on three-pointers, leading the Heat to the league\'s best record at 66-16. "I\'ve had an opportunity with my eyes to observe and to watch and to see players, great players, players who have championships and been most valuable players. They\'ve been winners and they\'ve been leaders," Heat president Pat Riley said. "In my humble opinion, in those 46 years, the man we\'re looking at right here is the best of all of them." During Miami\'s 27-game winning streak \xe2\x80\x93 the second longest streak in NBA history \xe2\x80\x93 James averaged 27 points, 8.1 rebounds, eight assists, 1.9 steals and shot 57.5% from the field. He had 15 double-doubles and two triple-doubles in those 27 games. "He\'s taken his game to another level and re-invented himself," Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. "He stayed uncomfortable and did not become complacent off his success. That\'s what the great ones do." He also became the first player to score at least 30 points and shoot at least 60% in six consecutive games. In the seventh game, he had 39 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in Miami\'s 110-100 victory at Oklahoma City. But he shot only 58.3%. "He\'s a total team guy," teammate and friend Dwyane Wade said. "He\'s humble. \xe2\x80\xa6 He\'s special. He understands the gift God gave him and he understands not many have it and it doesn\'t last for too long and he wants to make sure he maximizes it." The ceremony began with a video tribute from Heat staffers and teammate and was highlighted by Heat swingman Mike Miller and James\' fiancee Savannah Brinson, who revealed on the video tribute that she calls him "honey bunny." "Between the two of us, we now have four MVPs," Miller said. Riley spoke, Spoelstra spoke and then a genuinely appreciate appreciative James, who delivered many thank yous -- to his mom, Gloria James. "All you basically allowed me to do was have fun \xe2\x80\x93 to come home from school, do my homework and go out and play. I never knew it was hardships. I never knew what we were going through as a family because you should shielded that from me," James said. A thank you to his fiancee. "I want to thank you for the sacrifices that you make every single with me being a professional athlete, not being home all the time as you would want. \xe2\x80\xa6 I want to thank you so much, for what you do, not only for me, but for our boys (LeBron Jr. and Bryce)." James said. A thank you to his future in-laws "for the sacrifices they make every single day for my two kids. When I\'m not home and on the road, they take LeBron and Bryce to school and pick them up and take them to basketball practice and help with their homework. You guys are a blessing to me more than you guys know." To his friends and to the Heat organization, including his teammates. "Honestly, you guys see me sitting in this chair and I kept looking over at them, it\'s because I\'d rather be sitting over them with them \xe2\x80\xa6 in shorts, t-short, wondering what the hell they\'re joking about because I want to be a part of that joke and I hate being out of the jokes. I want to know what\'s happening. \xe2\x80\xa6 I\'d much rather be over there with those guys. Without those guys, this trophy\'s not possible." When told one vote went to Anthony, James said, "Well, it was probably a writer out of New York that didn\'t give me that vote, and we know the history between the Heat and the Knicks, so I get it." The lone vote for Anthony is reminiscent of the MVP results in 1999-2000 when Shaquille O\'Neal received 120 votes and Allen Iverson received one vote. Then-CNN sports anchor Fred Hickman admitted he voted for Iverson and provided his reason. Ultimately, James doesn\'t care about that. Backstage James told USA TODAY Sports that it\'s still surreal that this is his life. "Me and (friend) Brandon Weems were talking about being from Akron and where we are now, where I\'m at now," James said. "I could have never imagined that I\'d be in this position today. I just don\'t take it from granted. This isn\'t promised to anyone." James loves to say he is a student of the game and knows the history of the NBA. He explained why. "It was important to me because I wanted to be a part of this as a kid. It was a dream of mine," he said. "I wanted to know who paved the way from generation to generation. As great as Mike (Jordan) was, I wanted to know who paved the way for Mike? Who paved the way for Dr. J (Julius Erving)? Who paved the way for Kobe Bryant and Tracy McGrady?

It&#8217;s the closest thing to a moral victory Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert has notched since he put a hex on LeBron which came just shy of voodoo dolls after James bolted the Cava for the Miami Heat. \n \n \n Gilbert himself didn&#8217;t cast the dissenting vote, of course. The MVP award is left up to respected sports writers around the nation. LeBron has suggested that local journalist from Carmelo Anthony&#8217;s New York Knicks region may be to blame, without pointing the finger at anyone in particular. \n\n Since heading to Miami, LeBron James has won his first NBA Finals championship and is currently vying for his second. Dan Gilbert used a public letter to excoriate James for leaving the Cavs in which he predicted his team would win a championship before LeBron ever did. The Cavs have subsequently been a cellar dwelling team. But at least Gilbert can now say that he&#8217;s successfully hexed LeBron out of one career goal.

The Miami Heat star took 120 of 121 first-place votes in this year\'s balloting, giving him the award for the fourth time. Oklahoma City\'s Kevin Durant finished second and the New York Knicks\' Carmelo Anthony was third.  James\' selection was not unanimous, despite plenty of suggestions from people around the league in recent weeks that he was worthy of that honor. Anthony received the only other first-place vote from a panel of broadcasters and sports writers who cover the league.  The NBA released the results Sunday, when James was presented with the award.  Shaquille O\'Neal had been the closest to sweeping every first-place vote, taking 120 of a possible 121 in the 1999-2000 balloting.  James becomes the fifth player with at least four MVP awards, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. All four of James\' awards have come in a five-year span, something only done by Russell.  Full NBA playoff coverage from CBSSports.com  James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, leading Miami to a league-best 66-16 record while shooting a career-high 56 percent. It was no surprise that he won the award, given that it had been expected for months, with the lone questions being "When?" and "Was it unanimous?"  The first of those answers came on Friday, when it was learned that Sunday would be the day. The other came not long before James was honored on the floor of the AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami, where the Heat will open an Eastern Conference semifinal series Monday night against the Chicago Bulls.  "The guy is as good as it gets," Heat guard Dwyane Wade said.  \n  &copy; 2013 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Oklahoma\'s Kevin Durant finished second overall and the New York Knicks\' Carmelo Anthony, who received the other first-place vote, placed third. It was the fourth time in five years that the 28-year-old James had won the game\'s most prestigious individual award, elevating him among the sport\'s greatest players. "When people ask me, I tell them I just try to be the best player on the court every night I step on the floor," James said. Only four other players - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain - have won the trophy at least four times. Abdul-Jabbar holds the record for six MVP wins, one ahead of Jordan and Russell and two in front of Chamberlain and now James. James, who twice won the award with the Cleveland Cavaliers before moving to Miami, averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists during the 2012-13 regular season, where the Heat finished with the best record in the NBA. James was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in all three categories during the season. He shot a career-high from the field (.565) and from three-point range (.406). He produced a record streak of six straight games with at least 30 points and a .600-or-better field goal percentage. He received his award at a special presentation on Sunday, attended by his team mates, family and friends, and broadcast live on national television. In an emotional and heartfelt acceptance speech, James extended his thanks to everyone who had supported him both as a person and as a player. He turned to his team mates, who were wearing shorts and t-shirts, and said they deserved the award as much as he did, "Nothing I receive individually is possible without those 14 guys, and the sacrifices they make," he said. "This really doesn\'t mean much to me. I\'m humbled and I\'m happy about it but I wish it was 15 of these up here because what a great group of guys that allows me to be the MVP."

James, 28, became the youngest player in NBA history to win four MVPs after receiving 120 of 121 first-place votes by league media members and analysts. The lone other first-place vote went to Knicks star Carmelo Anthony . It was the second time a player fell one vote short of an unanimous MVP selection, with Shaquille O\'Neal also receiving 120 of 121 first-place votes in 1999-2000.  \n \n NBA MVP Voting \n \n \nLeBron James won his fourth MVP award Sunday, finishing just one vote shy of winning the honor unanimously. Carmelo Anthony was the only other player to receive a first-place vote.\n \n \n \n Player \n Points \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James \n 1,207 \n \n \n Kevin Durant \n 765 \n \n \n Carmelo Anthony \n 475 \n \n \n Chris Paul \n 289 \n \n \n Kobe Bryant \n 184 \n \n \n Others receiving votes: Tony Parker (86 points); Tim Duncan (65); James Harden (33); Russell Westbrook (9); Dwyane Wade (5); Stephen Curry (3); Kevin Garnett (1); David Lee (1); Ty Lawson (1); Marc Gasol (1); Joakim Noah (1).  \n "It\'s probably a writer out of New York that didn\'t give me the vote," James said during Sunday\'s award ceremony at AmericanAirlines Arena. "I know the history between the Heat and the Knicks. So I get it." A league spokesman said Sunday the NBA does not release the names of award voters or their ballots. But coming up short of a unanimous selection didn\'t overshadow a historic feat for James, who joined Michael Jordan , Bill Russell , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to win at least four MVP awards. James also joined Russell as the only players to win the award four times in five seasons. And it was the third MVP trophy James has collected in the span of 12 months. After winning the MVP last season in May, James said he would trade in his third Maurice Podoloff trophy for a first championship. Two months later, he led the Heat to a title and was named Finals MVP after beating Oklahoma City. Thunder forward Kevin Durant finished second to James in MVP voting for the second straight year, with Anthony third, Chris Paul fourth and Kobe Bryant fifth in votes. James is coming off the most efficient season he\'s ever had after shooting a career-high 56.5 percent from the field and 40.6 percent from 3-point range. He averaged 26.8 points, a career-high 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game. Now, James has his sights set on another evasive honor: Defensive Player of the Year. James was upset two weeks ago when he finished second for the second time in his career for that distinction. Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol was named defensive player of the year. "I tried harder to win defensive player of the year than I did MVP," James said. "That\'s my goal. Coach (Erik Spoelstra) had me guarding every position. We\'ll try again next year." But before that, James will try help the Heat defend their title when they open Game 1 of their second-round series against the Chicago Bulls on Monday. The Heat haven\'t played since they completed a four-game sweep of the Milwaukee Bucks on April 28 in the opening round.  \n \n\n SportsNation: NBA MVP Winners \n \n \nWhere does four-time MVP LeBron James stack up with the NBA\'s other multiple MVP winners? &bull; Rank \'Em! \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n "I\'ve been anxious for a while," James said Sunday. "But I\'m just excited to get back to basketball right now." During the ceremony, James acknowledged his fiancee and their two sons, his parents and a group of children who traveled to Miami from his youth foundation in Ohio. The Heat showed a video tribute to James that included jokes and congratulations from teammates and front-office staff. James laughed during a portion of the video when forward Mike Miller said the two of them now have four MVPs between them, "so let\'s keep it going." But there were also emotional moments for James during the video, especially when guard Dwyane Wade told the story when the two first spent significant time getting to know one another at the 2003 pre-draft camps. James was the first pick of the 2003 draft, with Heat center Chris Bosh going fourth to Toronto and Wade fifth to Miami. "God gave him the ability to be a very, very special player," Wade said of James. "You never know how long you\'re going to have that, and he never takes it for granted." Perhaps the highest praise for James came from Heat president Pat Riley, who started the ceremony by saying he\'s been around the NBA game for nearly 50 years as a player, coach, administrator or front-office executive. During that career span, Riley has played or coached with or against every other member of the four-MVP fraternity James joined with Sunday\'s MVP announcement. "Over these 46 years, I\'ve had an opportunity to see some great players -- and all the ones I\'ve observed, watched and have seen, they\'ve always gotten better," Riley said from the podium as he turned to James. "In my humble opinion, I believe the man right here is the best of them all." \n  Recommend 0 \n  Tweet 0 \n  Comments 0  Email \n  Print \n  Subscribe \n  Michael Wallace ESPN.com  Follow Archive  ESPN.com NBA reporter \n Blogs regularly on the Miami Heat \n 14 years covering the ACC, SEC, NFL and NBA  \n \n \n \n \n SPONSORED HEADLINES \n \n \n MORE NBA HEADLINES \n \n Pacers easily hold on to win Game 1 vs. Knicks \n Durant, Thunder hold off Grizzlies in Game 1 \n Nets say Carlesimo won\'t return as coach \n Heat: Rose won\'t be thorn in case of return \n \n MOST SENT STORIES ON ESPN.COM \n \n Report: Coach paid to sway McLemore to draft \n The Mag: Tom Brady\'s charmed life \n Ex-player: Lombardi championed gay rights \n Orb pulls away to win soggy Kentucky Derby \n \n \n \n \n ESPN Conversations   comments   + Add your comment View all comments  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n \n \n \n \n The NBA Playoffs On ESPN.com \n \n \n \n \n Follow the NBA playoffs on ESPN: Twitter / Facebook / Google+  \n\n LATEST CONTENT \n \n Dime: Celtics fall into an uncertain future \n Arnovitz: Grizzlies finally get their revenge \n Stein: Thunder move on from upset talk \n MacMullan: Time to say goodbye in Boston \n Shelburne: Clips out quicker than expected \n Next: Celtics | Clips | Hawks | Rockets \n TrueHoop: Pacers get it done on road \n O\'Connor: Knicks break series drought \n\n \n\n PLAYOFF FEATURES \n \n Thorpe: Postseason MVP ratings \n ESPN Forecast: East playoffs, Round 1 \n ESPN Forecast: West playoffs, Round 1 \n 2013 NBA Stat Geek Smackdown \n \n\n SERIES SCOUTING REPORTS \n \n Scouting Pacers-Knicks | Bulls-Nets \n Scouting Knicks-Celts | Pacers-Hawks \n Scouting Thunder-Rockets | Clips-Griz \n Scouting Spurs-Lakers | Warriors-Nugs \n \n\n SERIES PAGES \n \n Miami Heat (1) vs. Milwaukee Bucks (8) \n New York Knicks (2) vs. Boston Celtics (7) \n Indiana Pacers (3) vs. Atlanta Hawks (6) \n Brooklyn Nets (4) vs. Chicago Bulls (5) \n OKC Thunder (1) vs. Houston Rockets (8) \n San Antonio Spurs (2) vs. L.A.

Standing at 6&#160;ft&#160;8&#160;in (2.03&#160;m) and weighing in at 250 pounds (113&#160;kg), he has played the small forward and power forward positions for Miami, as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers . James has been an NBA champion , an NBA Finals MVP , a four-time NBA MVP , an NBA scoring champion , and the NBA Rookie of the Year . He has also been selected to nine NBA All-Star Games , eight All-NBA teams, and four All-Defensive teams. James is also the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer . \n James played high school basketball at St. Vincent&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron , Ohio . A two-time Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year , he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to the 2007 NBA Finals , their first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history, but the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs . In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Heat in a highly publicized free agency period. In his first year in Miami, the Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals , but lost to the Dallas Mavericks . James won his first championship in 2012 when the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , and was awarded the NBA Finals MVP Award. His career achievements and leadership role during the Heat\'s 2012 championship run have led a majority of basketball analysts, experts, and writers to consider him the best player in the NBA today. \n Off the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame as a result of numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America\'s most disliked and influential athletes. He has also been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials, and has hosted the ESPY Awards and Saturday Night Live . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Early life \n \n 1.1 Childhood and youth \n 1.2 High school career \n \n 1.2.1 Basketball \n 1.2.2 Football \n \n \n \n \n 2 NBA career \n \n 2.1 Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\xe2\x80\x932010) \n \n 2.1.1 Rookie season \n 2.1.2 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season \n 2.1.3 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season \n 2.1.4 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season \n 2.1.5 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season \n 2.1.6 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season \n 2.1.7 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season \n \n \n 2.2 2010 free agency \n 2.3 Miami Heat (2010\xe2\x80\x93present) \n \n 2.3.1 Signing \n 2.3.2 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season \n 2.3.3 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season \n 2.3.4 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season \n \n \n \n \n 3 International career \n 4 Player profile \n 5 Off the court \n \n 5.1 Personal life \n 5.2 Endorsements \n 5.3 Entertainment \n 5.4 Public image \n 5.5 Salaries \n \n \n 6 NBA career statistics \n \n 6.1 Regular season \n 6.2 Playoffs \n \n \n 7 Awards and honors \n 8 See also \n 9 Notes \n 10 References \n 11 Further reading \n 12 External links \n \n \n \n \n Early life \n Childhood and youth \n James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron , Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised LeBron on her own. [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] Growing up, life was often a struggle for LeBron and Gloria, who moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. [ 3 ] Realizing he would be better off with a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed LeBron to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced LeBron to basketball when LeBron was nine-years-old. [ 4 ] \n As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. [ 3 ] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. [ 5 ] Inseparable, they dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other they would attend high school together. [ 6 ] In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent-St. Mary High School , a largely white school, instead of their local public school. [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] \n High school career \n Basketball \n In his freshman year, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s varsity team. [ 9 ] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27\xe2\x80\x930, winning the Division III state title. [ 9 ] In his sophomore year, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, while also contributing 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. [ 10 ] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron\'s 5,492-seat capacity Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, local fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26\xe2\x80\x931 and repeated as state champions. [ 9 ] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and was selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first ever sophomore to do either. [ 13 ] \n Prior to the start of James\' junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now" by writer Ryan Jones. [ 14 ] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated , becoming the first ever underclass high school basketball player to do so. [ 15 ] With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, [ 9 ] he was again named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, [ 9 ] and became the first ever junior to win the boys\' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year Award . [ 16 ] St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23\xe2\x80\x934 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. [ 17 ] Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA Draft , unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA\'s draft eligibility rules which required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school. [ 18 ] During this time, James used marijuana to help cope with stress resulting from the constant media attention he was receiving. [ 19 ]  [ 20 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] \n In his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2 . [ 23 ]  Time Warner Cable , looking to capitalize on James\' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season. [ 24 ] For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, [ 13 ] was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, [ 25 ]  [ 9 ] and Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. [ 9 ] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games \xe2\x80\x93 the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the 2003 McDonald\'s All-American Game -, losing his NCAA eligibility and making it official he would enter the 2003 NBA Draft . [ 26 ] According to Ryan Jones, James left high school as "the most hyped basketball player ever". [ 27 ] \n During his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he accepted a Hummer H2 from his mother, who secured a loan for the vehicle utilizing LeBron\'s future earning power as a professional athlete. [ 28 ] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) as their guidelines state that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. [ 29 ] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for his posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. [ 29 ] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the season. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. [ 30 ] \n Football \n James played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s football team in high school. [ 11 ] As a sophomore, he was named first-team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. [ 10 ] His football career came to an end before his senior year when he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. [ 31 ] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League . [ 32 ]  [ 33 ] \n NBA career \n Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\xe2\x80\x932010) \n Rookie season \n James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the number one overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. [ 34 ] In his first professional game, he recorded 25 points against the Sacramento Kings , setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut outing. [ 35 ] In a late season match-up with the New Jersey Nets , he scored a season-high 41 points, becoming the youngest player in league history to score at least 40 points in a game at 19 years. [ 36 ] James was eventually named the NBA Rookie of the Year , finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game in their rookie season ( Tyreke Evans has since joined this group). [ 38 ] The Cavaliers finished the season 35\xe2\x80\x9347, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous season. [ 39 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames sizes up his defender in March 2005 as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers . \n \n \n 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season \n James recorded his first ever triple-double on January 19 of the 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season , becoming the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double at 20 years. [ 37 ]  [ 40 ] His play earned him his first NBA All-Star Game selection, where he added 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference . [ 41 ] On March 20, James scored a career-high 56 points against the Toronto Raptors , setting Cleveland\'s new single game points record. [ 42 ] With averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game to finish the season, he became the youngest player in league history to be named to an All-NBA Team , being selected to the All-NBA Second Team. [ 10 ] Despite a 30\xe2\x80\x9320 record to start the year, [ 42 ] Cleveland again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the year with a 42\xe2\x80\x9340 record. [ 43 ] \n 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season \n At the 2006 NBA All-Star Game , James led the East to victory with a 29 point, 6 rebound, 2 assist performance, and became the youngest ever winner of the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award at 21 years, 51 days. [ 44 ] For the 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season , he averaged 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 30 points per game. [ 37 ]  [ 45 ] He was considered a strong candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award , but eventually finished second in the voting to Steve Nash ; however, he was awarded co-MVP honors with Nash by The Sporting News , [ 46 ] and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. [ 47 ] \n Under James\' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998, [ 48 ] improving their record by 33 wins from three years prior. [ 49 ] In his playoff debut, he recorded a triple-double with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards . [ 50 ] He joined Johnny McCarthy and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to register a triple-double in their playoff debut. [ 50 ] For the series, James averaged 35.7 points per game and Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games. [ 51 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers were ousted by the defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons . [ 52 ] James\' final playoff averages were 30.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game. [ 37 ] \n After the playoffs, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60&#160;million contract extension with a player option for a fourth year. [ 53 ] Although it was for fewer years and less money than the maximum he could sign, it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season . [ 53 ] He discussed this decision with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh , fellow members of his 2003 draft class, who also re-signed with their respective teams while allowing them to be unrestricted agents in 2010. [ 54 ] \n 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames at the free throw line in April 2007. \n \n \n In the 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season , James averaged 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. [ 10 ]  [ 55 ] The Cavaliers finished the year with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed. [ 56 ] In the first round, Cleveland defeated the Wizards for the second straight season, sweeping them in four games. [ 57 ] For the series, James averaged 27.8 points, 7.5 assists, and 8.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] In the second round, James averaged 25.0 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.6 assists per game, leading the Cavaliers past the Nets in six games. [ 58 ]  [ 58 ] In the Eastern Conference Finals, Cleveland faced the Pistons in a rematch from the year before. [ 59 ] In Game 5, James notched a playoff franchise record 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, and scored 29 of the Cavaliers\' last 30 points including the game-winning lay-up with two seconds left. [ 60 ] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator Steve Kerr called it "Jordan-esque." [ 61 ] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in NBA playoff history. [ 62 ] Cleveland won the series to advance to the Finals versus San Antonio , losing in four games. [ 59 ] For the postseason, James averaged 25.1 points, 8.0 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game, although his Finals averages dropped to 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. [ 10 ]  [ 37 ] \n 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season \n During the 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season , James was named the All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27 point, 8 rebound, 9 assist, 2 block, and 2 steal performance. [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] On February 27, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 10,000 career points at 23 years, 59 days in a game against the Boston Celtics . [ 65 ] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty. [ 66 ]  [ 66 ] With seven triple-doubles to finish the year, James set a new personal and team record for triple-doubles in a season. [ 67 ] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title . [ 68 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008. \n \n \n Despite James\' individual accomplishments, Cleveland\'s record fell from the year before to 45\xe2\x80\x9337. [ 69 ] Seeded fourth in the Eastern Conference entering the playoffs , the Cavaliers were matched up with the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season. [ 70 ] In a pre-series interview, Washington guard DeShawn Stevenson stirred up controversy when he called James "overrated". [ 71 ] James answered by saying that responding to Stevenson would be like rap icon Jay-Z feuding with one-hit wonder Soulja Boy . [ 71 ] In the series, Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games before being eliminated in seven games by the Celtics in the next round. [ 72 ] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a "shootout". [ 73 ] \n 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames defends Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics in October 2008. \n \n \n In the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season , James finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first All-Defensive Team behind 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. [ 74 ]  [ 75 ] He also became the fourth player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories (total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) in one season. [ 76 ] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star Mo Williams , the Cavaliers went a franchise record 66\xe2\x80\x9316 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history. [ 77 ] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and a career-high 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the NBA MVP Award. [ 78 ]  [ 79 ]  [ 80 ] \n In the playoffs , Cleveland swept the Pistons in the first round. [ 81 ] At the end of Game 4, Detroit\'s home crowd started an MVP chant for James, who registered 36 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 assists that night. [ 82 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers swept the Atlanta Hawks . [ 83 ] In the Conference Finals, Cleveland were matched up with the Orlando Magic . [ 81 ] In Game 1, James scored 49 points with a 66 percent shooting rate in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. [ 62 ] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 84 ] The Cavaliers would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. [ 85 ] James later told reporters: "It\'s hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them, I\'m a winner. It\'s not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody beats you up, you\'re not going to congratulate them. ... I\'m a competitor. That\'s what I do. It doesn\'t make sense for me to go over and shake somebody\'s hand." [ 86 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attacks the basket in April 2009. \n \n \n 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season \n To address their lack of an inside presence against Orlando, the Cavaliers traded for center Shaquille O\'Neal before the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season. [ 87 ] To give James more scoring help, Cleveland also added All-Star Antawn Jamison to their roster at the trading deadline. [ 88 ] On March 13, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 15,000 career points at 25 years, 79 days during a game against the Chicago Bulls . [ 89 ] At the end of the season, he was named NBA MVP for the second consecutive year with averages of 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, a career-high 8.6 assists, 1 block, and 1.6 steals per game on 50 percent shooting. [ 90 ] The Cavaliers also finished the regular season with the league\'s best record for the second straight year. [ 91 ] \n In the playoffs , the Cavaliers beat the Chicago Bulls in the first round but fell to the Celtics in the second round. [ 92 ] James was heavily criticized for not playing well, particularly in Game 5 of the series when he shot only 20 percent on 14 shots, scoring 15 points. [ 93 ] At the conclusion of the game he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland\'s home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever. [ 94 ] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists, but on just 38 percent shooting with 9 turnovers. [ 92 ] \n 2010 free agency \n \n \n \n  \nJames takes a free throw against the Atlanta Hawks in April 2010. \n \n \n Main article: The Decision (TV special) \n James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01&#160;am EDT on July 1, 2010. [ 95 ] During his free agency he was courted by several teams including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers , Miami Heat , Knicks, New Jersey Nets , and Cavaliers. [ 96 ] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat. [ 97 ] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut , raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities. [ 98 ]  [ 99 ] The day before the special, fellow free agents Bosh and Wade had also announced they would sign with Miami. [ 100 ]  [ 101 ] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. [ 102 ]  [ 103 ] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. [ 104 ] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson . [ 102 ]  [ 105 ] \n James drew immense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James\' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. [ 106 ] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James\' actions. [ 107 ] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. [ 108 ] Former NBA players including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as "the guy". [ 109 ]  [ 110 ]  [ 111 ] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision . [ 112 ]  [ 113 ] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America\'s most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior. [ 114 ]  [ 115 ] The phrase "taking my talents to South Beach" became a punch line for critics. [ 116 ]  [ 117 ] \n Immediately following The Decision , James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. [ 118 ] Since then, he has expressed remorse over his actions. During the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season, he said he "probably would do it a little bit different ... But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my decision." [ 119 ] James relented about the special before the 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season: "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." [ 115 ] \n Miami Heat (2010\xe2\x80\x93present) \n Signing \n James officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, completing a sign-and-trade six-year contract with the team. [ 120 ] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982 . [ 121 ] Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the collective bargaining agreement , he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support. [ 122 ] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new "big three" at the American Airlines Arena , an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. [ 123 ] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. [ 124 ]  [ 125 ] Outside of Miami the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James. [ 126 ]  [ 127 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Miami Heat . \n \n \n 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season \n Throughout the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season , James embraced the villain role bestowed upon him by the media. He later said that the negativity surrounding him as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period "basically turned me into somebody I wasn\'t ... You start to hear \'the villain,\' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I\'ve never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that\'s mentally. That\'s not the way I play the game of basketball." [ 128 ] He often played the point guard role that Riley sold to him during free agency, and in an early season victory versus the Minnesota Timberwolves , he was Miami\'s primary ball handler and registered a game-high 12 assists, the most ever by a Heat forward. [ 129 ]  [ 130 ]  [ 131 ]  [ 132 ]  [ 129 ] On December 2, he returned to Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. [ 133 ]  [ 134 ] He finished his debut season on the Heat with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game on 51 percent shooting. [ 47 ] \n Entering the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and the Celtics in the second round. [ 135 ] In the Conference Finals, Miami met the first-seeded Bulls, winning in five games. [ 135 ] In the 2011 NBA Finals , Miami stumbled against the Dallas Mavericks , losing in six games despite holding a 2\xe2\x80\x931 series lead going into Game 4. [ 135 ] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only 3 points in fourth quarters in the series. [ 136 ] His scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the lowest such drop-off in league history. [ 137 ] \n 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season \n Humbled by Miami\'s loss to Dallas, James spent the offseason attempting to improve himself as a basketball player and a person, and worked with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] The Heat opened the lockout-shortened 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season on a strong note, finishing January with a 16\xe2\x80\x935 record and matching their best start to a season in franchise history. [ 140 ] In the 2012 All-Star Game , James tied Kevin Durant with a game-high 36 points and tied the All-Star Game record of six three-pointers made. [ 141 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named league MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting. [ 142 ] \n The Heat entered the playoffs with the second seed in the Eastern Conference. [ 143 ] They defeated the Knicks in five games in the first round before falling behind 2\xe2\x80\x931 to Indiana in the second round. [ 143 ] In Game 4, James turned in one of the best all-around performances of his career, registering 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists in a winning effort on the road. [ 144 ] Miami eventually won the series in six games. [ 143 ] In the Conference Finals, the Heat again faced the Celtics , winning the first two games before dropping the next three. [ 143 ] Facing elimination, James lead Miami to victory by scoring 45 points in Game 6, making 19 of 26 shot attempts for a 73 percent shooting rate. [ 145 ] He also contributed 15 rebounds and 5 assists, becoming the second player in league history to do so besides Wilt Chamberlain for the San Francisco Warriors in 1964 . [ 146 ] The Heat won Game 7 to advance to the 2012 NBA Finals . [ 143 ] \n In the Finals, the Heat were matched up with the Oklahoma City Thunder . [ 143 ] Despite holding a 13-point first half lead in Game 1, Miami lost the first game of the series. [ 147 ] In Game 2, the Heat again built a double-digit lead, this time holding on and winning to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 148 ] Back in Miami, the Heat took Game 3 to go up 2\xe2\x80\x931. [ 149 ] Game 4 proved to be a memorable one for James. With five minutes left in the game, he started experiencing leg cramps and was carried off the floor. He returned soon after and hit a three-pointer with 2:51 left to give Miami a three point lead they did not relinquish. [ 150 ] In Game 5, James registered his only triple-double of the season with 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second ever championship and James\' first championship. [ 151 ] James was unanimously voted the NBA Finals MVP with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. [ 152 ] His final playoff averages were 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. [ 153 ] \n 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season \n On January 16 of the 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season , James became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points at 28 years, 17 days during a game against the Golden State Warriors . [ 154 ] In February, he had a "month for the ages". [ 155 ] To start the month, he became the first player in league history to score at least 30 points and shoot at least 60 percent in six straight games. [ 156 ] He finished the month having made 139 of 217 field goals, becoming the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in March 1983 to take more than 200 shots in a calendar month and make at least 64 percent of them. [ 157 ] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the second longest in league history . [ 158 ] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66-16 record. [ 159 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named the NBA Most Valuable Player for the fourth time, after averaging 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting. He received 120 out of 121 first-place votes, one shy of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. He also finished second in voting for the Defensive Player of the Year award, which he expressed interest in winning. [ 160 ] \n International career \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a shot over China\'s Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. \n \n \n James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece . [ 161 ] U.S. Olympic coach Larry Brown said that James, accustomed to being a star, was not 100% receptive to a reduced role. [ 162 ] James spent the Olympics mostly on the bench without quality playing time, [ 163 ]  [ 164 ] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. [ 161 ] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up. [ 161 ]  [ 165 ] James felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play". [ 166 ] His attitude during the Olympics was described as "disrespectful" and "distasteful" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey , respectively. [ 167 ]  [ 168 ] \n At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan , James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. [ 169 ]  [ 170 ] The team finished the tournament with an 8\xe2\x80\x931 record, winning another bronze medal. [ 169 ] James\' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen , who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members. [ 167 ]  [ 171 ] \n Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team , Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. [ 167 ]  [ 172 ] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007 , he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. [ 173 ]  [ 174 ] Team USA went 10\xe2\x80\x930, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China . [ 161 ] James credited the team\'s attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: "I don\'t think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now." [ 164 ] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000 . [ 175 ] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain. [ 175 ] \n James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England . [ 176 ]  [ 177 ] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant , who would soon be 34, stepping back. [ 178 ]  [ 179 ]  [ 180 ] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. [ 112 ]  [ 181 ]  [ 182 ]  [ 183 ] During the Games, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history. [ a ] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. [ 185 ] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men\'s basketball history. [ 161 ]  [ 185 ] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. [ 186 ] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now." [ 187 ] \n Player profile \n \n \n \n  \nJames drives to the basket in March 2008. \n \n \n Standing at six feet, eight inches tall and weighing in at 250 pounds, James has been called the best physical specimen in sports by some sports analysts. [ 188 ]  [ 189 ] He has started at the small forward and power forward positions, but can also play and guard the other three positions. [ 153 ] With career averages of 27.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game, [ 47 ] he is considered one of the most versatile players in the NBA, [ 190 ] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. [ 37 ]  [ 191 ] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, and All-Defensive honors every season since 2009. [ 47 ] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain , and Bill Russell . [ 192 ] Since 2011, James has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN\'s #NBArank project. [ 193 ]  [ 194 ]  [ 195 ] \n In Cleveland, James was used as an on-ball point forward, and his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented. [ 190 ] He established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in the NBA, leading the league in completed traditional three point plays in various seasons. [ 10 ] He also regularly ranked as one of the league leaders in rebounds for his position. [ 196 ]  [ 197 ] Despite his award-worthy play with the Cavaliers, he was criticized for not developing a reliable jump shot or post game, [ 198 ] areas he improved in Miami, where Heat coach Eric Spoelstra changed James\' role to a more unconventional one. [ 190 ] James began spending more time in the post and shooting less three pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. [ 190 ]  [ 47 ] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat\'s "pass-happy" offense. [ 199 ] \n James\' clutch play has been the subject of much scrutiny throughout his career. He has been repeatedly criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games. [ 200 ]  [ 201 ] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James. [ 202 ] On the other hand, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant. [ 203 ] Additionally, a 2012 feature by ESPN ranked three of James\' playoff performances as some of the greatest in NBA history. [ 62 ] \n Off the court \n Personal life \n James has two children with his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The first, LeBron James Jr., was born on October 6, 2004, [ 204 ] and the second, Bryce Maximus James, on June 14, 2007. [ 62 ]  [ 204 ] They currently reside in Coconut Grove , a Miami suburb, where James bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9&#160;million. [ 205 ] James became engaged to Brinson on December 31, 2011, proposing to her at a party to celebrate New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve and his 27th birthday. [ 206 ] \n Endorsements \n James has endorsement contracts with Nike , Sprite , Glac\xc3\xa9au , Bubblicious , Upper Deck , McDonald\'s , State Farm , Dunkin\' Brands , and Audemars Piguet . [ 207 ]  [ 208 ]  [ 209 ]  [ 210 ] His initial contract with Nike was worth almost $90 million. [ 211 ] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of James\' rights, and as part of the deal, he and his manager Maverick Carter were granted minority stakes in the English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. [ 212 ] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world\'s highest-paid athletes. [ 213 ]  [ 214 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames is a minority stakeholder of Liverpool F.C. \n \n \n Entertainment \n James, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel , co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards . [ 215 ] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd season premiere of Saturday Night Live . [ 216 ] In 2009, he was featured in the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game , which chronicled his high school years. [ 217 ] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage . [ 218 ] \n Public image \n In 2010, James was ranked by Forbes as the second most influential athlete behind Lance Armstrong . [ 219 ] As a member of the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on their world headquarters throughout his tenure with the team. [ 220 ] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees dressed in a Yankees hat. [ 221 ] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision , he has been listed as one of the most disliked athletes. [ 222 ]  [ 223 ] \n A philanthropist, James is an active supporter of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America, Children\'s Defense Fund , and ONEXONE . [ 224 ] He has also established his own charity foundation called the LeBron James Family Foundation, based out of Akron. [ 225 ] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes.

[ 229 ] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding B\xc3\xbcndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong , a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest. [ 227 ]  [ 228 ] \n While James has largely avoided political issues, he drew criticism in 2007 when he declined to sign a petition started by his Cavaliers teammate Ira Newble regarding the Chinese government \'s alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan , stating that he did not know enough about the issue. [ 230 ]  [ 231 ] A year later, James did talk publicly about the issue, saying, "At the end of the day we\'re talking about human rights. And people should understand that human rights and people\'s lives are in jeopardy. We\'re not talking about contracts here. We\'re not talking about money. We\'re talking about people\'s lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract." [ 232 ]  [ 233 ] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Barack Obama . [ 234 ] On October 29, 2008, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama\'s 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement. [ 235 ] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert. [ 235 ] \n Salaries \n \n All salaries from Basketball Reference.

S'LeBron James named NBA Most Valuable Player   NEWS [ Home ]  Home | U.S. | World   LeBron James named NBA Most Valuable Player Reuters - 2 hrs ago   (Reuters) - Miami Heat forward LeBron James was named the National Basketball Association\'s Most Valuable Player for the 2012-13 season on Sunday. James received 120 first-place votes from the panel of 121 sports writers and broadcasters selected to choose the award. Oklahoma\'s Kevin Durant finished second overall and the New York Knicks\' Carmelo Anthony, who received the other first-place vote, placed third. It was the fourth time in five years that the 28-year-old James had won the game\'s most prestigious individual award, elevating him among the sport\'s greatest players. "When people ask me, I tell them I just try to be the best player on the court every night I step on the floor," James said. Only four other players - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain - have won the trophy at least four times. Abdul-Jabbar holds the record for six MVP wins, one ahead of Jordan and Russell and two in front of Chamberlain and now James. James, who twice won the award with the Cleveland Cavaliers before moving to Miami, averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists during the 2012-13 regular season, where the Heat finished with the best record in the NBA. James was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in all three categories during the season. He shot a career-high from the field (.565) and from three-point range (.406). He produced a record streak of six straight games with at least 30 points and a .600-or-better field goal percentage. He received his award at a special presentation on Sunday, attended by his team mates, family and friends, and broadcast live on national television. In an emotional and heartfelt acceptance speech, James extended his thanks to everyone who had supported him both as a person and as a player. He turned to his team mates, who were wearing shorts and t-shirts, and said they deserved the award as much as he did, "Nothing I receive individually is possible without those 14 guys, and the sacrifices they make," he said. "This really doesn\'t mean much to me. I\'m humbled and I\'m happy about it but I wish it was 15 of these up here because what a great group of guys that allows me to be the MVP." (Reporting by Julian Linden in New York; Editing by Gene Cherry)   14 comments   Wonder if he\'ll complain about the first place vote that went to Melo? My Jana, 3 hrs ago    I never hear about him being in trouble with the law or not paying child support or out of control partying-great job Lebron. pinkstar, 1 hr ago    LeBron is overrated. Duckman, 3 hrs ago    Should have been 5 straight. If it wasn\'t for the haters when he left Cleveland it would have been. Ken, 1 hr ago    This is a watered down league...not as impressive as the others on this list... I wish LeBron played in the 80s-90s when the game had players on EVERY team. Even sixth man of the year used to matter...He should win this award every year he plays, he is talented beyond the players in todays game... but I would love to see him playing when flagrant fouls resulted in a fight rather than a twitter war, when hand checking was still allowed, when the teams bench had more than roster filling scrubs waiting to play... just saying, today\'s game is weak. It\'s hard for me to crown LeBron beyond the talent he faces these days...

Well Carmelo Anthony doesn\'t, because he hasn\'t. He\'s been trapped in this bubble I like to refer to as "the first round." He escaped once, but he never got very far, and hasn\'t broke out since. Melo has been trying to open the same door for nine years but still can\'t figure out which way the knob turns. One of the reasons Anthony struggles in the playoffs is because of his inability to adjust. And his inability to adjust stems from his lack of on-court maturity. It appears as if Melo just expects and relies on his talent alone to carry him and his team. And that just doesn\'t work in a seven-game playoff series. \n\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJoe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t Anthony doesn\'t have a counter for adversity. With J.R. Smith out of the lineup, Melo \'s answer was to take it upon himself and hopefully make more shots. Every scorer and leader needs confidence, but Melo doesn\'t channel his appropriately. One of the greatest compliments you can give an athlete is that they make their teammates better. That\'s one of LeBron James \' most glowing qualities. Both low-profile reserves and high-profile stars want to play alongside him. Something tells me Anthony doesn\'t have that effect on other players. In Game 4 against Boston , Anthony missed 25 shots (10-of-35). LeBron James missed 22 shots total in the entire first round. James has figured out that scoring isn\'t the only way he can personally help the team. Anthony\'s solution to every obstacle is putting on a cape and going into hero mode. Melo either has to learn how to contribute when the defense takes away his looks or figure out how to score when his jumper isn\'t falling. Check out his shot charts from Games 4 and 5. He\'s been ineffective in back-to-back games without being able to connect from the perimeter. \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t Anthony is just too good for him to allow his jumper to dictate whether his team wins or loses. And while Melo suffers from a lack of on-court discipline, he also struggles with off-court maturity as a leader. LeBron James has gotten the hang of this whole "postseason" thing. To be frank, James had it all along, for the most part. Despite leading a core consisting of Larry Hughes, Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Drew Gooden to the NBA Finals in just his fourth year in the league, we still gave James crap for not being able to close or get over the hump. Over the years, James has picked up on what works and what doesn\'t. And he\'s sent whatever doesn\'t work straight to the lab. James\' preparation is exemplary. He seems laser focused. No Twitter, no headlines, no nonsense. \n\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tUSA TODAY Sports\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t The Knicks are in the news after showing up in all black for Boston\'s "funeral," a gimmicky motivational tactic that seemed childish and frivolous. Do you think the Heat, a group who\'s "been here before," would pull a stunt like that? They wouldn\'t need to. With Miami, you never have to wonder whether it will show up. Most of that has to do with James\' command in the huddle. With the Knicks, fans have to cross their fingers hoping it\'s not going to be "one of those games." New York is the No. 2 seed&mdash;the supposed only team in the East who can challenge Miami in a series. At this point, the premise of the new Will Smith movie seems more plausible than the thought of Anthony\'s Knicks upsetting James\' Heat . I hate to say it, but Anthony may never be on James\' level as an NBA competitor. He\'s just missing that "grown man" quality that guys like James, Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan have used to plow through adversity and take home a title. Anthony\'s immaturity as a player has cost the Knicks games, but his immaturity as a leader could end up costing them the season. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\t\t Flag \n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Props (0) \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n \n \n \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \n\tThis article is\n\n\t \n\t\t a duplicate \n\t\t offensive \n\t\t plagiarized  \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\n\t What is the duplicate article? \n\t Why is this article offensive? \n\t Where is this article plagiarized from? \n\t Why is this article poorly edited? \n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t Flag This Article \n \n\n\t\n\t \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t More Articles You\'ll Like \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n    \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t Latest 2-Round NBA Mock Draft \n\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n    \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t Must-See Plays from Playoffs 2nd Week \n\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n    \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t Ideal FA Signing for Each NBA Team \n\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t \n\t\n\t\t\n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tor sign up to post a comment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Post Comment \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t Sort By Most Popular \n\t\t\t\t\t Sort By Newest First \n\t\t\t\t\t Sort By Oldest First \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t169\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Comments \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\n\n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\tLoading comments...\n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t just now \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t posted just now \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t 0 : Like \n\t\t\t\t Reply \n\t\t\t\t Flag as Offensive Edit Delete \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\n \n \t Loading... \n \t Nobody has liked this comment yet \n \n\n \n\t\t Edit comment \n\t\t Delete comment \n\t\t Flag as offensive \n\t\t\n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t Cancel \n\t\t \n\t\t Update Comment \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t This comment and all replies have been deleted \n\t\t This comment has been deleted \n\t\t\t Undo delete \n\t\t \n\t \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\t\t Follow B/R on Facebook \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t\n\n \n \n \n\n\t \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n    \n    \n    NBA Lead Writer\n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t \n\t\t Jonathan Wasserman \n\t\t\n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tI\'m the NBA draft guy.

Standing at 6&#160;ft&#160;8&#160;in (2.03&#160;m) and weighing in at 250 pounds (113&#160;kg), he has played the small forward and power forward positions for Miami, as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers . James has been an NBA champion , an NBA Finals MVP , a four-time NBA MVP , an NBA scoring champion , and the NBA Rookie of the Year . He has also been selected to nine NBA All-Star Games , eight All-NBA teams, and four All-Defensive teams. James is also the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer . \n James played high school basketball at St. Vincent&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron , Ohio . A two-time Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year , he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to the 2007 NBA Finals , their first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history, but the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs . In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Heat in a highly publicized free agency period. In his first year in Miami, the Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals , but lost to the Dallas Mavericks . James won his first championship in 2012 when the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , and was awarded the NBA Finals MVP Award. His career achievements and leadership role during the Heat\'s 2012 championship run have led a majority of basketball analysts, experts, and writers to consider him the best player in the NBA today. \n Off the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame as a result of numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America\'s most disliked and influential athletes.

[ 3 ] Realizing he would be better off with a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed LeBron to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced LeBron to basketball when LeBron was nine-years-old. [ 4 ] \n As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. [ 3 ] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. [ 5 ] Inseparable, they dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other they would attend high school together. [ 6 ] In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent-St. Mary High School , a largely white school, instead of their local public school. [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] \n High school career \n Basketball \n In his freshman year, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s varsity team. [ 9 ] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27\xe2\x80\x930, winning the Division III state title. [ 9 ] In his sophomore year, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, while also contributing 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. [ 10 ] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron\'s 5,492-seat capacity Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, local fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26\xe2\x80\x931 and repeated as state champions. [ 9 ] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and was selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first ever sophomore to do either. [ 13 ] \n Prior to the start of James\' junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now" by writer Ryan Jones. [ 14 ] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated , becoming the first ever underclass high school basketball player to do so. [ 15 ] With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, [ 9 ] he was again named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, [ 9 ] and became the first ever junior to win the boys\' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year Award . [ 16 ] St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23\xe2\x80\x934 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. [ 17 ] Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA Draft , unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA\'s draft eligibility rules which required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school. [ 18 ] During this time, James used marijuana to help cope with stress resulting from the constant media attention he was receiving. [ 19 ]  [ 20 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] \n In his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2 . [ 23 ]  Time Warner Cable , looking to capitalize on James\' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season. [ 24 ] For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, [ 13 ] was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, [ 25 ]  [ 9 ] and Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. [ 9 ] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games \xe2\x80\x93 the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the 2003 McDonald\'s All-American Game -, losing his NCAA eligibility and making it official he would enter the 2003 NBA Draft . [ 26 ] According to Ryan Jones, James left high school as "the most hyped basketball player ever". [ 27 ] \n During his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he accepted a Hummer H2 from his mother, who secured a loan for the vehicle utilizing LeBron\'s future earning power as a professional athlete. [ 28 ] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) as their guidelines state that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. [ 29 ] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for his posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. [ 29 ] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the season. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. [ 30 ] \n Football \n James played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s football team in high school. [ 11 ] As a sophomore, he was named first-team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. [ 10 ] His football career came to an end before his senior year when he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. [ 31 ] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League . [ 32 ]  [ 33 ] \n NBA career \n Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\xe2\x80\x932010) \n Rookie season \n James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the number one overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. [ 34 ] In his first professional game, he recorded 25 points against the Sacramento Kings , setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut outing. [ 35 ] In a late season match-up with the New Jersey Nets , he scored a season-high 41 points, becoming the youngest player in league history to score at least 40 points in a game at 19 years. [ 36 ] James was eventually named the NBA Rookie of the Year , finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game in their rookie season ( Tyreke Evans has since joined this group). [ 38 ] The Cavaliers finished the season 35\xe2\x80\x9347, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous season. [ 39 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames sizes up his defender in March 2005 as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers . \n \n \n 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season \n James recorded his first ever triple-double on January 19 of the 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season , becoming the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double at 20 years. [ 37 ]  [ 40 ] His play earned him his first NBA All-Star Game selection, where he added 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference . [ 41 ] On March 20, James scored a career-high 56 points against the Toronto Raptors , setting Cleveland\'s new single game points record. [ 42 ] With averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game to finish the season, he became the youngest player in league history to be named to an All-NBA Team , being selected to the All-NBA Second Team. [ 10 ] Despite a 30\xe2\x80\x9320 record to start the year, [ 42 ] Cleveland again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the year with a 42\xe2\x80\x9340 record. [ 43 ] \n 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season \n At the 2006 NBA All-Star Game , James led the East to victory with a 29 point, 6 rebound, 2 assist performance, and became the youngest ever winner of the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award at 21 years, 51 days. [ 44 ] For the 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season , he averaged 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 30 points per game. [ 37 ]  [ 45 ] He was considered a strong candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award , but eventually finished second in the voting to Steve Nash ; however, he was awarded co-MVP honors with Nash by The Sporting News , [ 46 ] and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. [ 47 ] \n Under James\' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998, [ 48 ] improving their record by 33 wins from three years prior. [ 49 ] In his playoff debut, he recorded a triple-double with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards . [ 50 ] He joined Johnny McCarthy and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to register a triple-double in their playoff debut. [ 50 ] For the series, James averaged 35.7 points per game and Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games. [ 51 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers were ousted by the defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons . [ 52 ] James\' final playoff averages were 30.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game. [ 37 ] \n After the playoffs, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60&#160;million contract extension with a player option for a fourth year. [ 53 ] Although it was for fewer years and less money than the maximum he could sign, it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season . [ 53 ] He discussed this decision with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh , fellow members of his 2003 draft class, who also re-signed with their respective teams while allowing them to be unrestricted agents in 2010. [ 54 ] \n 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames at the free throw line in April 2007. \n \n \n In the 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season , James averaged 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. [ 10 ]  [ 55 ] The Cavaliers finished the year with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed. [ 56 ] In the first round, Cleveland defeated the Wizards for the second straight season, sweeping them in four games. [ 57 ] For the series, James averaged 27.8 points, 7.5 assists, and 8.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] In the second round, James averaged 25.0 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.6 assists per game, leading the Cavaliers past the Nets in six games. [ 58 ]  [ 58 ] In the Eastern Conference Finals, Cleveland faced the Pistons in a rematch from the year before. [ 59 ] In Game 5, James notched a playoff franchise record 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, and scored 29 of the Cavaliers\' last 30 points including the game-winning lay-up with two seconds left. [ 60 ] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator Steve Kerr called it "Jordan-esque." [ 61 ] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in NBA playoff history. [ 62 ] Cleveland won the series to advance to the Finals versus San Antonio , losing in four games. [ 59 ] For the postseason, James averaged 25.1 points, 8.0 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game, although his Finals averages dropped to 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. [ 10 ]  [ 37 ] \n 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season \n During the 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season , James was named the All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27 point, 8 rebound, 9 assist, 2 block, and 2 steal performance. [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] On February 27, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 10,000 career points at 23 years, 59 days in a game against the Boston Celtics . [ 65 ] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty. [ 66 ]  [ 66 ] With seven triple-doubles to finish the year, James set a new personal and team record for triple-doubles in a season. [ 67 ] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title . [ 68 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008. \n \n \n Despite James\' individual accomplishments, Cleveland\'s record fell from the year before to 45\xe2\x80\x9337. [ 69 ] Seeded fourth in the Eastern Conference entering the playoffs , the Cavaliers were matched up with the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season. [ 70 ] In a pre-series interview, Washington guard DeShawn Stevenson stirred up controversy when he called James "overrated". [ 71 ] James answered by saying that responding to Stevenson would be like rap icon Jay-Z feuding with one-hit wonder Soulja Boy . [ 71 ] In the series, Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games before being eliminated in seven games by the Celtics in the next round. [ 72 ] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a "shootout". [ 73 ] \n 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames defends Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics in October 2008. \n \n \n In the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season , James finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first All-Defensive Team behind 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. [ 74 ]  [ 75 ] He also became the fourth player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories (total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) in one season. [ 76 ] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star Mo Williams , the Cavaliers went a franchise record 66\xe2\x80\x9316 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history. [ 77 ] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and a career-high 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the NBA MVP Award. [ 78 ]  [ 79 ]  [ 80 ] \n In the playoffs , Cleveland swept the Pistons in the first round. [ 81 ] At the end of Game 4, Detroit\'s home crowd started an MVP chant for James, who registered 36 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 assists that night. [ 82 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers swept the Atlanta Hawks . [ 83 ] In the Conference Finals, Cleveland were matched up with the Orlando Magic . [ 81 ] In Game 1, James scored 49 points with a 66 percent shooting rate in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. [ 62 ] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 84 ] The Cavaliers would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. [ 85 ] James later told reporters: "It\'s hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them, I\'m a winner. It\'s not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody beats you up, you\'re not going to congratulate them. ... I\'m a competitor. That\'s what I do. It doesn\'t make sense for me to go over and shake somebody\'s hand." [ 86 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attacks the basket in April 2009. \n \n \n 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season \n To address their lack of an inside presence against Orlando, the Cavaliers traded for center Shaquille O\'Neal before the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season. [ 87 ] To give James more scoring help, Cleveland also added All-Star Antawn Jamison to their roster at the trading deadline. [ 88 ] On March 13, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 15,000 career points at 25 years, 79 days during a game against the Chicago Bulls . [ 89 ] At the end of the season, he was named NBA MVP for the second consecutive year with averages of 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, a career-high 8.6 assists, 1 block, and 1.6 steals per game on 50 percent shooting. [ 90 ] The Cavaliers also finished the regular season with the league\'s best record for the second straight year. [ 91 ] \n In the playoffs , the Cavaliers beat the Chicago Bulls in the first round but fell to the Celtics in the second round. [ 92 ] James was heavily criticized for not playing well, particularly in Game 5 of the series when he shot only 20 percent on 14 shots, scoring 15 points. [ 93 ] At the conclusion of the game he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland\'s home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever. [ 94 ] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists, but on just 38 percent shooting with 9 turnovers. [ 92 ] \n 2010 free agency \n \n \n \n  \nJames takes a free throw against the Atlanta Hawks in April 2010. \n \n \n Main article: The Decision (TV special) \n James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01&#160;am EDT on July 1, 2010. [ 95 ] During his free agency he was courted by several teams including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers , Miami Heat , Knicks, New Jersey Nets , and Cavaliers. [ 96 ] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat. [ 97 ] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut , raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities. [ 98 ]  [ 99 ] The day before the special, fellow free agents Bosh and Wade had also announced they would sign with Miami. [ 100 ]  [ 101 ] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. [ 102 ]  [ 103 ] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. [ 104 ] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson . [ 102 ]  [ 105 ] \n James drew immense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James\' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. [ 106 ] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James\' actions. [ 107 ] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. [ 108 ] Former NBA players including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as "the guy". [ 109 ]  [ 110 ]  [ 111 ] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision . [ 112 ]  [ 113 ] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America\'s most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior. [ 114 ]  [ 115 ] The phrase "taking my talents to South Beach" became a punch line for critics. [ 116 ]  [ 117 ] \n Immediately following The Decision , James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. [ 118 ] Since then, he has expressed remorse over his actions. During the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season, he said he "probably would do it a little bit different ... But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my decision." [ 119 ] James relented about the special before the 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season: "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." [ 115 ] \n Miami Heat (2010\xe2\x80\x93present) \n Signing \n James officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, completing a sign-and-trade six-year contract with the team. [ 120 ] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982 . [ 121 ] Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the collective bargaining agreement , he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support. [ 122 ] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new "big three" at the American Airlines Arena , an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. [ 123 ] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. [ 124 ]  [ 125 ] Outside of Miami the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James. [ 126 ]  [ 127 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Miami Heat . \n \n \n 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season \n Throughout the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season , James embraced the villain role bestowed upon him by the media. He later said that the negativity surrounding him as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period "basically turned me into somebody I wasn\'t ... You start to hear \'the villain,\' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I\'ve never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that\'s mentally. That\'s not the way I play the game of basketball." [ 128 ] He often played the point guard role that Riley sold to him during free agency, and in an early season victory versus the Minnesota Timberwolves , he was Miami\'s primary ball handler and registered a game-high 12 assists, the most ever by a Heat forward. [ 129 ]  [ 130 ]  [ 131 ]  [ 132 ]  [ 129 ] On December 2, he returned to Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. [ 133 ]  [ 134 ] He finished his debut season on the Heat with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game on 51 percent shooting. [ 47 ] \n Entering the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and the Celtics in the second round. [ 135 ] In the Conference Finals, Miami met the first-seeded Bulls, winning in five games. [ 135 ] In the 2011 NBA Finals , Miami stumbled against the Dallas Mavericks , losing in six games despite holding a 2\xe2\x80\x931 series lead going into Game 4. [ 135 ] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only 3 points in fourth quarters in the series. [ 136 ] His scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the lowest such drop-off in league history. [ 137 ] \n 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season \n Humbled by Miami\'s loss to Dallas, James spent the offseason attempting to improve himself as a basketball player and a person, and worked with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] The Heat opened the lockout-shortened 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season on a strong note, finishing January with a 16\xe2\x80\x935 record and matching their best start to a season in franchise history. [ 140 ] In the 2012 All-Star Game , James tied Kevin Durant with a game-high 36 points and tied the All-Star Game record of six three-pointers made. [ 141 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named league MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting. [ 142 ] \n The Heat entered the playoffs with the second seed in the Eastern Conference. [ 143 ] They defeated the Knicks in five games in the first round before falling behind 2\xe2\x80\x931 to Indiana in the second round. [ 143 ] In Game 4, James turned in one of the best all-around performances of his career, registering 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists in a winning effort on the road. [ 144 ] Miami eventually won the series in six games. [ 143 ] In the Conference Finals, the Heat again faced the Celtics , winning the first two games before dropping the next three. [ 143 ] Facing elimination, James lead Miami to victory by scoring 45 points in Game 6, making 19 of 26 shot attempts for a 73 percent shooting rate. [ 145 ] He also contributed 15 rebounds and 5 assists, becoming the second player in league history to do so besides Wilt Chamberlain for the San Francisco Warriors in 1964 . [ 146 ] The Heat won Game 7 to advance to the 2012 NBA Finals . [ 143 ] \n In the Finals, the Heat were matched up with the Oklahoma City Thunder . [ 143 ] Despite holding a 13-point first half lead in Game 1, Miami lost the first game of the series. [ 147 ] In Game 2, the Heat again built a double-digit lead, this time holding on and winning to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 148 ] Back in Miami, the Heat took Game 3 to go up 2\xe2\x80\x931. [ 149 ] Game 4 proved to be a memorable one for James. With five minutes left in the game, he started experiencing leg cramps and was carried off the floor. He returned soon after and hit a three-pointer with 2:51 left to give Miami a three point lead they did not relinquish. [ 150 ] In Game 5, James registered his only triple-double of the season with 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second ever championship and James\' first championship. [ 151 ] James was unanimously voted the NBA Finals MVP with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. [ 152 ] His final playoff averages were 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. [ 153 ] \n 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season \n On January 16 of the 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season , James became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points at 28 years, 17 days during a game against the Golden State Warriors . [ 154 ] In February, he had a "month for the ages". [ 155 ] To start the month, he became the first player in league history to score at least 30 points and shoot at least 60 percent in six straight games. [ 156 ] He finished the month having made 139 of 217 field goals, becoming the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in March 1983 to take more than 200 shots in a calendar month and make at least 64 percent of them. [ 157 ] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the second longest in league history . [ 158 ] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66-16 record. [ 159 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named the NBA Most Valuable Player for the fourth time, after averaging 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting. He received 120 out of 121 first-place votes, one shy of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. He also finished second in voting for the Defensive Player of the Year award, which he expressed interest in winning. [ 160 ] \n International career \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a shot over China\'s Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. \n \n \n James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece . [ 161 ] U.S. Olympic coach Larry Brown said that James, accustomed to being a star, was not 100% receptive to a reduced role. [ 162 ] James spent the Olympics mostly on the bench without quality playing time, [ 163 ]  [ 164 ] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. [ 161 ] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up. [ 161 ]  [ 165 ] James felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play". [ 166 ] His attitude during the Olympics was described as "disrespectful" and "distasteful" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey , respectively. [ 167 ]  [ 168 ] \n At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan , James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. [ 169 ]  [ 170 ] The team finished the tournament with an 8\xe2\x80\x931 record, winning another bronze medal. [ 169 ] James\' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen , who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members. [ 167 ]  [ 171 ] \n Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team , Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. [ 167 ]  [ 172 ] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007 , he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. [ 173 ]  [ 174 ] Team USA went 10\xe2\x80\x930, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China . [ 161 ] James credited the team\'s attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: "I don\'t think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now." [ 164 ] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000 . [ 175 ] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain. [ 175 ] \n James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England . [ 176 ]  [ 177 ] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant , who would soon be 34, stepping back. [ 178 ]  [ 179 ]  [ 180 ] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. [ 112 ]  [ 181 ]  [ 182 ]  [ 183 ] During the Games, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history. [ a ] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. [ 185 ] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men\'s basketball history. [ 161 ]  [ 185 ] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. [ 186 ] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now." [ 187 ] \n Player profile \n \n \n \n  \nJames drives to the basket in March 2008. \n \n \n Standing at six feet, eight inches tall and weighing in at 250 pounds, James has been called the best physical specimen in sports by some sports analysts. [ 188 ]  [ 189 ] He has started at the small forward and power forward positions, but can also play and guard the other three positions. [ 153 ] With career averages of 27.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game, [ 47 ] he is considered one of the most versatile players in the NBA, [ 190 ] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. [ 37 ]  [ 191 ] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, and All-Defensive honors every season since 2009. [ 47 ] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain , and Bill Russell . [ 192 ] Since 2011, James has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN\'s #NBArank project. [ 193 ]  [ 194 ]  [ 195 ] \n In Cleveland, James was used as an on-ball point forward, and his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented. [ 190 ] He established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in the NBA, leading the league in completed traditional three point plays in various seasons. [ 10 ] He also regularly ranked as one of the league leaders in rebounds for his position. [ 196 ]  [ 197 ] Despite his award-worthy play with the Cavaliers, he was criticized for not developing a reliable jump shot or post game, [ 198 ] areas he improved in Miami, where Heat coach Eric Spoelstra changed James\' role to a more unconventional one. [ 190 ] James began spending more time in the post and shooting less three pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. [ 190 ]  [ 47 ] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat\'s "pass-happy" offense. [ 199 ] \n James\' clutch play has been the subject of much scrutiny throughout his career. He has been repeatedly criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games. [ 200 ]  [ 201 ] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James. [ 202 ] On the other hand, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant. [ 203 ] Additionally, a 2012 feature by ESPN ranked three of James\' playoff performances as some of the greatest in NBA history. [ 62 ] \n Off the court \n Personal life \n James has two children with his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The first, LeBron James Jr., was born on October 6, 2004, [ 204 ] and the second, Bryce Maximus James, on June 14, 2007. [ 62 ]  [ 204 ] They currently reside in Coconut Grove , a Miami suburb, where James bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9&#160;million. [ 205 ] James became engaged to Brinson on December 31, 2011, proposing to her at a party to celebrate New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve and his 27th birthday. [ 206 ] \n Endorsements \n James has endorsement contracts with Nike , Sprite , Glac\xc3\xa9au , Bubblicious , Upper Deck , McDonald\'s , State Farm , Dunkin\' Brands , and Audemars Piguet . [ 207 ]  [ 208 ]  [ 209 ]  [ 210 ] His initial contract with Nike was worth almost $90 million. [ 211 ] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of James\' rights, and as part of the deal, he and his manager Maverick Carter were granted minority stakes in the English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. [ 212 ] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world\'s highest-paid athletes. [ 213 ]  [ 214 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames is a minority stakeholder of Liverpool F.C. \n \n \n Entertainment \n James, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel , co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards . [ 215 ] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd season premiere of Saturday Night Live . [ 216 ] In 2009, he was featured in the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game , which chronicled his high school years. [ 217 ] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage . [ 218 ] \n Public image \n In 2010, James was ranked by Forbes as the second most influential athlete behind Lance Armstrong . [ 219 ] As a member of the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on their world headquarters throughout his tenure with the team. [ 220 ] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees dressed in a Yankees hat. [ 221 ] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision , he has been listed as one of the most disliked athletes. [ 222 ]  [ 223 ] \n A philanthropist, James is an active supporter of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America, Children\'s Defense Fund , and ONEXONE . [ 224 ] He has also established his own charity foundation called the LeBron James Family Foundation, based out of Akron. [ 225 ] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes. [ 226 ] \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n The WWI Destroy This Mad Brute poster, the 1933 King Kong movie poster and the April 2008 Vogue cover with James and Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen which critics said referenced the earlier posters. [ 227 ]  [ 228 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n In March 2008, James became the first black man\xe2\x80\x94and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney \xe2\x80\x94to appear on the cover of Vogue , posing with Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen . [ 229 ] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding B\xc3\xbcndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong , a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest. [ 227 ]  [ 228 ] \n While James has largely avoided political issues, he drew criticism in 2007 when he declined to sign a petition started by his Cavaliers teammate Ira Newble regarding the Chinese government \'s alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan , stating that he did not know enough about the issue. [ 230 ]  [ 231 ] A year later, James did talk publicly about the issue, saying, "At the end of the day we\'re talking about human rights. And people should understand that human rights and people\'s lives are in jeopardy. We\'re not talking about contracts here. We\'re not talking about money. We\'re talking about people\'s lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract." [ 232 ]  [ 233 ] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Barack Obama . [ 234 ] On October 29, 2008, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama\'s 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement. [ 235 ] It was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert. [ 235 ] \n Salaries \n \n All salaries from Basketball Reference.

Does this mean the franchise\'s best player will follow? Mike Brown and LeBron James combined for 272 wins in five seasons together, an average of more than 54 wins per season. Included in this time were 42 playoff wins, two league MVPs, a Coach of the Year award and the Cavs\' only trip to the NBA Finals. All of this success surely means James would be open to reuniting with his old coach, right? Wrong. For all the good times Brown and James enjoyed together in Cleveland, their time together with the Cavs is over and done with. On the surface, Brown and James seemed like a good fit. After all, who can argue with all those wins? James could seemingly do whatever he wanted on Brown\'s team. We saw the handshakes, the camera poses and of course, the sideline dancing. \n\t \n\t All of this was well and good&mdash;the Cavs were winning and everybody was putting up a happy front. Behind the scenes, though, a lack of discipline, leadership and accountability leaked throughout Quicken Loans Arena. James had become such a rock star that he felt he didn\'t need to listen to Brown&mdash;someone who had never even played in the NBA. Sure, he\'d pick up a few things here and there, but would never really take Brown seriously. This was obvious during timeouts, where James would often look disinterested and withdrawn when Brown would try to correct one of his on-court mistakes. Cavs\' fans saw this, whether they wanted to or not. James never showed the respect or admiration you look for a player to display when interacting with a head coach. This wasn\'t Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson or Tim Duncan and Gregg Popovich, where the coach\'s background and prestige were enough to make even a star player sit up and listen. \n\t \n\t After James left, one of his former teammates, Shaquille O\'Neal , shared a story on his time with the Cavs in his book "Shaq Uncut: My Story" . The excerpt can be seen here, and reaffirms what many already believed to be going on behind closed doors. \n LeBron was a huge star. He was as big as I was in 2000 in L.A. when I was dominating the league. &hellip; Our coach, Mike Brown, was a nice guy, but he had to live on edge because nobody was supposed to be confrontational with LeBron. Nobody wanted him to leave Cleveland, so he was allowed to do whatever he wanted to do. \n I remember one day in a film session LeBron didn&rsquo;t get back on defense after a missed shot. Mike Brown didn&rsquo;t say anything about it. He went to the next clip and it was Mo Williams not getting back and Mike was saying, &ldquo;Yo, Mo, we can&rsquo;t have that. You&rsquo;ve got to hustle a little more.&rdquo; So Delonte West is sitting there and he&rsquo;s seen enough and he stands up and says, &ldquo;Hold up, now. You can&rsquo;t be pussyfooting around like that. Everyone has to be accountable for what they do, not just some of us.&rdquo; Mike Brown said, &ldquo;I know, Delonte. I know.&rdquo; Mike knew Delonte was right. &hellip; \n To be fair to Brown, LeBron had a strong hold on the franchise as a whole. Even if Brown wanted to get on him more and instill some more discipline, it\'s likely he would have gotten a phone call from Dan Gilbert to not do anything that would make James upset. This is where Brown made his mistake. As a coach, when you challenge a role player or rookie to be better, few others will pay attention. When you challenge the best player on the planet to raise his game, others will certainly know they need to raise their own. Brown never did this, or at least, not enough. A lot of respect can be earned and lost through controversy. If handled correctly, it can truly be a time of growth and development in a player-coach relationship. Brown instead chose to avoid controversy with James, as evidenced by O\'Neal, and thus missed out on these opportunities to build trust and respect. The final chapter of Brown and James\' book ended with a second-round playoff loss to the Boston Celtics , the firing of Brown and ultimately, the departure of James. \n\t \n\t The dismissal of Brown was one final attempt to appease James&mdash;something the franchise had tried to do again and again. Now, three years later, Brown is back with the Cavaliers as their head coach. Back with him are the memories of playoff trips, a Finals appearance and James dancing on the sidelines while Brown looked on, helpless. Their relationship, although it yielded plenty of success, never did reach the ultimate goal. The ultimate goal that James reached last season and could very well reach again this June. \n\t \n\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tRonald Martinez/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t James will not leave Miami and a championship roster to come back to Cleveland and Brown. Even with the allure of playing next to Kyrie Irving, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson, Anderson Varejao and others, James will smile, thank the Cavs for their interest and continue to collect titles under the watchful eye of Pat Riley in South Beach. Brown never earned the trust necessary for LeBron to want to play for him again, and that\'s OK. The Cavs\' dream of James returning, if there ever was one, should now be laid to rest. Instead, Brown must now learn from his mistakes and challenge Irving the way he never did James. He must get in his face, yell, criticize, hold him accountable and do all the things he never did to James the first time around. Irving will become a better player because of it, and will wind up respecting Brown the way James never did. "Brown and James, Act Two " will never be written, and that\'s OK, because " Brown, Irving, Waiters and Thompson, Act One" should be pretty darn good, too. \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\n\t \n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\t\t Flag \n \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Props (0) \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\n\n \n \n \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t \n\n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \n\tThis article is\n\n\t \n\t\t a duplicate \n\t\t offensive \n\t\t plagiarized  \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\n\t What is the duplicate article?

The Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeated the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder , 4\xe2\x80\x931, to win their second NBA title. Miami\'s LeBron James was named the Finals MVP . \n This marked the first time that the Oklahoma City Thunder appeared in the NBA Finals since the franchise\'s relocation from Seattle, Washington in 2008 , and their first Finals appearance overall since 1996 as the Seattle SuperSonics . It also marked the Miami Heat\'s third appearance in the NBA Finals. The Heat previously appeared in 2006 and 2011 , both times against the Dallas Mavericks. \n The series began on June 12, five days later than its originally planned June 7 start. This delay was due to the lockout that pushed the start of the season to late December and shortened the regular season to 66 games. [ 1 ] The series then ended on June 21. Under the 2\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x932 rotation, the Thunder had home-court advantage, since they had a better regular season record than the Heat, and thus hosted the first two games. The Heat also became the first team since the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 Los Angeles Lakers to win the NBA title after losing the previous year, and the first Eastern Conference team to do so since the 1988\xe2\x80\x9389 Detroit Pistons . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Background \n \n 1.1 Miami Heat \n 1.2 Oklahoma City Thunder \n 1.3 Road to the Finals \n 1.4 Regular season series \n \n \n 2 The series \n \n 2.1 Game 1 \n 2.2 Game 2 \n 2.3 Game 3 \n 2.4 Game 4 \n 2.5 Game 5 \n \n \n 3 Statistical leaders \n 4 Rosters \n 5 Broadcast \n 6 References \n 7 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Background \n [ edit ] Miami Heat \n See also: 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 Miami Heat season \n This was the second consecutive appearance for the Heat, after losing to the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 . This was also their second Finals appearance in the "Big Three" era. [ 2 ] Their other Finals appearance was in 2006 when they defeated the Mavericks to win their first NBA title. [ 3 ] \n In the regular season, the Heat finished with 46 victories, then defeated the New York Knicks (4\xe2\x80\x931), Indiana Pacers (4\xe2\x80\x932) and Boston Celtics (4\xe2\x80\x933) on their way to the Finals. Along the way, they managed to overcome series deficits that nearly sent them home but they had strings of victories to let them survive. The first was against the Pacers in the Conference Semifinals when they trailed in the series, 1\xe2\x80\x932. The Heat responded by taking three straight victories to defeat the Pacers. The second was against the Celtics in the Conference Finals when they trailed, 2\xe2\x80\x933, in the series. They responded by winning a decisive game 6 in Boston, taking the last two games of the series to advance to the Finals. [ 4 ] \n The Heat retained much of the same cast from last year, save for Shane Battier, rookies Terrel Harris and Norris Cole , [ 5 ]  Eddy Curry , [ 6 ]  [ 7 ] and Ronny Turiaf , who was a member of the Los Angeles Lakers team that lost in the Finals to the Boston Celtics in 2008 . [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Oklahoma City Thunder \n See also: 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 Oklahoma City Thunder season \n This was the Thunder\'s first NBA Finals appearance since they relocated in 2008 from Seattle . Including their seasons as the Seattle SuperSonics , this was also the club\'s fourth Finals appearance, and first since 1996 , when they lost to the Michael Jordan -led Chicago Bulls . The team was seeking their first NBA championship since 1979 . [ 9 ] \n The Thunder finished with 47 wins, second in the Western Conference.

The Thunder attempted a comeback in fourth quarter, and with 37 seconds left in the game, Oklahoma City\'s Kevin Durant made a three-pointer to cut the deficit, 98\xe2\x80\x9396. After the Heat failed to score on their next possession, Kevin Durant missed a jump shot along the baseline that would have tied the game. LeBron James led the Heat with 32 points.

However, Miami scored the last seven points in the third quarter to regain the lead at 69\xe2\x80\x9367. With 7:36 remaining in the game, the Thunder came back to retake the lead at 77\xe2\x80\x9376, but the Heat then scored eight unanswered points to build an 84\xe2\x80\x9377 advantage with 3:47 left. A 6\xe2\x80\x930 run by Oklahoma City pulled them within one point of Miami with 90 seconds left, but the Thunder could not score again for the rest of the game while the Heat made five insurance free throws.

The Thunder jumped to a 33\xe2\x80\x9319 lead by the end the first quarter, but the Heat rallied to cut the score to 49\xe2\x80\x9346 at halftime, thanks to two huge three-pointers by Heat rookie Norris Cole . The two teams remained neck-and-neck throughout most of the third quarter, with Miami holding a 4-point lead at the start of fourth period. However, for the final 16 minutes of the game, Russell Westbrook (who led the Thunder with 43 points) and Kevin Durant (who had 28 points) were the only two Oklahoma City players able to score. With the other Thunder players struggling to make their shots, Miami was able to pull away in the end, largely thanks to late-game heroics from LeBron James , Mario Chalmers and Dwyane Wade . LeBron James led the Heat with 26 points, including the go ahead three pointer, but had to sit out during the final two minutes of the game due to leg cramps. [ 15 ] Mario Chalmers scored 25 points and made two key plays to seal Miami\'s win: a driving layup around a well-positioned Serge Ibaka and two free throws after a rare mistake by Westbrook (he fouled Chalmers after the point guard recovered Shane Battier\'s tip on a jump ball with less than 1 minute left, thinking that the shot clock would reset, while NBA rules do not reset at that point in a 4th quarter if the team that previously had the ball re-gains possession off the tip). \n [ edit ] Game 5 \n \n \n June 21 \n 9:00&#160;pm \n Recap \n Oklahoma City Thunder 106, Miami Heat 121 \n &#160;&#160; \n American Airlines Arena , Miami, Florida \n Attendance: 20,003 \n Referees: \n \n No. 43 Dan Crawford \n No. 13 Monty McCutchen \n No. 9 Derrick Stafford \n \n \n ABC \n \n \n Scoring by quarter: 26\xe2\x80\x93 31 , 23\xe2\x80\x93 28 , 22\xe2\x80\x93 36 , 35 \xe2\x80\x9326 \n \n \n Pts: Kevin Durant 32 \n Rebs: Kevin Durant 11 \n Asts: Russell Westbrook 6 \n \n Pts: LeBron James 26 \n Rebs: LeBron James 11 \n Asts: LeBron James 13 \n \n \n Miami wins NBA Finals, 4\xe2\x80\x931 \n \n \n Miami won Game 5, 121\xe2\x80\x93106, to win the series, four games to one. [ 16 ] After keeping it a close game in the first half, the Thunder were outscored by 14 in the third quarter, with Miami leading as much as 27 at one point. Miami was fueled by strong performances by LeBron James, Dwayne Wade , and Chris Bosh , as well as by Mike Miller , who was 7 for 8 for three-pointers, ending the night with 23 points. The team tied an NBA Finals record for most 3-pointers in a game with 14. [ 16 ] With three minutes remaining in the game, both teams took their starters out of the game, with the Heat still leading by more than 20 points. With their Game 5 win, the Heat won their second NBA championship in team history, and the first for several Heat players, including James, who was named the NBA Finals MVP after averaging 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists in the finals, capping it all off with his first triple double of the season in the final game. [ 16 ] For the Thunder, Kevin Durant had 32 points, and 11 rebounds; Russell Westbrook had 19 points and 6 assists; and James Harden led the bench with 19 points, 5 assists, and 4 rebounds. [ 16 ] \n The Heat became just the third home team to sweep the middle three games of a Finals series since the NBA switched to the 2\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x932 format in 1985, the other two being their 2006 team and the 2004 Detroit Pistons . They also joined the 2004 Pistons and 1995 Houston Rockets as the only lower seeded team to win the Finals in 5 games or less. In addition, they became the first team to win the NBA Finals after trailing in three different series in the postseason, 1\xe2\x80\x932 against Indiana, 2\xe2\x80\x933 against Boston, and 0\xe2\x80\x931 against Oklahoma City. Dwayne Wade and Udonis Haslem are the only Heat players to win both 2006 and 2012 NBA championships for the Miami Heat, while head coach Erik Spoelstra earned a 2nd ring to go with the one he earned as an assistant for the 2006 team. The Heat\'s second title also made them the first franchise in the NBA\'s Southeast Division with multiple titles (the Atlanta Hawks won the title in 1958 while they were based in St. Louis, and the Washington Wizards won in 1978, while the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Bobcats have not won any NBA titles as of 2013) and they remain the only expansion team in the past 25 years to ever win a title, let alone two (other examples include the Charlotte/New Orleans Hornets and the Minnesota Timberwolves). \n [ edit ] Statistical leaders \n \n \n Category \n High \n Average \n \n \n Player \n Team \n Total \n Player \n Team \n Avg. \n Games played \n \n \n Points \n Russell Westbrook \n Oklahoma City Thunder \n 43 \n Kevin Durant \n Oklahoma City Thunder \n 30.6 \n 5 \n \n \n Rebounds \n Chris Bosh \n Miami Heat \n 15 \n LeBron James \n Miami Heat \n 10.2 \n 5 \n \n \n Assists \n LeBron James \n Miami Heat \n 13 \n LeBron James \n Miami Heat \n 7.4 \n 5 \n \n \n Steals \n LeBron James \n Miami Heat \n 4 \n Mario Chalmers \n Miami Heat \n 1.8 \n 5 \n \n \n Blocks \n Serge Ibaka \n Oklahoma City Thunder \n 5 \n Serge Ibaka \n Oklahoma City Thunder \n 2.0 \n 5 \n \n \n [ edit ] Rosters \n \n \n \n 2012 Miami Heat Finals roster \n \n \n Players \n Coaches \n \n \n \n \n \n Pos. \n # \n Name \n Height \n Weight \n DOB (Y\xe2\x80\x93M\xe2\x80\x93D) \n From \n \n \n 5.5 !

A formal announcement is planned Sunday, the eve of the Eastern Conference semifinals for the Miami Heat. The honor will vault James into an elite category shared by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain, the only other players to win the award at least four times.\n [ - ] \n Impact: James\' other MVPs came in 2009, 2010 and 2012. He joins Russell as the only players to win the award four times in five years and Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to twice win the award in consecutive seasons. After practice Saturday, James said his primary goal remained helping the Heat win a second successive NBA title.  \n Complete fantasy player news > \r\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n LAST &amp; NEXT GAME \n \n DATE \n OPP \n RESULT \n MIN \n PTS \n REB \n ASST \n FG% \n BLK \n STL \n PF \n \n Apr 28 \n MIL \n W 88-77 \n 41 \n 30 \n 8 \n 7 \n .650 \n 1 \n 3 \n 3 \n \n AVERAGES VS.

Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he contemplated going pro. \n Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The team also earned the top national ranking that year. Overall, James scored 2,657 points, 892 rebounds and 523 assists during his four years at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School. He would soon emerge as one of the National Basketball Association\'s leading players. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t Career with Cleveland Cavaliers \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA draft. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. Around this time, James also signed several endorsement deals, including one with Nike for $90 million. \n During the 2003-04 season, James made history, becoming the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. He also became the youngest NBA player (at only 20 years old) to receive this honor. Additionally, James, averaging 20 points per game at this time, became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson .

Like an ordinary fan, he watched the Heat, who had some guy named Jarvis Vernado playing for them. And Miami won without James \xe2\x80\x94 and most of its other stars. James sat on the bench in street clothes as Norris Cole stripped Kyrie Irving of the ball with 2.2 seconds left to give Miami, with coach Erik Spoelstra resting his starters and most of his top players for the playoffs, a 96-95 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night. BOX SCORE: Heat 96, Cavaliers 95 NBA: Five best home-court playoff advantages Cole finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 9 assists. But it was his only steal on Cleveland\'s final possession that sealed one of Miami\'s most unexpected wins this season. "Everbody had a hand in this win," Spoelstra said. "That\'s what we wanted to do. We\'re here. We might as well compete and made the most of it." James was disappointed to not play in another homecoming game against his former team, but he appreciated Spoelstra\'s desire to get the NBA champions as healthy and refreshed as possible heading into the postseason. Chris Bosh and Mario Chalmers joined James on the bench while Dwyane Wade, Shane Battier and Udonis Haslem stayed back in Miami with minor injuries. Rashard Lewis scored 19 points and James Jones had 14 for the Heat Light, and Miami got win 65 \xe2\x80\x94 a number Spoelstra could have imagine. "Sixty-five is a big number," Spoelstra said. "I\'ve been part of championship teams and teams that had great success in this league that have never been able to win this many games." Irving and Tristan Thompson scored 16 apiece for the Cavs, who have lost five straight, 15 of 17 and may soon relieve Byron Scott of his coaching duties. Scott, though, believes he will return for a fourth season. "I am going to be back to coach them," he said. "I\'ve got a year left on my contract, so unless I\'m told different, I expect to do that."   \r\n        LeBron James. What\'s left to say? Four-time MVP. Champion. Gold medalist.

After two timeouts, the Cavs ran an isolation play for Irving, who drove left and tried to spin on Cole but had the ball taken away by the Cleveland State product. As Cole dribbled out the final seconds, James and the rest of the Heat\'s high-paid benchwarmers walked onto the floor to help Miami\'s reserves celebrate. "I wanted to stay between him and the basket," Cole said of the final play. "I had a chance to strip the ball and I did. In situatuions like that the game\'s on the line. You have to buckle up and play the best defense you can." When the game ended, Irving ran off the floor and skipped a postgame ceremony where Cavs players gave away jerseys and game-worn shoes to fans. A team official said Irving was injured, but that seemed to be news to the 21-year-old All-Star. "That\'s what I have?" Irving said sarcastically. "Oh. When was someone going to tell me? I\'m hurt again. How long am I going to be out? James was limited to a pregame workout with Bosh and Chalmers as the Heat played their final road game before finishing the regular season in Orlando on Wednesday. James was officially listed as being out with a "sore right hamstring" but his benching was more to get him set for another possible title run. DRAFT: Cavs could have a few possible targets This was a fairly uneventful game compared to James\' previous visit on March 20, when the Heat overcame a 27-point deficit in the second half to win; a fan wearing a T-shirt asking James to return to Cleveland ran onto the floor; and the giant scoreboard leaked fluid and delayed the opening tip. With James in a brown sport coat and Bosh wearing his Heat warmups, Spoelstra sent out a starting lineup of Cole, Mike Miller, Joel Anthony, Lewis and 40-year-old journeyman Juwan Howard, who made his first NBA start since April 14, 2010. Still, Miami\'s backups were too much for the Cavs. "Look at their roster," Thompson said. "They\'re not scrubs. A lot of these guys are champions and can start on other teams." James warmed up on the Quicken Loans floor, his homecourt for seven years, for more than 30 minutes before heading to the locker room. On his way out, he stopped to sign autographs in the tunnel leading to Miami\'s dressing room as fans leaned over a railing to hand him balls, caps, posters and anything they could. An aluminum railing briefly gave way and nearly toppled fans on top of James. But security guards acted quickly and were able to secure the partition before ordering fans to move back before someone was seriously injured. James said he was disappointed not to play, but supported his coach. "I\'m never sad about sitting," he said, smiling. "I\'m sad about not playing." A third straight losing season for Cleveland is winding down with coach Scott\'s future in jeopardy. Scott is already under contract for next season, but there\'s no guarantee he\'ll be back. Owner Dan Gilbert, who has not commented on Scott\'s status, had a courtside seat for Cleveland\'s last home game. He can\'t be happy with his team missing the playoffs again, and could be forced to change coaches. Scott said this season has worn him down. "I\'m fatigued, mentally, physically, a little bit of everything," he said. "But I still wake up every morning ready for work." The Cavs did show more effort than on Sunday in Philadelphia when Irving scored a career-low 4 points and Scott benched his starters for the fourth quarter.

NBA\'s Most Valuable Player took notice. \n \n\t\r\n \t\r\n\t \r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n \r\n \n \n\tEvery voter except one, that is. \n \n\tThe NBA still does not have a unanimous MVP, though no one has come closer than James did this season. The Miami Heat star was presented with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy for the fourth time in his career on Sunday after collecting 120 of the 121 first-place votes, with Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks picking up the lone remaining top choice. \n \n\t\'\'It was probably a writer out of New York that didn\'t give me that vote,\'\' James said. \'\'And we know the history between the Heat and the Knicks, so I get it.\'\' \n \n\tA panel of 120 sports writers and broadcasters cast ballots in the NBA MVP voting, with a combined online fan vote also being taken into account. \n \n\tShaquille O\'Neal got every first-place vote but one in the 1999-2000 season, when one person cast his ballot for Allen Iverson - who finished seventh that year. This season, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder finished second, well ahead of Anthony, who was third and didn\'t even appear on nine of the ballots cast. James was the only player listed on all 121 ballots; Durant was omitted from two, according to the results released by the NBA. \n \n\tFor months, there really had only been two questions about this season\'s MVP race: When will James get the award, and would the results be unanimous? The first of those answers became known Friday, the other on Sunday, and even as he was on the dais to pick up the award the now-four-time MVP quickly started steering all of his attention back to the goal of helping the Heat win a second straight title. \n \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\t HE GOT GAME(S) \n\t \n\t\tLeBron\'s fourth MVP season was incredible. His best performances . \n \n \n \n \n\tMiami hosts Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Monday night, when NBA Commissioner David Stern will present James with the trophy, largely just for the benefit of giving Heat fans a pregame reason to cheer. \n \n\t\'\'My ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship,\'\' James said. \'\'That\'s what I brought was here for. That\'s why I signed here as a free agent in 2010. It wasn\'t to win MVP trophies. It was to win a championship - and win multiple championships - and that\'s still my No. 1 priority.\'\' \n \n\tJames averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, leading Miami to a league-best 66-16 record while shooting a career-high 56 percent. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four) have as many MVP awards, only Russell won four in a five-year span, and only Abdul-Jabbar went back-to-back twice, like James did with trophies in 2009 and 2010 and now again in 2012 and 2013. \n \n\tSunday\'s ceremony was filled with tributes and even some laughs, like when James\' youngest son Bryce posed for photographers on stage while his father was speaking and older brother LeBron Jr. looked on - and when James\' fiancee, Savannah Brinson, appeared on a congratulatory video and called him \'\'Honeybunny.\'\' \n \n\t\'\'I know you\'re embarrassed when I call you that,\'\' Brinson said. \'\'But whatever.\'\' \n \n\tOver on the far side of the dais, set up on the floor of the Heat home court, James\' teammates roared in hysterics - and Udonis Haslem made sure James knew that they were talking about Brinson\'s pet name for her future husband. The 14 other Heat players were dressed casually in team garb, while James donned a dapper suit for the festivities. \n \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t \n\t\tLATEST ON HEAT \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t LeBron wins MVP, not unanimously \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Will LeBron break Kareem\'s mark? \n\t\t \n\t\t\t LeBron donates $1M to high school \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Riley: Keeping Big 3 is \'doable\' \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Schedule | Stats | Team page \n\t \n \n \n \n \n\tAs he did on Saturday, a day after it became widely known that the award would be his again, James thanked his teammates. \n \n\t\'\'I\'d rather be sitting over there in shorts and a T-shirt, wondering what the hell they\'re joking about, because I want to be a part of that joke,\'\' James said. \'\'And I hate being out of all the jokes. I want to know what was happening, OK, guys? I would much rather be with my guys over there because that\'s what it\'s all about. Without those guys, this trophy is not possible.\'\' \n \n\tMuch of the ceremony was tinged with emotion. \n \n\tBrinson\'s mother dabbed tears away from her eyes when James thanked his soon-to-be in-laws for what they do for his family. Dwyane Wade (who was 10th in the voting) spoke in a hushed tone on the video, with soft music playing in the background as he told James to \'\'continue to lead this team because we believe in you, so congratulations, Mr. MVP.\'\' James seemed genuinely touched when dozens of students who are part of his \'\'I Promise\'\' educational program chanted for him when the proceedings were complete. \n \n\t\'\'And all the ones that I\'ve observed and I\'ve watched and I\'ve seen, somewhere they\'ve always gotten better,\'\' said Heat President Pat Riley, talking about all the game\'s stars that he\'s witnessed in his 46 NBA years. \'\'They always got better as their career advanced. And most importantly, they\'ve always made their teammates and their team better. In my humble opinion ... I think the man that we\'re looking at right here is the best of all of them.\'\' \n \n\tJames was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in scoring, rebounding and assists per game this season, had a record six straight games of scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent, became the youngest player in league history to break the 20,000-career-point plateau and won five of the six Eastern Conference player of the month awards. \n \n\t \n\t \n\t  \n\t \n\t\t WHO SETS THE CURVE? \n\tCheck out the FOXiest NBA fans and tweet us your photo . \n \n \n \n\tJames has also became the second player in NBA history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, joining Larry Bird, who did it three times. The only other player to do it once was Jordan. \n \n\t\'\'Four now,\'\' Heat managing general partner Micky Arison said. \'\'And more to come.\'\' \n \n \n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t Tweet \r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t   \r\n\t\t\t\t   Tagged: Thunder , Heat , LeBron James , Knicks   \r\n     \r\n\t\t\t   \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Related Stories \r\n\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t Leonard emerging as Spurs newest star \r\n\t\t\t Durant, Thunder edge Grizzlies 93-91 in Game 1 \r\n\t\t\t Kareem Abdul-Jabbar thinks LeBron James can break record \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t \r\n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t \t \r\n\t\t\t \n  \n  \n\n \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \n  \n  \n\n \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\n\t \n\t Member Comments \n \t  \n \t Please note by clicking on "Post comment" you acknowledge that you have read the Terms of Use and the comment you are posting is in compliance with such terms.

It has reached the point this postseason where the complete, healthy and whole, playoff team is the exception, the Miami Heat with their own concerns with Dwyane Wade \'s balky right knee. \r\n While many of the injuries are nothing more than happenstance, body turning one way, limb going the other, the NBA like the NFL is becoming a league of attrition. \r\n When it comes to the schedule, James said this is a case where less-is-more might have its merits. \r\n Teammate Shane Battier was among the first to express that line of thought. \r\n "I think 60 is the perfect number," Battier said this past week. "I\'ve said that for many years. It\'s a long season." \r\n  James picked up from there. \r\n  "It\'s tough and it\'s a lot of wear and tear on our bodies," he said. "An 82-game season is a lot. I\'m not one to say we should have fewer games than we have. But 82 games, with the traveling we had, going to China before the season, it\'s been a lot on us." \r\n The counter from management is that fewer games would require a commensurate drop in salaries. \r\n "I think that\'s a conversation to be had with the players\' association, the players and the owners," James said. "I love to play basketball. We always get the opportunity to go out every night and showcase our talent, but I think that\'s a business question to go over. It benefits some people, some people it doesn\'t benefit." \r\n Teammate James Jones , secretary/treasurer on the union board, said there is another option, one that would include seldom-used players such as himself: teams actually using their entire 15-player rosters, instead of wearing down their stars through the 82-game regular-season grind. \r\n "Our rosters stand at 15, so teams have an option of carrying 15 guys," he said. "What you\'re seeing is just unfortunate. It\'s a string of injuries. It\'s kind of an anomaly. It\'s not something that happens regularly. But I think teams and players and coaches should be more conscious of managing guys\' minutes and using their full roster." \r\n  That\'s not to say that if Heat coach Erik Spoelstra had used Jones, Mike Miller and Rashard Lewis more often that it would have saved Wade from aggravating those knee bruises. But it might have. \r\n Jones said the 2013 playoffs ultimately might be a teaching point. \r\n  "I think you\'ll see fewer and fewer teams having a rotation-heavy and top-dominant rotation, where they only go eight, nine guys," Jones said, an approach that clearly would enhance his own role. "I think you\'ll start to see teams go 11, 12, possibly 13 [deep]. Because that\'s the only way, if you\'re seriously going to contend deep into the playoffs, that\'s the only way you\'ll be able to have guys fresh at the end." \r\n  To ignore the fact that these playoffs are not offering a maximum star-appeal payoff, Battier said, would be a disservice to the game. \r\n  "The bottom line is there are occupational hazards associated with this job," he said. "And being worn down and physically beaten down make you more susceptible to injuries, no question. But that\'s what we signed up for. And you feel bad for the fans. We\'re getting compensated. We\'re OK. We understand what the deal is, and we\'re getting compensated for that risk. But you look at a city like Chicago and Derrick Rose, or David Lee with Golden State , and it\'s a letdown for the fans." \r\n IN THE LANE \r\n  BUMBLING BUCKS: In the wake of being swept in the first round by the Heat, the Milwaukee Bucks said the greater disappointment was settling for the No. 8 Eastern Conference seed. "We basically dog-trotted down the stretch for March and April," forward Mike Dunleavy Jr. told the Journal-Sentinel. "We should have never been in the position of having to play the one-seed. Kind of shame on us. That\'s the disappointing part of the whole season." Said teammate Ersan Ilyasova , "We secured that [playoff] spot and everybody started thinking about what we were going to do in the playoffs." \r\n  SOLID FOOTING: Granted, the Heat and San Antonio Spurs probably would have breezed through their opening-round sweeps anyway, considering their opponents. But it was curious that the two teams that placed the greatest priority on regular-season rest for their stars also made the quickest work of the opening round. That doesn\'t mean Commissioner David Stern still doesn\'t have reservations with the approach. "I think we\'re going to have to come to grips, somehow, with the issue of resting players," Stern said at an Associated Press Sports Editors symposium of commissioners. "We have to recognize both sides of that issue, in terms of not telling a coach how to manage his lineup while at the same time trying to deliver to our fans what they\'ve come to expect. Historically, when you\'re resting a 36-year-old player or a player with a history of injuries, that\'s fine. But when that player gets to be 26 and it\'s a wholesale sort of an elimination of rosters for a game, that\'s less about resting and more about something else going on." \r\n  TRUE TEST: For as surprising as DeQuan Jones\' rise to the NBA was, making the Orlando Magic roster after going undrafted out of the University of Miami a year ago, the next hurdle comes by the Magic\'s June 30 deadline to tender him a qualifying offer. The Magic\'s options are to extend that offer of $990,000, which would allow them to match outside offers in free agency, or to allow Jones to walk as an unrestricted free agent. Because the $990,000 offer would become automatically guaranteed, the greater likelihood is Jones will once again have to try to earn a roster spot through summer-league play, with the Orlando hosting one of the NBA\'s two summer leagues, the other in Las Vegas. \r\n  ON DECK: With former Heat coach Alvin Gentry confirmed for a Thursday interview for the Charlotte Bobcats \' coaching vacancy, the Gaston Gazette pointed out two factors that Gentry might have in his favor for the job with the Michael Jordan -owned team: Gentry\'s cousin David Thompson presented Jordan for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009, and Gentry was a counselor at Jordan\'s adult fantasy camp in Las Vegas in 2010. Speaking of coaching vacancies and Heat ties, with Phil Jackson advising the Detroit Pistons in their coaching search, former Heat guard Brian Shaw , an Indiana Pacers assistant, would have to be considered a frontrunner there. \r\n NUMBER \r\n  3. Times LeBron James has been on a team that swept a best-of-seven playoff series with each win by double figures, as the Heat did in the first round against the Bucks. It has been done six times overall in NBA history. James also did it with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first two rounds in 2009. \r\n  iwinderman@tribune.com.

Miami just needs to wear them down with their depth. They are exhausted and injured.

Noah didn\'t play but they had everyone else healthy. Birdman needs to dominate the Bulls 2nd unit bigs. Taj Gibson is really their only decent big off the bench. \r\n    \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n\t\t\r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\n\n\n\n       \n     \n      \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n       \n     \n     \n      \n     \n   \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n   \n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n\t \n\t \n  \n  \n \t \n \t\t \n    \n     \n    \n    \n    \n\t\t \n  \n\t\n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n \t \n   \n  \n \n\t NBA HIGHLIGHTS \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n  \n \n\n\t\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \t \n \n \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n   \n\n   \n\n   \n     \n        \n     \n   \n   \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n   \n\n  \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n   \t\t\n    \n    \n   \t\t\n \t \n   \n \n \n\n\n\n\n   \n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n     \n     \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n  \n  \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n     \n   \t  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t      Famous South Florida sports mustaches \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n      \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n     \n   \t  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t      Past NBA MVPs since 1990 \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n      \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n     \n   \t  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t      Warren Sapp through the years \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n      \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n     \n   \t  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t      Tim Tebow through the years \n\t\t\t\t\t\t        \n      \n      \n     \n     \n     \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n     \n   \t  \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n      Ira Winderman answers your NBA questions \n\t\t\t\t\t  \n      \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t       ASK IRA: Could Bulls challenge Heat in second round?

They began playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1970. This list summarizes the team\'s season-by-season records, including post-season, and includes select season-end awards won by the team\'s players and/or coaches. The Cavaliers were founded in 1970 as an expansion franchise and since their first season, they have always played in the Central Division and in the Eastern Conference . [ 1 ] \n On October 14, 1970, the Cavs lost to the Buffalo Braves 92-107 in their first game. [ 2 ] They have been awarded the first overall draft pick four times, choosing Austin Carr in 1971 , Brad Daugherty in 1986 , LeBron James in 2003 and Kyrie Irving in 2011 . [ 3 ] In his last season with the Cavs, Carr won the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award , the only Cavalier to ever win the award. [ 4 ] As a Cavalier, LeBron won Rookie of the Year as well as two MVP awards and two All Star Game MVP awards . [ 5 ] Cleveland\'s most recent first overall pick, Kyrie Irving, won Rookie of the Year in 2011. [ 6 ] \n In their 43 seasons, the Cavs have achieved a winning record 19 times. Highlights include 18 playoff appearances and four Eastern Conference Finals appearances, which included winning the Central Division championship three times ( 1976\xe2\x80\x9377 , 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 and 2009-10 ), the Eastern Conference championship once ( 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 ), and a single appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 when they lost to the San Antonio Spurs . [ 1 ]  [ 7 ] Overall, their winning percentage through the years is .456, with 1655 wins and 1971 losses. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Key \n 2 Seasons \n \n 2.1 All-time records \n \n \n 3 Notes \n 4 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Key \n \n \n \n  \n LeBron James won Rookie of the Year, two MVPs and two All Star Game MVPs as a Cavalier. \n \n \n \n \n AMVP \n All-Star Game Most Valuable Player \n \n \n COY \n Coach of the Year \n \n \n Finish \n Final position in league or division standings \n \n \n (No.) \n Number of games the coach coached \n \n \n Italics \n Season in progress \n \n \n Losses \n Number of regular season losses \n \n \n EOY \n Executive of the Year \n \n \n MVP \n Most Valuable Player \n \n \n ROY \n Rookie of the Year \n \n \n SPOR \n Sportsmanship Award \n \n \n JWKC \n J.

It was broadcasted live on ESPN on July 8, 2010. James was an unrestricted free agent after playing seven seasons for the Cleveland Cavaliers , where he was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and a six-time NBA All-Star . James grew up in nearby Akron, Ohio , where he received national attention as a high school basketball star. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Background \n 2 Announcement \n 3 Critical reception \n 4 Aftermath \n 5 See also \n 6 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Background \n James was born and raised in Akron, Ohio , where he received national attention as a high school basketball star at St. Vincent \xe2\x80\x93 St. Mary High School . [ 1 ] He was drafted out of high school by his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA Draft . He played the first seven seasons of his professional career in Cleveland, where he was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player and a six-time NBA All-Star . James became an unrestricted free-agent at 12:01&#160;am EDT on July 1, 2010. [ 2 ] He filed papers to formally change his jersey number 23 to 6 for the season. [ 3 ] James was courted by several teams, including the New York Knicks , Chicago Bulls , New Jersey Nets , Miami Heat , Los Angeles Clippers , and the Cavaliers. [ 4 ] \n Freelance sportscaster Jim Gray pitched the idea to James\' management and ESPN for an hour-long show in which James would announce his decision. Gray once worked for ESPN, and James\' management team insisted that Gray be involved in the interview. ESPN gave away the airtime, allowing James\' team to sell ads, in exchange for the news story. CNBC reported that James\' team paid Gray for his participation in the interview. [ 5 ] \n [ edit ] Announcement \n On July 8, 2010, ESPN aired a live special named The Decision that ran 75 minutes. [ 6 ]  [ 5 ] At 9:28 p.m EDT, James announced that he would play with the Heat in the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season , teaming with Miami\'s other All-Star free agent signees Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh . [ 7 ] \n \n In this fall...this is very tough...in this fall I\'m going to take my talents to South Beach and join the Miami Heat. I feel like it\'s going to give me the best opportunity to win and to win for multiple years, and not only just to win in the regular season or just to win five games in a row or three games in a row, I want to be able to win championships. And I feel like I can compete down there. [ 6 ]  [ 8 ] \n \xe2\x80\x94LeBron James \n \n The announcement, which was not made until nearly 30 minutes into the program, was part of a conversation between James and Gray. [ 8 ] Broadcasted from the Boys and Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut , the show raised $2.5 million for the charity. [ 9 ] The show raised an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue which was donated to other various charities. [ 9 ] \n Wade had informed Heat President Pat Riley that James wanted to become less of a scorer and more of a distributor, and James looked forward to no longer carrying the offense night after night as he did playing with Cleveland. [ 10 ] Riley sold to James that "LeBron would be Magic Johnson , Dwyane Wade would be Kobe Bryant , Chris would be Kevin Garnett ." Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson . [ 10 ]  [ 11 ] \n The Cavaliers were informed of James\' decision minutes before the show began. [ 12 ] \n [ edit ] Critical reception \n The television program drew high ratings, with Nielsen announcing that an average of 9.948 million people watched the show in the United States, with 13.1 million watching at the time of James\' announcement. Cleveland topped all markets with a 26.0 Nielsen rating and 39 share . [ 5 ]  [ 13 ] The show\'s Nielsen ratings were 6.1 in households, and 4.1 in 18-49, making it the most watched cable show of the night. [ 14 ] \n The show drew criticism for the prolonged wait until James\' actual decision and the spectacle of the show itself. [ 5 ] The phrase "taking my talents to South Beach" became a punch line for critics. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] \n In Cleveland, fans considered James\' departure a betrayal that ranks second to The Move , Art Modell \'s relocation of the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore. [ 17 ]  Associated Press wrote that The Decision joined The Move, The Drive , The Shot , and The Fumble in "Cleveland\'s sports hall of shame". [ 7 ] Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert almost immediately published an open letter to fans on the Cav\'s website in Comic sans font, denouncing James\' decision as a "selfish", "heartless", "callous", and "cowardly betrayal", while guaranteeing that the Cavs would win an NBA title before the "self-declared former King." [ 18 ] Gilbert\'s sports-memorabilia company Fathead also lowered the price of wall graphics depicting James from $99.99 to $17.41 , the birth year of Benedict Arnold . [ 19 ]  William Rhoden of The New York Times defended James by stating that Gilbert\'s "venomous, face-saving personal attack", along with the ensuing "wrath of jersey-burning fans", only validated James\xe2\x80\x99 decision to leave Cleveland. [ 20 ]  Reverend Jesse Jackson , American civil rights activist, said Gilbert\'s feelings "personify a slave master mentality", and he was treating James as "a runaway slave". [ 21 ]  J. A. Adande of ESPN said, however, that James chose to promote the drama of his decision in an hour-long television special instead of showing "common courtesy" to notify Cleveland and other teams of his plans. [ 22 ] On July 12, 2010, NBA Commissioner David Stern fined Gilbert $100,000 for the letter\'s contents, while also criticizing the way James handled free agency. [ 23 ] On July 14, James told J. R. Moehringer for a GQ article that there was "nothing at all" he would change about his handling of free agency. [ 24 ] \n Former NBA players criticized his decision to not stay with Cleveland and continuing to try to win a championship as "the guy". [ 25 ]  Michael Jordan stated that he would not have contacted his rivals from other teams like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird to play on one team together, as "I wanted to defeat those guys." Jordan added that "...things are different [now]. I can\'t say that\'s a bad thing. It\'s an opportunity these kids have today." [ 26 ] Johnson echoed Jordan\'s sentiments on teaming with rivals. [ 27 ] \n On September 29, 2010, asked by Soledad O\'Brien of CNN if race was a factor in the fallout from The Decision , James said, "I think so, at times. There\'s always&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 you know, a race factor." [ 28 ] James had previously stayed clear of racial issues. [ 29 ]  [ 30 ] When an earlier racial controversy over his cover on Vogue became a national debate, James had no comment. [ 30 ] Two African American sports columnists criticized James for injecting race into the issue\xe2\x80\x94 Mike Freeman of CBSSports.com said James suddenly bringing up race in this instance was "laughable", [ 30 ] and Jason Whitlock of Foxsports.com said James\' usage of the race card was "an excuse to avoid dealing with his own bad (The) Decision." [ 31 ] Adande, also an African American, had a different view, saying James "didn\'t claim to be a victim of racial persecution" and "caused us to examine the bias that\'s always lurking". [ 29 ] \n [ edit ] Aftermath \n Before a game against the Nets on October 31, 2010, his first game against one of his suitors, James reflected on his free agency: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to go back on it, I probably would do it a little bit different,\xe2\x80\x9d James said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my decision.\xe2\x80\x9d He declined to be more specific. [ 32 ] James relented about the TV special before the 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season: "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." [ 33 ] James won his first NBA championship in 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 , his second season with the Heat. [ 34 ] \n The Cavaliers finished their 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season with a 19\xe2\x80\x9363 record, including an NBA record 26-game losing streak. They won the NBA Draft Lottery and used the first overall pick in the 2011 draft to select Kyrie Irving , the 2012 NBA Rookie of the Year .

Every voter except one, that is. The NBA still does not have a unanimous MVP, though no one has come closer than James did this season. The Miami Heat star was presented with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy for the fourth time in his career on Sunday after collecting 120 of the 121 first-place votes, with Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks picking up the lone remaining top choice. "It was probably a writer out of New York that didn\'t give me that vote," James said. "And we know the history between the Heat and the Knicks, so I get it." A panel of 120 sports writers and broadcasters cast ballots in the NBA MVP voting, with a combined online fan vote also being taken into account. Shaquille O\'Neal got every first-place vote but one in the 1999-2000 season, when one person cast his ballot for Allen Iverson - who finished seventh that year. This season, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder finished second, well ahead of Anthony, who was third and didn\'t even appear on nine of the ballots cast. James was the only player listed on all 121 ballots; Durant was omitted from two, according to the results released by the NBA. "Congrats to the king," O\'Neal wrote on his Twitter account. For months, there really had only been two questions about this season\'s MVP race: When will James get the award, and would the results be unanimous? The first of those answers became known Friday, the other on Sunday, and even as he was on the dais to pick up the award the now-four-time MVP quickly started steering all of his attention back to the goal of helping the Heat win a second straight title. Miami hosts Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Monday night, when NBA Commissioner David Stern will present James with the trophy, largely just for the benefit of giving Heat fans a pregame reason to cheer. "My ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship," James said. "That\'s what I was brought here for. That\'s why I signed here as a free agent in 2010. It wasn\'t to win MVP trophies. It was to win a championship - and win multiple championships - and that\'s still my No. 1 priority." James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, leading Miami to a league-best 66-16 record while shooting a career-high 56 percent. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four) have as many MVP awards, only Russell won four in a five-year span, and only Abdul-Jabbar went back-to-back twice, like James did with trophies in 2009 and 2010 and now again in 2012 and 2013. Sunday\'s ceremony was filled with tributes and even some laughs, like when James\' younger son Bryce posed for photographers on stage while his father was speaking and older brother LeBron Jr. looked on - and when James\' fiancee, Savannah Brinson, appeared on a congratulatory video and called him "Honeybunny." "I know you\'re embarrassed when I call you that," Brinson said. "But whatever." Over on the far side of the dais, set up on the floor of the Heat home court, James\' teammates roared in hysterics - and Udonis Haslem made sure James knew that they were talking about Brinson\'s pet name for her future husband. The 14 other Heat players were dressed casually in team garb, while James donned a dapper suit for the festivities. As he did on Saturday, a day after it became widely known that the award would be his again, James thanked his teammates. "I\'d rather be sitting over there in shorts and a T-shirt, wondering what the hell they\'re joking about, because I want to be a part of that joke," James said. "And I hate being out of all the jokes. I want to know what was happening, OK, guys? I would much rather be with my guys over there because that\'s what it\'s all about. Without those guys, this trophy is not possible." Much of the ceremony was tinged with emotion. Brinson\'s mother dabbed tears away from her eyes when James thanked his soon-to-be in-laws for what they do for his family. Dwyane Wade (who was 10th in the voting) spoke in a hushed tone on the video, with soft music playing in the background as he told James to "continue to lead this team because we believe in you, so congratulations, Mr. MVP." James seemed genuinely touched when dozens of students who are part of his "I Promise" educational program chanted for him when the proceedings were complete. "And all the ones that I\'ve observed and I\'ve watched and I\'ve seen, somewhere they\'ve always gotten better," said Heat President Pat Riley, talking about all the game\'s stars that he\'s witnessed in his 46 NBA years. "They always got better as their career advanced. And most importantly, they\'ve always made their teammates and their team better. In my humble opinion ... I think the man that we\'re looking at right here is the best of all of them." James was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in scoring, rebounding and assists per game this season, had a record six straight games of scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent, became the youngest player in league history to break the 20,000-career-point plateau and won five of the six Eastern Conference player of the month awards. James is now the second player in NBA history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, joining Larry Bird, who did it three times. The only other player to do it once was Jordan. "Four now," Heat managing general partner Micky Arison said. "And more to come."    \n   \n   \n\n     \n\n   \n    Copyright 2013 The_Associated_Press. All rights reserved.

The Miami Heat star will be introduced Sunday as the award winner, according to a person familiar with the results and who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the league has not publicly announced this year\'s recipient. James will become the fifth player with at least four MVP awards, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain. No one has ever swept every first-place vote in the NBA\'s MVP balloting. After the season he had, James could be the first. "I don\'t know who else you\'d vote for," Heat forward Chris Bosh said Friday. "No offense to everybody else, but that\'s just how good he has played this year." James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, shooting a career-best 56 percent. It was absolutely no surprise that he won the award, and given the timetable for Miami\'s next game &#8212; the Heat don\'t open Eastern Conference semifinal play until Monday night against Brooklyn or Chicago &#8212; it had been widely assumed for several days that Sunday would be the day. If tradition holds, NBA Commissioner David Stern will then present James with the trophy again Monday night in front of the Miami fans. "I absolutely have not even thought about it," James said earlier this week when asked if he considered the weight of winning the award four times in five years. "I have not thought about it, until you just brought it up. I know the history. It would be a unique, unbelievable class I would be a part of, so we\'ll see." Only Russell had won four MVPs in five years, and only Abdul-Jabbar had gone back-to-back on the award twice. James won the award in 2009 and 2010, only got four first-place votes in 2011 &#8212; his first season with the Heat &#8212; then reclaimed the award last season. "The other day I was sitting there with him, a week or two ago and it dawned on me," Heat guard Dwyane Wade told the AP. "I said to him, \'Do you know you\'re about to get four MVPs in five years?\' And he\'s like, \'Man, I\'m just a kid from Akron.\' He could have gotten five in five. You know how crazy that is? This is crazy." The "kid from Akron" is truly entering rarefied air now. It\'s certain that stars like New York\'s Carmelo Anthony, Oklahoma City\'s Kevin Durant and the Los Angeles Lakers\' Kobe Bryant will be listed on ballots &#8212; the league will unveil the full results Sunday &#8212; though the only drama left is seeing if any voter thought someone had a better season than James. A panel of writers and broadcasters from the United States and Canada vote for NBA awards. There also is one combined vote from fans who chose an MVP through online balloting or social media. There have been instances of people coming close to sweeping the first-place votes. Shaquille O\'Neal got 120 of the 121 top votes cast after the 1999-2000 season, with Allen Iverson getting the lone other one that year. And after the 2003-04 season, Kevin Garnett &#8212; then with Minnesota &#8212; got 120 of 123 votes, with two going to Jermaine O\'Neal and the other to Peja Stojakovic. "Do the right thing," was Heat forward Shane Battier\'s suggestion to voters, just before the ballots were due. James finally got his first NBA championship last season, followed that up by helping the U.S. win a gold medal at the London Olympics, and then vowed to come back this season even better. The Heat say he did absolutely that. With nary a sign of a championship hangover, Miami went 66-16 in the regular season, including a 27-game winning streak, the second-best in NBA history. And since Feb. 3, when James plays, Miami is 36-1. "We\'re all in unison: We think he has earned it," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "He has had an even more historic season than last year. The beauty of that, if he does in fact earn it, is the fact that probably most people didn\'t necessarily think he could go to a different level, a higher level, after last season. Yet he reinvented himself and showed that he could." Forget that it\'s rare in the NBA to win the MVP award four times. It\'s rare in major sports, period. In baseball, Barry Bonds is the lone member of the four-or-more-MVP club, winning seven. In hockey, it\'s Wayne Gretzky with nine, Gordie Howe with six and Eddie Shore with four. In the NFL, only Peyton Manning has four MVPs. "We never take him for granted," Spoelstra is fond of saying about James. When comparing James\' per-game averages this season against the best years in NBA history, only Jordan, Oscar Robertson, Larry Bird and John Havlicek had ever averaged so much in points, rebounds and assists per game as the reigning NBA Finals MVP did in each of those categories this season, according to STATS LLC. And none had ever done so while shooting such a high percentage &#8212; Jordan did it while shooting 54 percent, coming closest. James\' effective field goal percentage (a metric that takes into account 3-pointers being worth more than 2-point shots) this season was a career-best 60.3 percent, and he shot just over 40 percent from 3-point range, another career mark. The league handed out six Eastern Conference player-of-the-month awards this season, and James won five of them. "I can see why he loves to play the game," Wade said. "He can do anything he wants." Boston Celtics coach Doc Rivers said near the end of the regular season James &#8212; who also finished second in voting for this season\'s defensive player of the year award &#8212; might win this award many, many more times. "There\'s not a better player in the NBA than LeBron and he should win every year," Rivers said. "He should win in a landslide. There are guys who had great years. Carmelo\'s had an amazing year and so has Durant. But there\'s no one that\'s had the year that LeBron has when you figuring in rebounding, defense, everything, passing. And we\'re going to be saying that until someone else comes along and takes the mantle. I don\'t see that happening."  \n\n\n \n\n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n     \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n\n\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n\t\t View/Post Comments \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n Related Stories \n\n \n \n \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n \t  \n \n  NBA\'s LeBron James of Miami Heat wins MVP, 1 vote shy of unanimously \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n \t  \n \n  NBA fines breakdown over the last 10 years proves, \'So what, they can afford it\' \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n \n             Copyright 2013 cleveland.com.

The Miami Heat star was presented with the Maurice Podoloff Trophy for the fourth time in his career on Sunday after collecting 120 of the 121 first-place votes, with Carmelo Anthony of the New York Knicks picking up the lone remaining top choice. \n "It was probably a writer out of New York that didn\'t give me that vote," James said. "And we know the history between the Heat and the Knicks, so I get it." \n A panel of 120 sports writers and broadcasters cast ballots in the NBA MVP voting, with a combined online fan vote also being taken into account. \n Shaquille O\'Neal got every first-place vote but one in the 1999-2000 season, when one person cast his ballot for Allen Iverson &#8212; who finished seventh that year. This season, Kevin Durant of the Oklahoma City Thunder finished second, well ahead of Anthony, who was third and didn\'t even appear on nine of the ballots cast. James was the only player listed on all 121 ballots; Durant was omitted from two, according to the results released by the NBA. \n "Congrats to the king," O\'Neal wrote on his Twitter account. \n For months, there really had only been two questions about this season\'s MVP race: When will James get the award, and would the results be unanimous? The first of those answers became known Friday, the other on Sunday, and even as he was on the dais to pick up the award the now-four-time MVP quickly started steering all of his attention back to the goal of helping the Heat win a second straight title. \n Miami hosts Chicago in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Monday night, when NBA Commissioner David Stern will present James with the trophy, largely just for the benefit of giving Heat fans a pregame reason to cheer. \n "My ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship," James said. "That\'s what I was brought here for. That\'s why I signed here as a free agent in 2010. It wasn\'t to win MVP trophies. It was to win a championship &#8212; and win multiple championships &#8212; and that\'s still my No. 1 priority." \n James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists this season, leading Miami to a league-best 66-16 record while shooting a career-high 56 percent. Only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (six), Michael Jordan (five), Bill Russell (five) and Wilt Chamberlain (four) have as many MVP awards, only Russell won four in a five-year span, and only Abdul-Jabbar went back-to-back twice, like James did with trophies in 2009 and 2010 and now again in 2012 and 2013. \n Sunday\'s ceremony was filled with tributes and even some laughs, like when James\' younger son Bryce posed for photographers on stage while his father was speaking and older brother LeBron Jr. looked on &#8212; and when James\' fiancee, Savannah Brinson, appeared on a congratulatory video and called him "Honeybunny." \n "I know you\'re embarrassed when I call you that," Brinson said. "But whatever." \n Over on the far side of the dais, set up on the floor of the Heat home court, James\' teammates roared in hysterics &#8212; and Udonis Haslem made sure James knew that they were talking about Brinson\'s pet name for her future husband. The 14 other Heat players were dressed casually in team garb, while James donned a dapper suit for the festivities. \n As he did on Saturday, a day after it became widely known that the award would be his again, James thanked his teammates. \n "I\'d rather be sitting over there in shorts and a T-shirt, wondering what the hell they\'re joking about, because I want to be a part of that joke," James said. "And I hate being out of all the jokes. I want to know what was happening, OK, guys? I would much rather be with my guys over there because that\'s what it\'s all about. Without those guys, this trophy is not possible." \n Much of the ceremony was tinged with emotion. \n Brinson\'s mother dabbed tears away from her eyes when James thanked his soon-to-be in-laws for what they do for his family. Dwyane Wade (who was 10th in the voting) spoke in a hushed tone on the video, with soft music playing in the background as he told James to "continue to lead this team because we believe in you, so congratulations, Mr. MVP." James seemed genuinely touched when dozens of students who are part of his "I Promise" educational program chanted for him when the proceedings were complete. \n "And all the ones that I\'ve observed and I\'ve watched and I\'ve seen, somewhere they\'ve always gotten better," said Heat President Pat Riley, talking about all the game\'s stars that he\'s witnessed in his 46 NBA years. "They always got better as their career advanced. And most importantly, they\'ve always made their teammates and their team better. In my humble opinion ... I think the man that we\'re looking at right here is the best of all of them." \n James was the only player in the NBA to lead his team in scoring, rebounding and assists per game this season, had a record six straight games of scoring at least 30 points while shooting at least 60 percent, became the youngest player in league history to break the 20,000-career-point plateau and won five of the six Eastern Conference player of the month awards. \n James is now the second player in NBA history to post at least 2,000 points, 600 rebounds, 500 assists and 100 steals in a season twice, joining Larry Bird, who did it three times. The only other player to do it once was Jordan. \n "Four now," Heat managing general partner Micky Arison said. "And more to come." \n\n \n\n\n \n\n    \n \n    \n \n \n   \n     \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n\n\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n   \r\n   \r\n\t\t View/Post Comments \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n Related Stories \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n \t  \n \n  Ohio coal mines fight, and win routinely, against big federal fines \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n \t  \n \n  President Obama tells OSU graduates to participate, persevere -- and sleep in while you can \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n    \n \n             Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Standing at 6&#160;ft&#160;8&#160;in (2.03&#160;m) and weighing in at 250 pounds (113&#160;kg), he has played the small forward and power forward positions for Miami, as well as the Cleveland Cavaliers . James has been an NBA champion , an NBA Finals MVP , a four-time NBA MVP , an NBA scoring champion , and the NBA Rookie of the Year . He has also been selected to nine NBA All-Star Games , eight All-NBA teams, and four All-Defensive teams. James is also the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer . \n James played high school basketball at St. Vincent&#160;\xe2\x80\x93 St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron , Ohio . A two-time Gatorade National Basketball Player of the Year , he was highly promoted in the national media as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected with the first overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft by the Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to the 2007 NBA Finals , their first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history, but the team was swept by the San Antonio Spurs . In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Heat in a highly publicized free agency period. In his first year in Miami, the Heat reached the 2011 NBA Finals , but lost to the Dallas Mavericks . James won his first championship in 2012 when the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder , and was awarded the NBA Finals MVP Award. His career achievements and leadership role during the Heat\'s 2012 championship run have led a majority of basketball analysts, experts, and writers to consider him the best player in the NBA today. \n Off the court, James has accumulated considerable wealth and fame as a result of numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America\'s most disliked and influential athletes. He has also been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials, and has hosted the ESPY Awards and Saturday Night Live . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Early life \n \n 1.1 Childhood and youth \n 1.2 High school career \n \n 1.2.1 Basketball \n 1.2.2 Football \n \n \n \n \n 2 NBA career \n \n 2.1 Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\xe2\x80\x932010) \n \n 2.1.1 Rookie season \n 2.1.2 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season \n 2.1.3 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season \n 2.1.4 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season \n 2.1.5 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season \n 2.1.6 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season \n 2.1.7 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season \n \n \n 2.2 2010 free agency \n 2.3 Miami Heat (2010\xe2\x80\x93present) \n \n 2.3.1 Signing \n 2.3.2 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season \n 2.3.3 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season \n 2.3.4 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season \n \n \n \n \n 3 International career \n 4 Player profile \n 5 Off the court \n \n 5.1 Personal life \n 5.2 Endorsements \n 5.3 Entertainment \n 5.4 Public image \n 5.5 Salaries \n \n \n 6 NBA career statistics \n \n 6.1 Regular season \n 6.2 Playoffs \n \n \n 7 Awards and honors \n 8 See also \n 9 Notes \n 10 References \n 11 Further reading \n 12 External links \n \n \n \n \n Early life \n Childhood and youth \n James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron , Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised LeBron on her own. [ 1 ]  [ 2 ] Growing up, life was often a struggle for LeBron and Gloria, who moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. [ 3 ] Realizing he would be better off with a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed LeBron to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced LeBron to basketball when LeBron was nine-years-old. [ 4 ] \n As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. [ 3 ] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee. [ 5 ] Inseparable, they dubbed themselves the "Fab Four" and promised each other they would attend high school together. [ 6 ] In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent-St. Mary High School , a largely white school, instead of their local public school. [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] \n High school career \n Basketball \n In his freshman year, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s varsity team. [ 9 ] The Fighting Irish finished the year 27\xe2\x80\x930, winning the Division III state title. [ 9 ] In his sophomore year, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds per game, while also contributing 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game. [ 10 ] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent-St. Mary played at the University of Akron\'s 5,492-seat capacity Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, local fans, and college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26\xe2\x80\x931 and repeated as state champions. [ 9 ] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and was selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first ever sophomore to do either. [ 13 ] \n Prior to the start of James\' junior year, he appeared in SLAM Magazine and was lauded as possibly "the best high school basketball player in America right now" by writer Ryan Jones. [ 14 ] During the season, he appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated , becoming the first ever underclass high school basketball player to do so. [ 15 ] With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, [ 9 ] he was again named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, [ 9 ] and became the first ever junior to win the boys\' basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year Award . [ 16 ] St. Vincent-St. Mary finished the year with a 23\xe2\x80\x934 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game. [ 17 ] Following the loss, James seriously considered declaring for the 2002 NBA Draft , unsuccessfully petitioning for an adjustment to the NBA\'s draft eligibility rules which required prospective players to have at least graduated from high school. [ 18 ] During this time, James used marijuana to help cope with stress resulting from the constant media attention he was receiving. [ 19 ]  [ 20 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] \n In his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled around the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2 . [ 23 ]  Time Warner Cable , looking to capitalize on James\' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season. [ 24 ] For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, [ 13 ] was named Ohio\'s Mr. Basketball and USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, [ 25 ]  [ 9 ] and Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. [ 9 ] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games \xe2\x80\x93 the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the 2003 McDonald\'s All-American Game -, losing his NCAA eligibility and making it official he would enter the 2003 NBA Draft . [ 26 ] According to Ryan Jones, James left high school as "the most hyped basketball player ever". [ 27 ] \n During his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he accepted a Hummer H2 from his mother, who secured a loan for the vehicle utilizing LeBron\'s future earning power as a professional athlete. [ 28 ] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) as their guidelines state that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. [ 29 ] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for his posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high school sports eligibility. [ 29 ] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the season. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. [ 30 ] \n Football \n James played wide receiver for St. Vincent-St. Mary\'s football team in high school. [ 11 ] As a sophomore, he was named first-team all-state, and as a junior, he led the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. [ 10 ] His football career came to an end before his senior year when he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. [ 31 ] Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on whether he could have played in the National Football League . [ 32 ]  [ 33 ] \n NBA career \n Cleveland Cavaliers (2003\xe2\x80\x932010) \n Rookie season \n James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the number one overall pick in the 2003 NBA Draft. [ 34 ] In his first professional game, he recorded 25 points against the Sacramento Kings , setting an NBA record for most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut outing. [ 35 ] In a late season match-up with the New Jersey Nets , he scored a season-high 41 points, becoming the youngest player in league history to score at least 40 points in a game at 19 years. [ 36 ] James was eventually named the NBA Rookie of the Year , finishing with averages of 20.9 points, 5.9 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] He became the first Cavalier to receive the honor and joined Oscar Robertson and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game in their rookie season ( Tyreke Evans has since joined this group). [ 38 ] The Cavaliers finished the season 35\xe2\x80\x9347, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous season. [ 39 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames sizes up his defender in March 2005 as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers . \n \n \n 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season \n James recorded his first ever triple-double on January 19 of the 2004\xe2\x80\x9305 season , becoming the youngest player in league history to record a triple-double at 20 years. [ 37 ]  [ 40 ] His play earned him his first NBA All-Star Game selection, where he added 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference . [ 41 ] On March 20, James scored a career-high 56 points against the Toronto Raptors , setting Cleveland\'s new single game points record. [ 42 ] With averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game to finish the season, he became the youngest player in league history to be named to an All-NBA Team , being selected to the All-NBA Second Team. [ 10 ] Despite a 30\xe2\x80\x9320 record to start the year, [ 42 ] Cleveland again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the year with a 42\xe2\x80\x9340 record. [ 43 ] \n 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season \n At the 2006 NBA All-Star Game , James led the East to victory with a 29 point, 6 rebound, 2 assist performance, and became the youngest ever winner of the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award at 21 years, 51 days. [ 44 ] For the 2005\xe2\x80\x9306 season , he averaged 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game, becoming the youngest player in NBA history to average at least 30 points per game. [ 37 ]  [ 45 ] He was considered a strong candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award , but eventually finished second in the voting to Steve Nash ; however, he was awarded co-MVP honors with Nash by The Sporting News , [ 46 ] and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. [ 47 ] \n Under James\' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998, [ 48 ] improving their record by 33 wins from three years prior. [ 49 ] In his playoff debut, he recorded a triple-double with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards . [ 50 ] He joined Johnny McCarthy and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to register a triple-double in their playoff debut. [ 50 ] For the series, James averaged 35.7 points per game and Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games. [ 51 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers were ousted by the defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons . [ 52 ] James\' final playoff averages were 30.8 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game. [ 37 ] \n After the playoffs, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60&#160;million contract extension with a player option for a fourth year. [ 53 ] Although it was for fewer years and less money than the maximum he could sign, it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season . [ 53 ] He discussed this decision with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh , fellow members of his 2003 draft class, who also re-signed with their respective teams while allowing them to be unrestricted agents in 2010. [ 54 ] \n 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames at the free throw line in April 2007. \n \n \n In the 2006\xe2\x80\x9307 season , James averaged 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game. [ 10 ]  [ 55 ] The Cavaliers finished the year with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed. [ 56 ] In the first round, Cleveland defeated the Wizards for the second straight season, sweeping them in four games. [ 57 ] For the series, James averaged 27.8 points, 7.5 assists, and 8.5 rebounds per game. [ 37 ] In the second round, James averaged 25.0 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 8.6 assists per game, leading the Cavaliers past the Nets in six games. [ 58 ]  [ 58 ] In the Eastern Conference Finals, Cleveland faced the Pistons in a rematch from the year before. [ 59 ] In Game 5, James notched a playoff franchise record 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, and scored 29 of the Cavaliers\' last 30 points including the game-winning lay-up with two seconds left. [ 60 ] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance "one of the greatest moments in postseason history" and color commentator Steve Kerr called it "Jordan-esque." [ 61 ] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in NBA playoff history. [ 62 ] Cleveland won the series to advance to the Finals versus San Antonio , losing in four games. [ 59 ] For the postseason, James averaged 25.1 points, 8.0 assists, and 8.1 rebounds per game, although his Finals averages dropped to 22.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. [ 10 ]  [ 37 ] \n 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season \n During the 2007\xe2\x80\x9308 season , James was named the All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27 point, 8 rebound, 9 assist, 2 block, and 2 steal performance. [ 63 ]  [ 64 ] On February 27, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 10,000 career points at 23 years, 59 days in a game against the Boston Celtics . [ 65 ] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers\' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty. [ 66 ]  [ 66 ] With seven triple-doubles to finish the year, James set a new personal and team record for triple-doubles in a season. [ 67 ] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, representing his first scoring title . [ 68 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008. \n \n \n Despite James\' individual accomplishments, Cleveland\'s record fell from the year before to 45\xe2\x80\x9337. [ 69 ] Seeded fourth in the Eastern Conference entering the playoffs , the Cavaliers were matched up with the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season. [ 70 ] In a pre-series interview, Washington guard DeShawn Stevenson stirred up controversy when he called James "overrated". [ 71 ] James answered by saying that responding to Stevenson would be like rap icon Jay-Z feuding with one-hit wonder Soulja Boy . [ 71 ] In the series, Cleveland defeated the Wizards in six games before being eliminated in seven games by the Celtics in the next round. [ 72 ] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a "shootout". [ 73 ] \n 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season \n \n \n \n  \nJames defends Paul Pierce of the Boston Celtics in October 2008. \n \n \n In the 2008\xe2\x80\x9309 season , James finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first All-Defensive Team behind 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. [ 74 ]  [ 75 ] He also became the fourth player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories (total points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks) in one season. [ 76 ] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star Mo Williams , the Cavaliers went a franchise record 66\xe2\x80\x9316 and fell one game short of matching the best home record in league history. [ 77 ] With averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and a career-high 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the NBA MVP Award. [ 78 ]  [ 79 ]  [ 80 ] \n In the playoffs , Cleveland swept the Pistons in the first round. [ 81 ] At the end of Game 4, Detroit\'s home crowd started an MVP chant for James, who registered 36 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 assists that night. [ 82 ] In the next round, the Cavaliers swept the Atlanta Hawks . [ 83 ] In the Conference Finals, Cleveland were matched up with the Orlando Magic . [ 81 ] In Game 1, James scored 49 points with a 66 percent shooting rate in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. [ 62 ] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 84 ] The Cavaliers would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, an act many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. [ 85 ] James later told reporters: "It\'s hard for me to congratulate somebody after you just lose to them, I\'m a winner. It\'s not being a poor sport or anything like that. If somebody beats you up, you\'re not going to congratulate them. ... I\'m a competitor. That\'s what I do. It doesn\'t make sense for me to go over and shake somebody\'s hand." [ 86 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attacks the basket in April 2009. \n \n \n 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season \n To address their lack of an inside presence against Orlando, the Cavaliers traded for center Shaquille O\'Neal before the 2009\xe2\x80\x9310 season. [ 87 ] To give James more scoring help, Cleveland also added All-Star Antawn Jamison to their roster at the trading deadline. [ 88 ] On March 13, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 15,000 career points at 25 years, 79 days during a game against the Chicago Bulls . [ 89 ] At the end of the season, he was named NBA MVP for the second consecutive year with averages of 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, a career-high 8.6 assists, 1 block, and 1.6 steals per game on 50 percent shooting. [ 90 ] The Cavaliers also finished the regular season with the league\'s best record for the second straight year. [ 91 ] \n In the playoffs , the Cavaliers beat the Chicago Bulls in the first round but fell to the Celtics in the second round. [ 92 ] James was heavily criticized for not playing well, particularly in Game 5 of the series when he shot only 20 percent on 14 shots, scoring 15 points. [ 93 ] At the conclusion of the game he walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland\'s home crowd, the team having just suffered their worst home playoff loss ever. [ 94 ] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated in Game 6, with James recording 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists, but on just 38 percent shooting with 9 turnovers. [ 92 ] \n 2010 free agency \n \n \n \n  \nJames takes a free throw against the Atlanta Hawks in April 2010. \n \n \n Main article: The Decision (TV special) \n James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01&#160;am EDT on July 1, 2010. [ 95 ] During his free agency he was courted by several teams including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers , Miami Heat , Knicks, New Jersey Nets , and Cavaliers. [ 96 ] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat. [ 97 ] The telecast, broadcast from the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut , raised $2.5 million for the charity and an additional $3.5 million from advertisement revenue that was donated to other charities. [ 98 ]  [ 99 ] The day before the special, fellow free agents Bosh and Wade had also announced they would sign with Miami. [ 100 ]  [ 101 ] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less load offensively, thinking that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning a championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. [ 102 ]  [ 103 ] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. [ 104 ] Relieved of the burden of scoring, James thought he could be the first player to average a triple-double in a season since Oscar Robertson . [ 102 ]  [ 105 ] \n James drew immense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players for leaving the Cavaliers. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought the prolonged wait for James\' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show. [ 106 ] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James\' actions. [ 107 ] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey. [ 108 ] Former NBA players including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as "the guy". [ 109 ]  [ 110 ]  [ 111 ] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision . [ 112 ]  [ 113 ] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America\'s most disliked athletes, a radical change from years prior. [ 114 ]  [ 115 ] The phrase "taking my talents to South Beach" became a punch line for critics. [ 116 ]  [ 117 ] \n Immediately following The Decision , James claimed that there was nothing he would change about the handling of his free agency despite all the criticism. [ 118 ] Since then, he has expressed remorse over his actions. During the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season, he said he "probably would do it a little bit different ... But I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my decision." [ 119 ] James relented about the special before the 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season: "... if the shoe was on the other foot and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." [ 115 ] \n Miami Heat (2010\xe2\x80\x93present) \n Signing \n James officially became a member of the Heat on July 10, completing a sign-and-trade six-year contract with the team. [ 120 ] With the move, he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982 . [ 121 ] Although his contract would have allowed him to earn the maximum salary under the collective bargaining agreement , he took less money in order for Miami to be able to afford Bosh and Wade as well as further roster support. [ 122 ] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new "big three" at the American Airlines Arena , an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere. [ 123 ] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships. [ 124 ]  [ 125 ] Outside of Miami the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James. [ 126 ]  [ 127 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Miami Heat . \n \n \n 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season \n Throughout the 2010\xe2\x80\x9311 season , James embraced the villain role bestowed upon him by the media. He later said that the negativity surrounding him as a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period "basically turned me into somebody I wasn\'t ... You start to hear \'the villain,\' now you have to be the villain, you know, and I started to buy into it. I started to play the game of basketball at a level, or at a mind state that I\'ve never played at before ... meaning, angry. And that\'s mentally. That\'s not the way I play the game of basketball." [ 128 ] He often played the point guard role that Riley sold to him during free agency, and in an early season victory versus the Minnesota Timberwolves , he was Miami\'s primary ball handler and registered a game-high 12 assists, the most ever by a Heat forward. [ 129 ]  [ 130 ]  [ 131 ]  [ 132 ]  [ 129 ] On December 2, he returned to Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent, scoring 38 points and leading Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. [ 133 ]  [ 134 ] He finished his debut season on the Heat with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.6 steals per game on 51 percent shooting. [ 47 ] \n Entering the playoffs as the Eastern Conference\'s second seed, Miami defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and the Celtics in the second round. [ 135 ] In the Conference Finals, Miami met the first-seeded Bulls, winning in five games. [ 135 ] In the 2011 NBA Finals , Miami stumbled against the Dallas Mavericks , losing in six games despite holding a 2\xe2\x80\x931 series lead going into Game 4. [ 135 ] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only 3 points in fourth quarters in the series. [ 136 ] His scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the lowest such drop-off in league history. [ 137 ] \n 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season \n Humbled by Miami\'s loss to Dallas, James spent the offseason attempting to improve himself as a basketball player and a person, and worked with Hakeem Olajuwon on his post game. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] The Heat opened the lockout-shortened 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 season on a strong note, finishing January with a 16\xe2\x80\x935 record and matching their best start to a season in franchise history. [ 140 ] In the 2012 All-Star Game , James tied Kevin Durant with a game-high 36 points and tied the All-Star Game record of six three-pointers made. [ 141 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named league MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting. [ 142 ] \n The Heat entered the playoffs with the second seed in the Eastern Conference. [ 143 ] They defeated the Knicks in five games in the first round before falling behind 2\xe2\x80\x931 to Indiana in the second round. [ 143 ] In Game 4, James turned in one of the best all-around performances of his career, registering 40 points, 18 rebounds, and 9 assists in a winning effort on the road. [ 144 ] Miami eventually won the series in six games. [ 143 ] In the Conference Finals, the Heat again faced the Celtics , winning the first two games before dropping the next three. [ 143 ] Facing elimination, James lead Miami to victory by scoring 45 points in Game 6, making 19 of 26 shot attempts for a 73 percent shooting rate. [ 145 ] He also contributed 15 rebounds and 5 assists, becoming the second player in league history to do so besides Wilt Chamberlain for the San Francisco Warriors in 1964 . [ 146 ] The Heat won Game 7 to advance to the 2012 NBA Finals . [ 143 ] \n In the Finals, the Heat were matched up with the Oklahoma City Thunder . [ 143 ] Despite holding a 13-point first half lead in Game 1, Miami lost the first game of the series. [ 147 ] In Game 2, the Heat again built a double-digit lead, this time holding on and winning to tie the series at 1\xe2\x80\x931. [ 148 ] Back in Miami, the Heat took Game 3 to go up 2\xe2\x80\x931. [ 149 ] Game 4 proved to be a memorable one for James. With five minutes left in the game, he started experiencing leg cramps and was carried off the floor. He returned soon after and hit a three-pointer with 2:51 left to give Miami a three point lead they did not relinquish. [ 150 ] In Game 5, James registered his only triple-double of the season with 26 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second ever championship and James\' first championship. [ 151 ] James was unanimously voted the NBA Finals MVP with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. [ 152 ] His final playoff averages were 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. [ 153 ] \n 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season \n On January 16 of the 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 season , James became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points at 28 years, 17 days during a game against the Golden State Warriors . [ 154 ] In February, he had a "month for the ages". [ 155 ] To start the month, he became the first player in league history to score at least 30 points and shoot at least 60 percent in six straight games. [ 156 ] He finished the month having made 139 of 217 field goals, becoming the first player since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in March 1983 to take more than 200 shots in a calendar month and make at least 64 percent of them. [ 157 ] During this period, the Heat began a 27-game winning streak, the second longest in league history . [ 158 ] Behind his play, Miami finished the year with a franchise and league best 66-16 record. [ 159 ] At the conclusion of the season, James was named the NBA Most Valuable Player for the fourth time, after averaging 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting. He received 120 out of 121 first-place votes, one shy of becoming the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. He also finished second in voting for the Defensive Player of the Year award, which he expressed interest in winning. [ 160 ] \n International career \n \n \n \n  \nJames attempts a shot over China\'s Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing. \n \n \n James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece . [ 161 ] U.S. Olympic coach Larry Brown said that James, accustomed to being a star, was not 100% receptive to a reduced role. [ 162 ] James spent the Olympics mostly on the bench without quality playing time, [ 163 ]  [ 164 ] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games. [ 161 ] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding professionals to their line-up. [ 161 ]  [ 165 ] James felt his limited playing time was a "lowlight" and believed he was not given "a fair opportunity to play". [ 166 ] His attitude during the Olympics was described as "disrespectful" and "distasteful" by columnists Adrian Wojnarowski and Peter Vecsey , respectively. [ 167 ]  [ 168 ] \n At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan , James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain. [ 169 ]  [ 170 ] The team finished the tournament with an 8\xe2\x80\x931 record, winning another bronze medal. [ 169 ] James\' behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen , who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members. [ 167 ]  [ 171 ] \n Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team , Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice. [ 167 ]  [ 172 ] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007 , he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier. [ 173 ]  [ 174 ] Team USA went 10\xe2\x80\x930, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China . [ 161 ] James credited the team\'s attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: "I don\'t think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now." [ 164 ] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000 . [ 175 ] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain. [ 175 ] \n James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England . [ 176 ]  [ 177 ] He became the leader of the team with Kobe Bryant , who would soon be 34, stepping back. [ 178 ]  [ 179 ]  [ 180 ] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed. [ 112 ]  [ 181 ]  [ 182 ]  [ 183 ] During the Games, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history. [ a ] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game. [ 185 ] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men\'s basketball history. [ 161 ]  [ 185 ] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, and Olympic gold medal in the same year. [ 186 ] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said James "is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now." [ 187 ] \n Player profile \n \n \n \n  \nJames drives to the basket in March 2008. \n \n \n Standing at six feet, eight inches tall and weighing in at 250 pounds, James has been called the best physical specimen in sports by some sports analysts. [ 188 ]  [ 189 ] He has started at the small forward and power forward positions, but can also play and guard the other three positions. [ 153 ] With career averages of 27.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 7.3 rebounds per game, [ 47 ] he is considered one of the most versatile players in the NBA, [ 190 ] and has been compared to Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. [ 37 ]  [ 191 ] He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, and All-Defensive honors every season since 2009. [ 47 ] With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain , and Bill Russell . [ 192 ] Since 2011, James has been ranked the best player in the NBA by ESPN\'s #NBArank project. [ 193 ]  [ 194 ]  [ 195 ] \n In Cleveland, James was used as an on-ball point forward, and his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented. [ 190 ] He established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in the NBA, leading the league in completed traditional three point plays in various seasons. [ 10 ] He also regularly ranked as one of the league leaders in rebounds for his position. [ 196 ]  [ 197 ] Despite his award-worthy play with the Cavaliers, he was criticized for not developing a reliable jump shot or post game, [ 198 ] areas he improved in Miami, where Heat coach Eric Spoelstra changed James\' role to a more unconventional one. [ 190 ] James began spending more time in the post and shooting less three pointers, attempting a career-low 149 in 2012. [ 190 ]  [ 47 ] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat\'s "pass-happy" offense. [ 199 ] \n James\' clutch play has been the subject of much scrutiny throughout his career. He has been repeatedly criticized by the media for his play in pressure situations; specifically, for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games. [ 200 ]  [ 201 ] In a 2011 interview, teammate Chris Bosh stated that he would rather have Dwyane Wade take a last-second shot than James. [ 202 ] On the other hand, a 2011 article by Henry Abbott revealed that James had a better shooting percentage with the game on the line than such notables as Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant. [ 203 ] Additionally, a 2012 feature by ESPN ranked three of James\' playoff performances as some of the greatest in NBA history. [ 62 ] \n Off the court \n Personal life \n James has two children with his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The first, LeBron James Jr., was born on October 6, 2004, [ 204 ] and the second, Bryce Maximus James, on June 14, 2007. [ 62 ]  [ 204 ] They currently reside in Coconut Grove , a Miami suburb, where James bought a three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay for $9&#160;million. [ 205 ] James became engaged to Brinson on December 31, 2011, proposing to her at a party to celebrate New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve and his 27th birthday. [ 206 ] \n Endorsements \n James has endorsement contracts with Nike , Sprite , Glac\xc3\xa9au , Bubblicious , Upper Deck , McDonald\'s , State Farm , Dunkin\' Brands , and Audemars Piguet . [ 207 ]  [ 208 ]  [ 209 ]  [ 210 ] His initial contract with Nike was worth almost $90 million. [ 211 ] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of James\' rights, and as part of the deal, he and his manager Maverick Carter were granted minority stakes in the English Premier League football club Liverpool F.C. [ 212 ] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world\'s highest-paid athletes. [ 213 ]  [ 214 ] \n \n \n \n  \nJames is a minority stakeholder of Liverpool F.C. \n \n \n Entertainment \n James, with comedian Jimmy Kimmel , co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards . [ 215 ] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd season premiere of Saturday Night Live . [ 216 ] In 2009, he was featured in the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game , which chronicled his high school years. [ 217 ] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage . [ 218 ] \n Public image \n In 2010, James was ranked by Forbes as the second most influential athlete behind Lance Armstrong . [ 219 ] As a member of the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on their world headquarters throughout his tenure with the team. [ 220 ] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians games against the New York Yankees dressed in a Yankees hat. [ 221 ] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision , he has been listed as one of the most disliked athletes. [ 222 ]  [ 223 ] \n A philanthropist, James is an active supporter of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of America, Children\'s Defense Fund , and ONEXONE . [ 224 ] He has also established his own charity foundation called the LeBron James Family Foundation, based out of Akron. [ 225 ] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon in Akron to raise money for various causes. [ 226 ] \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n The WWI Destroy This Mad Brute poster, the 1933 King Kong movie poster and the April 2008 Vogue cover with James and Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen which critics said referenced the earlier posters. [ 227 ]  [ 228 ] \n \n \n \n \n \n In March 2008, James became the first black man\xe2\x80\x94and third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney \xe2\x80\x94to appear on the cover of Vogue , posing with Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen . [ 229 ] Some sports bloggers and columnists considered the cover offensive, describing the demeanor of James and his holding B\xc3\xbcndchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong , a dark savage capturing his light-skinned love interest. [ 227 ]  [ 228 ] \n While James has largely avoided political issues, he drew criticism in 2007 when he declined to sign a petition started by his Cavaliers teammate Ira Newble regarding the Chinese government \'s alleged involvement in the ongoing conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan , stating that he did not know enough about the issue. [ 230 ]  [ 231 ] A year later, James did talk publicly about the issue, saying, "At the end of the day we\'re talking about human rights. And people should understand that human rights and people\'s lives are in jeopardy. We\'re not talking about contracts here. We\'re not talking about money. We\'re talking about people\'s lives being lost and that means a lot more to me than some money or a contract." [ 232 ]  [ 233 ] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee to elect Barack Obama . [ 234 ] On October 29, 2008, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama\'s 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.
