The game has been called "the most famous football game in Ivy League history". [ 1 ]  [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 5 ]  [ 6 ] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Story \n 2 Production \n 3 Cast \n 4 Reception \n 5 References \n 6 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Story \n For the first time since 1909, the football teams of Harvard and Yale were each undefeated with 6-0 records in their conference (8-0 overall) when they met for their season\'s final game on November 23, 1968 [ 1 ] at Harvard Stadium . [ 7 ] Led by their quarterback captain Brian Dowling , Yale was heavily favored to win and they quickly led the game 22\xe2\x80\x930. [ 8 ] With two minutes remaining on the clock they still led 29\xe2\x80\x9313. [ 1 ] As the last seconds ticked down, Harvard, coached by John Yovicsin , tied the game, scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds. [ 1 ]  [ 8 ]  The Harvard Crimson declared victory with a famous headline, "Harvard Beats Yale 29-29," [ 1 ]  [ 8 ] providing the title for Rafferty\xe2\x80\x99s documentary. [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 5 ] \n [ edit ] Production \n Created essentially as a one-man production, Rafferty followed a simple production plan by inter-cutting broadcast video of the game with interviews he\'d done with close to 50 of the surviving players. [ 4 ] The broadcast video was a color kinescope of the WHDH telecast, with Don Gillis doing the play-by-play . [ 10 ] The film was set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1968 game between Yale and Harvard. [ 11 ] \n The documentary includes game footage with contemporary interviews with the men who played that day, as well as contextual commentary about the Vietnam War , the sexual revolution , Garry Trudeau \'s Yale cartoons, and various players\' relationships with George W. Bush (Yale), Al Gore (Harvard), and Meryl Streep ( Vassar ). \n [ edit ] Cast \n \n Tommy Lee Jones as himself - Harvard Guard \n Brian Dowling as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Yale Quarterback \n Don Gillis as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Sportscaster \n George Bass as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Yale Tackle \n Frank Champi as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Harvard Quarterback \n Bruce Freeman as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Harvard End \n Rick Frisbie as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Harvard Cornerback \n Vic Gatto as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Harvard Halfback ( Team Captain ) \n Kyle Gee as himself \xe2\x80\x93 Yale Tackle \n J.P.

But this winning doc also offers serious reflection on how events from our past continue to loom large in our lives - as regrets still counted, as lessons learned, as triumphs that awe and amaze." [ 12 ]  J. Hoberman of Village Voice wrote "This may or may not be the greatest instance of college football ever played, but Brian\'s Song , Jerry Maguire , and The Longest Yard notwithstanding, Rafferty\'s no-frills annotated replay is the best football movie I\'ve ever seen: A particular day in history becomes a moment out of time." [ 11 ]  Michael Sragow of the Baltimore Sun called the film "Kevin Rafferty\'s magnum opus". [ 13 ]  Mark Feeney of Boston Globe called the film "terrifically entertaining". [ 2 ] Manhola Dargis of the New York Times found the film to be "preposterously entertaining". [ 14 ] Tom Keogh of Seattle Times called it a "a delightful documentary". [ 15 ] In greater depth, Bob Hoover of Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote "Despite his annoying style of lingering a bit too long on his subjects, Rafferty, mainly a TV documentary maker, pries fascinating stories and insights from the now aging players," [ 16 ] and Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote "A look at the legendary Nov. 23, 1968, game, "Harvard Beats Yale" is both an irresistible human story and as fine a documentary on football as " Hoop Dreams " was on basketball", calling the film "a memorable winner". He further notes that the passage of 40 years allowed a unique perspective as the players spoke about "what was not only the game of their careers but possibly the experience of their lives", and made note of how time led to other celebrity for some of the players, with Tommy Lee Jones becoming an Oscar -winning actor, Brian Dowling becoming the character "B.D." in the Doonesbury comic strip ( Garry Trudeau attended Yale), and player Bob Levin remembering dating a Vassar undergraduate named Meryl Streep ." [ 4 ] \n Underscoring that the film had appeal to more than just sports fans, Bruce Elder of All Movie Guide began his review with "it is only fair of this writer to point out that he cares not one whit about, and has not a scintilla of interest in football. Having said that, we can also say, without equivocation, that Kevin Rafferty\'s Harvard Beats Yale 29-29 is a dazzling, engrossing, must-see piece of film all about...football.

(December 2006)  \n \n \n Harvard College \'s residential houses and Yale University \'s residential colleges have established sisterly relationships, much like the Oxbridge sister colleges . [ 1 ] The living quarters were made possible by philanthropist Edward S. Harkness . \n These twinnings are rarely invoked nowadays, except on the weekend of The Game when some houses/colleges find accommodation for visiting rival fans. \n In 2005, additional affiliations between Harvard\'s freshman dormitories, which are not affiliated with Harvard\'s residential houses and Yale\'s residential colleges were established in order to accommodate Harvard freshmen at Yale for the 2005 Game. They are not permanent affiliations and may change in the future. They are listed below in parentheses. \n \n \n \n Harvard \n Yale \n \n \n Adams House \n(Weld Hall) \n Saybrook College \n \n \n Cabot House \n(Wigglesworth Hall) \n Trumbull College \n \n \n Currier House \n(Canaday Hall) \n Ezra Stiles College \n \n \n Dudley House \n Pforzheimer House \n(Matthews Hall) \n Silliman College * \n \n \n Dunster House \n(Mower, Lionel, and Massachusetts Halls and Apley Court) \n Berkeley College \n \n \n Eliot House \n(Straus Hall) \n Jonathan Edwards College \n \n \n Kirkland House \n(Thayer Hall) \n Calhoun College \n \n \n Mather House \n(Hurlbut and Stoughton Halls) \n Morse College \n \n \n Leverett House \n(Greenough Hall) \n Timothy Dwight College \n \n \n Lowell House \n(Grays Hall) \n Pierson College \n \n \n Quincy House \n(Pennypacker Hall) \n Branford College \n \n \n Winthrop House \n(Hollis and Holworthy Halls) \n Davenport College \n \n \n \n \n Note: Although Harvard has 13 houses and Yale only 12 colleges, Dudley house has only a handful of undergraduates, and is doubled-up with Pforzheimer as sisters of Silliman, the largest of the Yale colleges. \n \n Although some of these houses and colleges have established links to various Oxford and Cambridge colleges, the ties are not transitive so it is impossible to make a four\xe2\x80\x93column chart.

It is very difficult to get into, and each graduating class is relatively small. (As compared to other law schools throughout the USA.) It is VERY difficult to get into, and quite expensive once you get in. \n\n Be prepared to work your tail off in the academics region here. You&#39;re not going to have much time for anything else. Internships are very competitive, so apply early and make sure you don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket. \n\n The campus, of course, is gorgeous. Most law students, however, don&#39;t live on campus. There are plenty of (high-priced) apartments nearby. \n\n PROS: the best law school in the country\n CONS: expensive \n\n \n   \n   Was this review helpful to you? \n\n   \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\t\n \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n   \n   Provided By\n   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n  \n    \n   \n  Similar Nearby \n  \n  \n    \n    1 \n    \n     Harvard University \n     \n     \n      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; \n      1 review \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    0.06 mi\n    \n    \n  \n    \n    2 \n    \n     Lesley University \n     \n     \n      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;&#9734; \n      2 reviews \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    0.56 mi\n    \n    \n  \n    \n    3 \n    \n     Fogg Art Museum \n     \n     \n      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; \n      2 reviews \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    0.74 mi\n    \n    \n  \n    \n    4 \n    \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     \n     \n      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734; \n      1 review \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    0.74 mi\n    \n    \n  \n    \n    5 \n    \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n     \n     \n      &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; \n      1 review \n     \n     \n    \n    \n    0.74 mi\n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n \n \n \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n\n  \n  Home |\n  About Us |\n  FAQ |\n  Blog |\n  Help/Contact Us |\n  Feedback |\n  Store Finder |\n  Doctor Finder |\n  Sitemap |\n  Privacy Policy (updated) |\n  Terms &amp; Conditions \n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n  &copy; 2004&ndash;2013 Insider Pages.

(Scott Stafford / Berkshire Eagle Staff)     Sunday May 5, 2013  WILLIAMSTOWN -- Williams College students have joined more than 300 colleges and 100 cities and states in a national campaign by asking the school\'s endowment fund to divest from any coal producing companies.\n\n\n\n According to Sam Lewis, a sophomore at Williams and one of the organizers of student environmental advocates Thursday Night Group (TNG), students have been tracking the divestment campaign since its beginnings in 2012.\n\n\n\n The campaign to divest from coal production is gathering momentum: There are divestment campaigns at 305 colleges, including Brown University, Syracuse University, Harvard University, and the University of California San Diego. \n\n\n\n More that 100 cities and states are the setting for still more divestment campaigns: Already 10 cities, including Seattle and San Francisco, have decided to withdraw any investments in fossil fuel production. The campaign has also spread to Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and Britain.\n\n\n\n In October, TNG kicked off the divestment campaign with a rally, and have since collected more than 200 student signatures and composed a resolution requesting that the college refrain from investing in any coal-producing companies.\n\n\n\n The student governing organization, College Council, passed the resolution with an overwhelming majority last week.\n\n\n\n "Part of the College Council\'s mission is to be a voice for the student body," noted Max Heninger, a junior at the school and co-president of the Advertisement  College Council. "And student support here for the divest movement is certainly significant enough for the College Council to support it."\n\n\n\n "We feel that to continue to be investing in something that will be detrimental to its students and to students around the globe is not in line with the college\'s mission," Lewis said.\n\n\n\n "When you have groups like TNG coming forward with an issue that represents the heart and soul of this school, it only serves to raise awareness and gain further support," Heninger said. "Colleges and universities are a voice for a generation that is going to have to deal with the effects of climate change."\n\n\n\n The resolution asks the college to refrain from investing in coal-producing companies from a fund that represents 3 percent of the overall endowment. This 3 percent fund is directly invested by the college.\n\n\n\n According to James Kolesar, spokesman for Williams College, that fund has no current investments in coal production. The council\'s resolution has been passed on to the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibilities. This committee has two faculty, two students, two staff members and two alumni that make investment suggestions to the Board of Trustees\' Finance Committee, which makes the final investment decisions.\n\n\n\n Kolesar said the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibilities is considering the resolution and had not yet made any decision.\n\n\n\n The other 97 percent of the school\'s $1.8 billion endowment is handled by account managers of corporate investment firms, which are logistically hampered from making individual investment strategies for individual funds.\n\n\n\n TNG is also seeking a way to influence those investing decisions, Lewis noted.\n\n\n\n "We\'re making a moral and financial stand against companies that profit by producing coal," Lewis said.\n\n\n\n To reach Scott Stafford: \n sstafford@berkshireeagle.com , \nor (413) 496-6241. \nOn Twitter: @BE_SStafford  Copyright 2012 Berkshire Eagle.

Now researchers at Yale Medical School, Harvard Medical School and the Broad Institute have identified a prime suspect in the mystery \xe2\x80\x94 dietary salt. In the March 6 issue of the journal Nature, Yale researchers showed that salt can induce and worsen pathogenic immune system responses in mice and that the response is regulated by genes already implicated in a variety of autoimmune diseases. In accompanying papers in the same issue of Nature, researchers from Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital and Harvard identified the key molecular pathway involved in the response to salt, and the Broad Institute sketched out the regulatory network of genes that governs this autoimmune response. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not diseases of bad genes alone or diseases caused by the environment, but diseases of a bad interaction between genes and the environment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. David Hafler , the Gilbert H. Glaser Professor of Neurology, professor of immunobiology, chair of the Department of Neurology, and senior author of the Yale paper. The research was inspired, in part, by an observation that eating at fast-food restaurants tended to trigger an increase in production of inflammatory cells, which are mobilized by the immune system to respond to injury or pathogens but which, in autoimmune diseases, attack healthy tissue. Researchers at Yale and colleagues in Germany led by Dominik Mueller wanted to know whether high salt content in diet might induce the destructive immune system response that is the hallmark of autoimmunity. They found that adding salt to the diet of mice induced production of a type of T cells previously associated with autoimmune diseases and that mice on salt diets developed a more severe form of an MS animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The research at the Broad Institute, Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, Harvard University, and Yale University expands the understanding of how one type of immune cell \xe2\x80\x94 known as a T helper 17 or Th17 cell \xe2\x80\x94 develops, and how its growth influences the development of other kinds of cells involved in the immune system. Reconstruction of this molecular circuitry confirmed the surprising role of salt, said the researchers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question we wanted to pursue was: How does this highly pathogenic, pro-inflammatory T cell develop?\xe2\x80\x9d said Vijay Kuchroo, a senior scientist at Brigham and Women\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital and a Broad Institute associate member. Kuchroo is also the Wasserstrom Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Biomedical Research Institutes. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce we have a more nuanced understanding of the development of the pathogenic Th17 cells, we may be able to pursue ways to regulate them or their function.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHumans were genetically selected for conditions in sub-Saharan Africa, where there was no salt,\xe2\x80\x9d Hafler said. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, Western diets all have high salt content and that has led to increase in hypertension and perhaps autoimmune disease as well.\xe2\x80\x9d Hafler noted that all test-tube cell biology is performed based on the salt levels found in blood and not in the tissues where immune cell ultimately travel to fight infections. That may have been a reason salt\xe2\x80\x99s role in autoimmunity has gone undetected. \xe2\x80\x9cWe may have been using the wrong concentrations of salt in our experiments for the past half-century,\xe2\x80\x9d Hafler said. \xe2\x80\x9cNature did not want immune cells to become turned on in the pipeline, so perhaps blood salt levels are inhibitory.\xe2\x80\x9d Patient trials to assess effects of salt on autoimmune diseases are being planned.. \xe2\x80\x9cThe value in doing an unbiased analysis is that we\xe2\x80\x99re able to understand a lot more about the molecular biology at play and put forth a completely novel process,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aviv Regev, a Broad Institute core member and an associate professor of biology at MIT. Regev is also an Early Career Scientist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the director of the Klarman Cell Observatory at the Broad.

Yale entered as No. 12 to Harvard-Radcliffe\'s No. 7, but the Bulldog women\'s eight jumped out to an early lead that they refused to relinquish in tailwind conditions in Boston, with Northeastern trailing in third. The following day, Yale backed up their victory over the Black and White with a defeat of No. 9 Brown on the Housatonic&#8212;by nearly 10 seconds. It appears some reshuffling of the rankings is in order, as Will Porter\'s Yale squad is showing some familiar midseason speed and seems to be in great shape with the conference championships looming&#8212;but they weren\'t the only ones looking in top form. \n \n More race video from the weekend: \n \nThe Harvard heavyweight men continued their undefeated ways, winning in dominant fashion over Navy and Penn . Meanwhile, on Carnegie Lake, the Crimson lightweight squad also scored a double-victory over Princeton and Yale to win the Goldthwait and Vogel Cups , and the Princeton open women defeated Dartmouth, Tennessee, and Penn on home waters. \n \nOver at Mercer, John Graves and Elle Logan were making clear their intentions for the 2013 international racing season, winning the men\'s and women\'s open singles (video of the finals here ). In the men\'s pair, it was the famous ( infamous? ) Henrik Rummel continuing to show that he\'s excited about rowing, winning the event with partner and UC Davis alumnus Seth Weil .

The head preacher at the Church is Reverend Peter J. Gomes, Plummer Professor at Harvard and Pusey Minister in The Memorial Church. He is so moving to listen to... and so inspiring! He is the perfect preacher for a congregation of skeptical academics! ;)\r\n\r\nWe had our wedding ceremony at the Memorial Church, which was just stunning. The building itself is absolutely gorgeous. We got many compliments from our guests about that. Since my Husband is a graduate student at the school, we received a deep discount to use the facilities. I believe you can still have special services there for people not related to the University, but there is more of a cost involved. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n    Was this review helpful to you?

The Game is played in November at the end of the football season, with the venue alternating between Harvard Stadium and the Yale Bowl . Through the 2012 game, Yale leads the series 65\xe2\x80\x9356\xe2\x80\x938. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Series history \n 2 Significance \n 3 Notable games \n \n 3.1 First tie: 1879 \n 3.2 Harvard Beats Yale, 29\xe2\x80\x9329 \n 3.3 First overtime game: 2005 \n \n \n 4 Pranks \n 5 Tailgate \n 6 Bulldog legend \n 7 See also \n 8 References \n 9 Bibliography \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Series history \n See also: List of Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football games \n The first meeting between the teams occurred on November 13, 1875, at Hamilton Field in New Haven . Harvard won 4\xe2\x80\x930 by scoring four touchdowns and four field goals (at the time, a touchdown merely gave the scoring team the opportunity to gain one point by converting the field goal). At the time, the sport of American football was still evolving from rugby . \n The rules that governed the early years of The Game were a modified version of the rules of rugby and made the game particularly brutal. In the second half of The Game of 1892, Harvard introduced the flying wedge formation, devised by chess master Lorin F. Deland, which so devastated Yale players that it was outlawed the following season (nevertheless, Yale won 6\xe2\x80\x930). Between 1890 and 1894, The Game was played on neutral territory in Hampden Park, Springfield, MA (roughly halfway between Cambridge and New Haven). After The Game of 1894, which came to be known as the "Hampden Park Bloodbath" and about which newspapers reported seven players carried off the field "in dying condition," the two schools broke off all official contact including athletic competition for two years. Since resuming in 1897 at Harvard, The Game has been played annually, except during World War I and World War II , alternating between Cambridge and New Haven. \n The first known reference to "The Game" occurs in an 1898 letter by former Harvard captain A. Holden (class of 1888) to Harvard coach Cam Forbes on the occasion of The Game being permanently moved to the end of the season (" it also makes the Yale\xe2\x80\x93Harvard game the last game of the season "). But public capitalized reference to The Game appears to have been first made by syndicated sports columnist Red Smith . In 1959, he called a Yale athletics official at the time, Charlie Loftus, to say he wouldn\'t be able to make that year\'s Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football match. Loftus disbelievingly replied, "What? You\'re going to miss \'The Game.\'" Although Smith\'s absence went largely unnoticed at the game that year, his column did not. In that week\'s paper, Smith "borrowed" the sobriquet from Loftus\' comment and christened the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry football match "The Game" for good. The name clinched its legendary foothold when, the following year, Harvard Sports Information Director Baron Pittenger mantled the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale game program with the respective title, and that made the name stick. [ 1 ] \n Since Tim Murphy\'s arrival as Head Coach of Harvard for the 1994 season, Harvard has dominated the series, going 14\xe2\x80\x935, including 11 of the last 12 through 2012. This makes Murphy the winningest coach in the long series. Yale\'s sole win during the past decade was in 2006. Murphy can also boast of two undefeated and untied teams during this streak, while Yale\'s last unbeaten/untied season was in 1931. Harvard\'s current six-game streak is tied (with Yale\'s 1902\xe2\x80\x9307 six-game streak) for the second longest winning streak of the series behind Yale\'s 1880\xe2\x80\x931889 eight-game streak. \n Harvard has been the better "spoiler" between the two teams. Over the past century, of the ten times Yale entered The Game undefeated, it exited the game victorious only once, while Harvard "upset" the Bulldogs on seven occasions: 1912, 1921, 1937, 1968 (with the infamous 29\xe2\x80\x9329 "tie"), 1974, 1979 and 2007. Over the same period of time, Harvard has arrived at The Game undefeated nine times, triumphing all but once (1931). \n The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry is the second oldest continuing rivalry and also the third most-played rivalry game in college football history, after the Lehigh \xe2\x80\x93 Lafayette Rivalry (1884) and the Princeton \xe2\x80\x93Yale game (1873). As of 2012, the Harvard Crimson and Yale Bulldogs have met 129 times since the first game in 1875. \n [ edit ] Significance \n For many students and alumni of Harvard and Yale, The Game is an important event. The schools are located only a few hours\' travel from one another; and, perhaps because they are among the nation\'s most prestigious and oldest universities, the rivalry is intense. Beating the rival is often considered more important than the team\'s season record. Since 1900, the Game has been the final game of the season for both teams, since Ivy League schools do not participate in post-season football games (the one exception occurring in 1919, when Harvard beat Yale 3\xe2\x80\x930 and then went on to the 1920 Rose Bowl Game , in which they defeated Oregon 7\xe2\x80\x936). \n \n \n \n  \nHalf-time festivities at The Game, Yale Bowl . \n \n \n The Game is significant for historical reasons in that the first game of the rivalry (in November 1875) was the second American football game played between U.S. colleges featuring a ball-carrying form of the game (the first being a Harvard-Tufts football match that occurred in June 1875). The rules of that game soon were adopted by other schools, such as Rutgers and Princeton, which had been playing soccer (i.e., Association Football ) since 1869, and American football quickly became the archetypal college sport. The schools that would become the Ivy League played the leading role in the development of American football in the late 19th century; football\'s rules, conventions, and equipment, as well as elements of "atmosphere" such as the mascot and fight song , include many elements pioneered or nurtured at Harvard and Yale. For many years, The Game was also likely to determine the Ivy League championship. The Game receives less national attention today; most college football fans are more interested in games between larger institutions whose teams are made up of scholarship athletes, many of them bound for professional careers. The high attendance at Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl for the contest testify that The Game still generates interest beyond the respective campuses and alumni bodies; tickets for The Game generally sell out even in modern times when The Game is played at Harvard, as Harvard Stadium\'s seating capacity is less than half that of the Yale Bowl. \n In 2003, Sports Illustrated magazine ("On Campus" edition) rated the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry as the sixth-best in college athletics. \n [ edit ] Notable games \n [ edit ] First tie: 1879 \n The game played on November 8, 1879 ended in a scoreless tie , the first of eight ties in the series. \n [ edit ] Harvard Beats Yale, 29\xe2\x80\x9329 \n \n See 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game \n \n In 1968, the Harvard team made a miraculous last-moment comeback by scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie a highly touted Yale squad. Yale had a 16-game winning streak and both teams were undefeated for the season at 8\xe2\x80\x930 coming into the game. \n The tie left both teams 8\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 for the season, inspiring The Harvard Crimson to print the headline " Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29 ". [ 2 ] This headline was later used as the title for a 2008 documentary about this Game directed by Kevin Rafferty . [ 3 ] \n This game stands as the final tie in the series, as subsequent rule changes have eliminated ties from college football. [ 4 ] \n [ edit ] First overtime game: 2005 \n On November 19, 2005, Harvard defeated Yale in the rivalry\'s first overtime matchup. Harvard won by a score of 30\xe2\x80\x9324 after three overtime periods. \n [ edit ] Pranks \n The Game is an inviting target for pranksters. For example, in 1961 in New Haven, The Harvard Crimson student newspaper distributed a parody of The Yale Daily News with a headline saying that President Kennedy would attend. At the Bowl, the President of the Crimson ( Robert Ellis Smith ) donned a mask of President Kennedy, had friends dressed as a Secret Service man and a military aide, and walked on the field before the game as the Harvard Band played " Hail to the Chief ". Thousands of early arrivals and sports writers were fooled by the prank. President Kennedy, a Harvard graduate, was listening to the game on the radio in Hyannisport, according to later news reports. \n Prior to The Game in 1933, Handsome Dan II, Yale\'s bulldog mascot, was kidnapped (allegedly by members of the Harvard Lampoon ). Then, the morning after a 19\xe2\x80\x936 upset by Harvard over Yale, after hamburger was smeared on the feet of the statue of John Harvard that sits in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard \xe2\x80\x93 a photo was snapped of Handsome Dan licking John Harvard\'s feet. The photo ran on the front page of papers throughout the country. [ 5 ] \n In 1962, Harvard Band members marched through New Haven, playing their instruments at 3 a.m. much to the chagrin of the New Haven police. \n MIT "Hacks" [ 6 ] \nPerhaps the most famous exploit was carried out at Harvard Stadium during the second quarter in 1982, when a Harvard score was immediately followed by a huge black weather balloon , previously installed under the 45 yard line by students from MIT as the letters painted on its side proclaimed, slowly inflating until it exploded, spraying talcum powder over the field (Harvard won, 45\xe2\x80\x937). \n For the 2006 Game, MIT students secretly replaced the "VE-RI-TAS" insignia on the Harvard Stadium Scoreboard with an insignia that read "HU-GE-EGO". \n On November 18, 1990, during the third quarter of The Game, MIT students carried out a less surreptitious assault. As a kicker prepared for a field goal, a rocket shot from the field over the goal posts, hanging an MIT banner. The rocket was launched using 480 feet of wire that ran underneath the field. A headline the next day in the Boston Herald read, "MIT 1 \xe2\x80\x94 Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale 0; Tech Pranksters Steal the Show" (although Yale won the actual football game, 34\xe2\x80\x9319). \n In 2006, two streakers with MIT painted on their bodies attempted to run around the field during the game. One made it the length of the field before being caught and dragged off the field; the other was tackled by security about ten steps out of the stands. \n \nDuring the pregame show in 1992, the Harvard marching band attempted to "X-out" [ clarification needed ] the Yale Precision Marching Band while the Yale band stood in its traditional Y formation; however, the Yale band caught wind of this plan and, as the Harvard band marched onto the field, shifted its formation into a large H, thus making Harvard X itself out. [ citation needed ] \n In 2004, Yale students handed out placards to some 1,800 adult Harvard fans; when raised, the signs spelled out " WE SUCK ". Harvard won that game 35\xe2\x80\x933. \n In 2012, the Game was hosted at Harvard University. During tailgate the Yale prank group the Pundits had an anti-Harvard banner skywritten via plane. \n [ edit ] Tailgate \n The Game has also become known for the large, joint Harvard-Yale tailgate parties that run throughout The Game in the fields next to the host stadium every year. The tailgate party was even televised by ESPN in 2004. While most alumni who travel to The Game actually watch it in the stadium, most students and recent alumni treat the tailgate as their primary destination. The tailgate attracts thousands of students and has recently roused the concern of the Boston Police Department , who have cracked down on underage drinking at the student tailgates, as well as moving it further away from the stadium and reducing the space available. [ 7 ] This included requiring, in 2008, that all tailgates end at halftime, leading Yale students to shift most of their tailgating to the Princeton game, held the previous week in New Haven. \n In 2011, a tailgater was killed from a U-Haul truck collision. [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Bulldog legend \n Apocryphal tales assert that before the 1908 Game, Harvard coach Percy Haughton strangled a bulldog to death in the locker room to motivate his players. Research has indicated that there were no contemporary reports of this incident \xe2\x80\x93 and later accounts suggest that Haughton had created a Bulldog doll and had strangled that. In addition, these reports indicate that he had attached the doll to his car and drove around town dragging the doll. Whatever the facts are, Harvard did win the 1908 game, 4\xe2\x80\x930, the culmination of a 9\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 national championship season.

As part of your coursework , or perhaps as part of individual\r\nresearch opportunities working with professors , you will have the\r\nchance to undertake some extraordinary projects covering topics ranging\r\nfrom bioengineering to cryptography to environmental engineering. \r\n Our dedicated undergraduate research facilities and Teaching Labs also provide opportunities for students to engage in hands-on learning. We encourage undergraduates from all relevant concentrations to\r\ntackle projects during the academic year and/or over the summer. \r\n Keep\r\nin mind, many students also pursue research at private companies and\r\nlabs as well as at government institutions like the National Institutes\r\nof Health. \r\n If you have any questions, please contact or stop by the Student Affairs Office , located in Pierce Hall, 110. \r\n Opportunities \n \r\n \r\nSEAS Teaching Labs \n \r\n The SEAS Teaching Labs provide support for courses and independent workshops with a fundamental focus on hands-on research. \r\n View the slideshow \r\n Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE) \r\n Program for Research in Science and Engineering (PRISE) is a 10-week summer residential community of undergraduates\r\nparticipating in research.

The two universities regularly battle for the top spot on college rankings and claim some of the most powerful alumni networks in the world. \r\n But which school is really better? \r\n To answer the question we compared them across six categories &mdash; cost, academics, job prospects, campus, student body, and student life &mdash; which together describe everything that should go into one\'s college choice. \r\n Here\'s what we found: \r\n Cost \r\n Annual tuition including room, board and personal expenses at Harvard costs $57,950 , while Yale costs $58,600 &mdash; a slight edge for Harvard but not much of a difference. When you factor in financial aid, however, Harvard still comes out ahead. At Harvard, about 60 percent of undergrads receive about $182 million in need-based financial aid , while at Yale approximately 55 percent of undergrads receive $120 million in need-based financial aid . At both schools, students whose families earn under $65,000 per year can qualify for financial aid. \r\n Harvard has a slight advantage in cost. \r\n Academics \r\n Harvard and Yale are both elite institutions that offer world-class academics. \r\n Both schools stress the importance of a balanced liberal arts education. Harvard has a Core Curriculum , which requires students to take a variety of classes. Yale\'s distributional requirements mean that students have to take classes in certain categories like the humanities, social science, and natural science. Both schools have strong economics and political science programs. Yale excels in drama and the arts, while Harvard is arguably slightly stronger in the sciences. \r\n Harvard offers about 3,900 courses and more than 40 majors for undergrads. Yale offers 2,000 courses and more than 75 majors . Let\'s call that a tie. \r\n Both schools have world-renowned faculty members and a similar faculty-to-student ratio. (Harvard has a 7:1 ratio and Yale has a 6:1 ratio.) At Harvard, 78 percent of classes have fewer than 20 students , while at Yale 72 percent of classes have fewer than 20 students , according to the US News &amp; World Report. Again it\'s a wash. \r\n  REUTERS/Brian Snyder The statue of John Harvard sits in Harvard Yard \r\n Harvard has 47 Nobel Laureates who are faculty or alumni , while Yale counts 25 Nobel Laureates among its faculty and alumni . Harvard faculty or alumni have won a total of 47 Pulitzer Prizes , while Yale comes out ahead with a total of 56 Pulitzer Prizes awarded to faculty and alumni. \r\n Students who rate professors on Ratemyprofessors.com gave Harvard professors an average rating of 3.84 and Yale professors an average rating of 3.8 &mdash;a nominal difference. \r\n In short, the schools are about equal, with similar course offerings, class sizes and high-quality professors and alumni. \r\n Academics are a tie. \r\n Job Prospects \r\n Both Harvard and Yale have strong brand recognition that almost guarantees jobs for future students, but one school appears to have an advantage. \r\n Harvard grads will earn slightly more money. According to PayScale, the average starting salary for Harvard grads is $50,700 , while the average starting salary for Yale grads is $48,900 . The mid-career salary for Harvard grads is $111,000, while the mid-career salary for Yale grads is $105,000, according to PayScale . \r\n In our poll to determine the 50 Best Colleges in America &mdash; which focused on future job prospects &mdash; Harvard was ranked the the number three school in the country, while Yale came in behind at number four. Similarly, the Times Higher Education ranking of universities by reputation gave Harvard the number one spot last year, while Yale came in at number 10. \r\n   Flickr/Adam Jones, Ph.D. - Global Photo Archive As for alumni networks, another critical factor in getting a job, both schools are excellent. Eight U.S. Presidents graduated from Harvard, while only five graduated from Yale. Twenty U.S. Supreme Court Justices attended Harvard , while 10 Justices attended Yale. \r\n According to US News, Harvard topped the list of 2012 Fortune 500 CEO degree granters with 65 total degrees. Yale didn\'t even make the list of the top 13 schools for CEOs. \r\n Harvard\'s notable contemporary alumni include CEOs and financial bigwigs like Lloyd Blankfein and Ben Bernanke ; foreign leaders like Mexico\'s Felipe Calderon; and actors like Ashley Judd and Natalie Portman. Yale\'s include writers like Harold Bloom and Tom Wolfe; actors like Paul Newman and Meryl Streep; and political figures like Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney. \r\n The bottom line: Both schools have strong alumni networks and brand recognition that will land students great jobs, but Harvard takes the lead in brand value. \r\n Harvard has a slight advantage in job prospects. \r\n Campus \r\n Harvard is located in Cambridge, Mass., a bustling district outside of Boston that\'s been called one of the best communities for young people and the healthiest city in America by Self magazine. \r\n Yale is in downtown New Haven, Conn., which has a reputation for having some unsafe neighborhoods. But the area surrounding the college is filled with shops, restaurants, and bars, and students feel right at home there. \r\n When it comes to architecture, it\'s tough to pick one over the other. Both Harvard Yard and Yale\'s campus are known for their centuries-old stone buildings, leafy quads, and high-tech laboratories. Harvard\'s libraries hold around 17 million volumes, while Yale\'s have 12.99 million. \r\n Neither college has a central undergraduate student center, though Harvard students launched a campaign to build one in 2011. \r\n Both have great athletic facilities: Yale\'s 9-story Payne Whitney Gymnasium has training centers for crew, gymnastics, swimming, and a state-of-the-art fencing salon, while Harvard\'s 5-floor Malkin Athletic Center has three pools, a cycling studio, and two cardio rooms. \r\n As for future spending, Harvard has the largest endowment in the world at $30.7 billion . Yale\'s endowment is still impressive but not as high at $19.3 billion . \r\n While students on both campuses are satisfied with their surroundings, we\'ll give Harvard the edge for its cool neighborhood, proximity to Boston, and the classic beauty of Harvard Yard. \r\n Harvard has a slight advantage in campus. \r\n Student Body \r\n Yale and Harvard are two of the most competitive schools in the world . Yale admitted 6.7 percent of applicants for the class of 2017, while Harvard accepted 5.8 percent, giving Harvard the slight edge. \r\n Both colleges have also admitted an increasingly diverse group of students in recent years. For the class of 2016, Harvard\'s admitted students were 21 percent Asian American, 10 percent African American, and 11 percent Hispanic or Latino , while Yale\'s were 21 .1 percent Asian American, 9.5 percent African American, and 10.5 percent Hispanic. \r\n  Harry How/Getty Images Student reviewers on College Prowler gave both schools an A+ for diversity. \r\n Yale\'s average SAT score is slightly higher than Harvard\'s. The SAT range at Yale is 2120-2390, compared to Harvard\'s 2080-2380, according to College Prowler. \r\n Both schools have standout students within their current undergraduate ranks. Harvard\'s include undergrads who are making strides towards curing cancer and have played at Carnegie Hall, and even the daughter of the head of China\'s Communist party . \r\n Yale\'s student body includes Rhodes Scholars, entrepreneurs, a composer of classical music, and a professional magician. \r\n Harvard\'s undergraduate student body is slightly larger at around 6,650, compared to Yale\'s 5,322. \r\n Both schools fared well, but we\'ll give Harvard the category for its slightly lower admission rate &mdash; when you\'re talking single-digit percentages, one percent matters. \r\n Harvard has a slight advantage in student body. \r\n Student Life \r\n Both colleges offer tons of extracurriculars and vibrant social scenes for undergraduate students. Yale\'s student life revolves around the residential college system, in which incoming freshmen are assigned to one of 12 residential colleges, where many students live, eat, and make their closest friends. \r\n Harvard also has a house system. Freshmen live in dorms and join one of 12 houses at their end of their first year. Houses also have dorm rooms, dining halls, and common spaces. \r\n  Northfoto / Shutterstock.com \r\n Harvard does not have a formal Greek system, but its eight all-male "final" clubs serve a similar social purpose. Around 10 percent of Yalies participate in Greek life. Fifty percent of seniors are also members of the school\'s famous "secret societies." \r\n Both schools offer tons of extracurriculars: Yale has more than 400 organizations on campus, including over 50 performance groups and 60 cultural associations. Harvard also has more than 400 campus organizations for students with any interest under the sun. \r\n When it comes to the dining halls, Harvard has Yale beat; Harvard, with 13 undergrad dining halls, ranked #12 on The Daily Meal \'s latest list of the best colleges for food, while Yale was #21. \r\n But Yale bests Harvard when it comes to nightlife. College Prowler\'s reviewers gave Yale\'s nightlife an A+ for its variety, from campus-wide theme parties to frat parties to the dance floor at local nightclub Toad\'s. Harvard, where nightlife is centered around the finals clubs and local bars, got an A. \r\n Overall, Yale seems to be a happier place to be. According to The Daily Beast\'s latest ranking of the happiest colleges &mdash; based on student opinion data and retention rates &mdash; Harvard ranked #11 and Yale was #3. \r\n This one was almost too close to call. Both offer tons of clubs, ways to socialize, and house systems. But since Yale ranked higher in terms of nightlife and student happiness, we\'ll give it the edge in this category. \r\n Yale has a slight advantage in student life. \r\n THE WINNER \r\n While both universities are excellent, Harvard is the winner, coming out slightly ahead in cost, job prospects, campus, and student body. \n       \n        \n      SEE ALSO: \n      25 Colleges Where The Students Are Hot And Smart \n     \n        \n      SEE ALSO: \n      America\'s Most Intense Colleges \n     \n      \n \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n \n\n   \n\n     \n \n  Recommended For You \n  \n     \n    \n      \n     \n    \n    \n      \n     \n    \n    \n      \n     \n    \n       \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n \n  \n    \t \n  How The Owner Of BabyCakes Came To Dominate The Gluten-Free Market \n  \n     \n    \n   \n    Now in three cities and looking to expand.  \n \n \t\n\t\t Please follow The Life on Twitter and Facebook .\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tFollow Jennifer Polland on\n\t\t\t\t Twitter .\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  \n  Tags: \n      College ,      Harvard ,      Yale     |\n      Get Alerts for these topics &#187; \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t Advertisement: \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n \n\t \n\t \n\n\t \n\t\t\n \n    \n    \n     Short URL \n     \n    \n   \n \n Share:\n \t\t \n \n\n \n  \n   \n     Twitter \n   \n   \n     Facebook \n   \n   \n     Digg \n   \n   \n     StumbleUpon \n   \n   \n     Reddit \n   \n   \n     LinkedIn \n   \n   \n     Google+ \n   \n   \n     Email \n   \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t More about embedding posts &#187; \n\t\t\t\t  Embed \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n  \n   \n    More about Alerts &#187; \n         Alerts \n      \n   \n     Newsletter \n   \n\t\t \n  \n \n\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t To embed this post, copy the code below and paste into your website or blog. \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 600px wide (preview) \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=515b514eecad04cf75000000&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 400px wide (preview) \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=515b514eecad04cf75000000&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t 300px wide (preview) \n\t\t\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t\t\t &lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/embed?id=515b514eecad04cf75000000&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=430&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;430&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; \n\t\t\t\t   \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\n\n\t\n\n\t \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Blackboard Home &#187; \n\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t Harvard University \t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Summary \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHarvard is a private University located in Cambridge, Mass.

The Bulldogs and Crimson will be pitted against athletes from Cambridge and Oxford in the 44 th biennial meet of its kind. The competition is the oldest international series; it began in 1899, two years before the modern day Olympics. The meet is held every two years at alternating locations in both countries. This year, the four teams will compete in Boston at Harvard's McCurdy Track. In addition to taking the meet the last time it was held, the teams from the two Ivy League schools have triumphed over their English rivals a majority of years. The meet uses traditional British scoring, meaning the first-place finisher in each event will score one point for his/her team. \n Though traditional medals are awarded at the meet, four additional prizes are also recognized. The Naughton Trophy is presented to the winning set of teams, while the Achilles Trophy is awarded to the winning men's teams and the Stead-Stellers Trophy to the women's. Moreover, the team coaches have the opportunity to select an outstanding male and female performer of the meet and honor him/her with the Pat Liles Outstanding Performer Award. Finally, the Boal Hammer Award will be given to the winner of the hammer throw event. \n In creating the combined Harvard-Yale team, the Bulldogs will contribute 12 athletes. Four middle and long distance runners&mdash; sophomore Kira Garry , senior Nihal Kayali , sophomore Shannon McDonnell and freshman Emily Stark &mdash;will take to the track. Garry will participate in the 3,000-meter steeplechase, Kayali in the 1,500-meter run, McDonnell in the 800-meter run, and Stark in the 5,000-meter run. Sophomore Emily Cable will likely take on the 4x400-meter relay, as well as the long jump alongside junior Amanda Snajder . In addition, senior captain Allison Rue will represent her school in the 400-meter dash. \n Senior Jenna Poggi will represent Yale as its sole hurdler, racing in the 400-meter hurdles, while junior Emily Urciuoli is set to show off her prowess in the pole vault. \n Moreover, sophomore Alisha Jordan and freshman Megan Toon will both compete in the jumping events, with Jordan competing in the triple jump and Toon in the high jump. Finally, freshman Karleh Wilson will have the chance to show her abilities in the throwing events, as she will likely prove a contender to beat in the shot put, discus throw, and hammer throw. \n The meet will begin at 3:00 p.m. on Tuesday with the hammer throw and 4x100-meter relay. The meet program, including entry list and schedule of events, can be found here . Results will be posted on yalebulldogs.com when available. \n Report by Maria Seravalli '16, Yale Sports Publicity \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Contact\nUs \n\n RSS Feed \n\nCopyright &copy; 2010 \n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n View: Mobile | Desktop"

Das , CRIMSON STAFF WRITER \n   5 days ago \n   \n    \n     \n      18 comments \n    \n    \n     Email \n    \n    Print \n    \n     \n     \n      \n      \n      \n     \n    \n   \n  \n    \n     \n      \n     \n     \n      Christine E Mansour \n     \n     \n     Students Question the Amnesty Policy\n     \n    \n  \n   \n   \n   \n   \n     Tucked in an alley between Holyoke Street and Dunster Street, the after-hours entrance to Harvard University Health Services has been a destination for students seeking medical help for their intoxicated friends. Administrators say that Harvard University\xe2\x80\x99s alcohol policy, which guarantees that students who go to or take others to UHS for medical treatment stemming from alcohol or drug use will not be punished, is designed to encourage students to place health and safety above all else. But for some students, the repercussions of an alcohol-related UHS trip carry over beyond the hospital visit itself\xe2\x80\x94causing them and others to question whether they should make the trip to after-hours at all. Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9camnesty policy\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94first implemented in 2007 and reaffirmed in last March\xe2\x80\x99s revised College-wide alcohol policy\xe2\x80\x94states that students seeking medical treatment for alcohol or drug-related illnesses for themselves or a friend will not face disciplinary actions for any illegal substance use, according to the Harvard University Student Handbook. For administrators, a concern about student health is the underlying premise of the policy. \n    \n     \n    \n     \xe2\x80\x9cThe important thing about the amnesty policy is that the health of members of the Harvard community is paramount, and so the prospect of disciplinary action should never keep someone from seeking help on behalf of friends or for themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivy Yard Dean William Cooper \xe2\x80\x9994 wrote in an email. However, the amnesty policy was also designed to take patterns of behavior\xe2\x80\x94often seen in multiple late-night visits to UHS\xe2\x80\x94into account, and it is this underlying concern over less formal disciplinary measures that some say limits the efficacy of the policy. Potential repercussions after repeated health incidents involving drugs or alcohol can include a warning by a House Master or Dean, admonishment by the Administrative Board, and, eventually, probation or requirement to temporarily withdraw from the College. For example, after a student\xe2\x80\x99s second transport to UHS, the Freshman Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Office draws up a contract outlining, on a case by case basis, the College\xe2\x80\x99s expectations for how he or she will avoid dangerous drinking in the future. At this second meeting, the deans also encourage students to contact their parents about the incidents to arrange a follow-up conversation between administrators and the parents. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the contract it\xe2\x80\x99s not really meant to be \xe2\x80\x98Got you!\xe2\x80\x99 If you\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to meet the terms, we have serious concerns about how you\xe2\x80\x99re taking care of yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman \xe2\x80\x9967. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to stay through the rest of this year, you cannot be drinking and you cannot find yourself in similar circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d Some students interviewed for this story said they have taken advantage of the policy in order to get their friends treated. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking back at the one time I did have to take a friend to UHS, it was more based on the impulse of making sure that that friend was safe and was in good hands,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jenny Choi \xe2\x80\x9916. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not feel prepared enough to be able to take care of that friend.\xe2\x80\x9d Several others, however, said that the policy\xe2\x80\x94along with the prospect of further meetings with deans and parents\xe2\x80\x94may be a deterrent in deciding whether to seek help. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a thought of, \xe2\x80\x98Why bring them to UHS if I can take care of them better myself?\xe2\x80\x99 That way they have no disciplinary issues to deal with,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam O. Brodheim \xe2\x80\x9916. Juan E. Bedoya \xe2\x80\x9916 said that he has taken care of several friends who were inebriated, but chose not to take them to University Health Services because of the potential awkwardness of talking to an administrator after an incident relating to alcohol. Another freshman, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson to protect her roommate\xe2\x80\x99s privacy, said she has been hesitant to use UHS after her roommate\xe2\x80\x99s second trip to Stillman Infirmary. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dean in our Yard gave her the ultimatum that if she had to go one more time there would be serious repercussions,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo even though she has abused alcohol in a scary and dangerous way since then, my friends and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take her to UHS because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the reason she gets asked to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94Staff writer Indrani G.

The gift from\xc2\xa0Blavatnik Family Foundation will be used to launch a program called\xc2\xa0Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator at Harvard University to identify promising technologies in medical science and license them to companies. \n  \n The gift strengthens Harvard&#8217;s commitment to create an entrepreneurial culture in life sciences. Harvard said in a statement that the funds will be used to identify highly promising technologies, boost their value, and prepare them for commercial development and licensing. It comes at a time when researchers are facing a tough time due to cuts in federal funding. Last week, Harvard Medical School announced that it was forced to close its 50-year old primate research facility in Southborough due to economic pressures. \n The Cambridge, Massachusets-based institution will also fund a fellowship to give MBA students some experience in life sciences. Educational institutions have increasingly become the center of marketable ideas and products, especially in the medical science industry. According to the Office of Technology Department, Harvard University received $11.5 million in licensing fees last year. \n \n \r\n\r\n\r\n \n \n\n Harvard&#8217;s chief technology development officer\xc2\xa0Isaac Kohlberg said in a statement that some of the most important discoveries that exist today have come from alliances between the life science industry and academia.\xc2\xa0Len Blavatnik, MBA &#8217;89, has been a long-time supporter of Harvard University. Blavatnik is well known for his investments in areas that connect scientific innovation with business. Through\xc2\xa0Blavatnik Family Foundation, he earlier supported Harvard&#8217;s original Biomedical Accelerator Fund in 2007. \n Established in 1636, Harvard is the world&#8217;s richest university. Its endowment fund is estimated to have $30.7 billion by the end of June 2012. Len Blavatnik is the chairman and CEO of\xc2\xa0Access Industries Holdings Inc. He also has an approximately 14 percent stake in\xc2\xa0 LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB).

Founded in 1701 in the Colony of Connecticut , the university is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States . \n Originally chartered as the "Collegiate School", the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to establish a college to train clergy and political leaders for the colony. In 1718, the College was renamed "Yale College" to honor a gift from Elihu Yale , a governor of the British East India Company . In 1861, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first U.S. institution to award the PhD. [ 4 ] Yale became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. Yale College was transformed, beginning in the 1930s, through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now exist and two more are planned. Yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and professional students . Almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. [ 5 ]  [ 6 ] \n The University\'s assets include an endowment valued at $19.4&#160;billion as of 2011 [update] , [ 7 ] the second-largest of any academic institution in the world. Yale\'s system of more than two dozen libraries holds 12.5&#160;million volumes. [ 8 ] 49 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the University as students, faculty, and staff. Yale has produced many notable alumni , including five U.S. Presidents , 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices , and several foreign heads of state. At the graduate level, Yale Law School , Yale School of Art , and Yale School of Drama are consistently ranked the top programs in their field. Yale Law School is the most selective law school in the United States. [ 9 ] \n Yale students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League .

Soon thereafter, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers: Samuel Andrew , Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather, James Noyes , James Pierpont , Abraham Pierson , Noadiah Russell , Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge , all of whom were alumni of Harvard , met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford, Connecticut , to pool their books to form the school\'s first library. [ 10 ] The group, led by James Pierpont , is now known as "The Founders". \n Originally called the "Collegiate School", the institution opened in the home of its first rector , Abraham Pierson , [ 11 ] in Killingworth (now Clinton ). The school moved to Saybrook , and then Wethersfield . In 1718 the college moved to New Haven, Connecticut . \n \n \n \n  \nFirst diploma awarded by Yale College , granted to Nathaniel Chauncey, 1702. \n \n \n Meanwhile, a rift was forming at Harvard between its sixth president Increase Mather and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity . The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not. [ 12 ] \n In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony\'s Governor Gurdon Saltonstall , Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman in Wales named Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer , Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in India as a representative of the East India Company , donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum at the time. Yale also donated 417&#160;books and a portrait of King George&#160;I . Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College in gratitude to its benefactor, and to increase the chances that he would give the college another large donation or bequest. Elihu Yale was away in India when the news of the school\'s name change reached his home in Wrexham , Wales, a trip from which he never returned. While he did ultimately leave his fortunes to the "Collegiate School within His Majesties Colony of Connecticot", [ citation needed ] the institution was never able to successfully lay claim to it. \n \n \n \n  \nOld Brick Row in 1807. \n \n \n [ edit ] Curriculum \n Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period\xe2\x80\x94the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment \xe2\x80\x94thanks to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles . They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale, while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment, and fights with the Connecticut legislature . [ 13 ] \n Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language , along with Greek and Latin , and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles , president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase \xd7\x90\xd7\x95\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d \xd7\x95\xd7\xaa\xd7\x9e\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d ( Urim and Thummim ) on the Yale seal. Stiles\' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. Fortunately, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning , Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D. , at 1803, [ 14 ] for his efforts. \n \n \n \n  \n Woolsey Hall in c. 1905 \n \n \n [ edit ] Students \n As the only college in Connecticut, Yale educated the sons of the elite. [ 15 ] Offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During the period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side. [ 16 ] \n The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753, and Brothers in Unity in 1768. [ 17 ] \n [ edit ] 19th century \n \n \n \n  \nMen leaning on the old Yale fence facing Chapel Street, c.&#160;1874. \n \n \n The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. At the same time, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. [ 18 ] At the same time a group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the \'isms\' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. [ 19 ] Perhaps the most well-remembered [ citation needed ] teacher was William Graham Sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909. He taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter , who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education, 1879\xe2\x80\x9381. Porter objected to Sumner\'s use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might intellectually, morally, and religiously harm students. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Sports and debate \n The Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th&#160;century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who regretted he had but one life to lose for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself. [ 21 ] \n Along with Harvard and Princeton , Yale students rejected elite British concepts about \'amateurism\' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football. [ 22 ] The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry began in 1875. \n \n \n \n  \nYale\'s four-oared crew team, posing with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy , won at Philadelphia . \n \n \n Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in the first intercollegiate debate, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart. [ 23 ] \n In 1909\xe2\x80\x9310, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905\xe2\x80\x9306 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries. [ 24 ] \n [ edit ] Expansion \n \n \n \n  \nConnecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753. \n \n \n Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale School of Medicine (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Sheffield Scientific School (1847), [ 25 ] and the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of Timothy Dwight&#160;V , Yale College was renamed Yale University. The university would later add the Yale School of Music (1894), the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1901), the Yale School of Public Health (1915), the Yale School of Nursing (1923), the Yale School of Drama (1955), the Yale Physician Associate Program (1973), and the Yale School of Management (1976). It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School. \n Expansion caused controversy about Yale\'s new roles. Noah Porter , moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter\'s contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. [ 26 ] He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. \n \n \n \n  \nAerial view from the south, 1906. \n \n \n [ edit ] 20th century \n [ edit ] Behavioral sciences \n Between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations , especially ones connected with the Rockefellers , contributed about $7&#160;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology . The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President James R. Angell and psychobiologist Robert M. Yerkes , tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control, sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Biology \n Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison , Grace E. Pickford , and G.&#160;Evelyn Hutchinson , and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison\'s group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford\'s and Hutchinson\'s were not. Pickford\'s group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson\'s example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research. [ 28 ] \n [ edit ] Medicine \n Milton Winternitz led the Yale Medical School as its dean from 1920 to 1935. An innovative, even maverick, leader, he not only kept the school from going under but also turned it into a first-class research institution. [ citation needed ] Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department, and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign. [ 29 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty \n Before World War&#160;II , most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions. [ 30 ] \n [ edit ] History and American Studies \n The American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. Norman Holmes Pearson , who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose. [ 31 ] Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire William R. Coe made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming. Coe was concerned to celebrate the \'values\' of the Western United States in order to meet the "threat of communism." [ 32 ] \n [ edit ] Women \n Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . [ 33 ] \n In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female, declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969. [ 34 ] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate; [ 35 ] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall . \n A decade into co-education, rampant student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale . While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale\'s Grievance Board and the Yale Women\'s Center. [ 36 ] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale. [ 37 ] \n [ edit ] Class \n Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to increase the proportion of white Protestants of notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus ), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970. [ 38 ] \n [ edit ] Town-gown relations \n Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale\'s exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven\'s efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy. [ 39 ] \n [ edit ] Yale in the 21st century \n In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students. [ 40 ] In July 2012, the Peking University-Yale University Program ended due to weak participation. [ 40 ] \n In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale\'s institutional priorities: "First, among the nation\'s finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders." [ 41 ] \n The Boston Globe wrote that "if there\'s one school that can lay claim to educating the nation\'s top national leaders over the past three decades, it\'s Yale." [ 42 ]  Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004. Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush , and major-party nominees during this period include John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Hillary Rodham Clinton (2008), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). \n Several explanations have been offered for Yale\xe2\x80\x99s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. [ 43 ] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\xe2\x80\x99s focus on creating "a laboratory for future leaders," an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster . [ 43 ]  Richard H. Brodhead , former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University , stated: "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [ 42 ] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes "an ethos of organized activity" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union \'s Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News . [ 44 ]  Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: "It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [ 45 ] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the "son and grandson of alumni", and for a "member of a politically influential family." [ 46 ]  New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others. [ 47 ] \n During the 1988 presidential election, George H.&#160;W. Bush (Yale \'48) derided Michael Dukakis for having "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard\'s boutique". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis\'s Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale\'s reputation was "so diffuse, there isn\'t a symbol, I don\'t think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said Yale did not share Harvard\'s reputation for "liberalism and elitism". [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, "In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of \'68 and the class of \'71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation". [ 50 ] \n In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location \xe2\x80\x93 the others are Britain\'s Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara \xe2\x80\x93 for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation \'s United States Faith and Globalization Initiative. [ 51 ] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, "Debating Globalization". [ 52 ] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, "Understanding Politics and Politicians." [ 53 ] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London , and both schools\xe2\x80\x99 affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care\xe2\x80\x94a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but "no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL". [ 54 ] \n Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore set to open in August 2013 as a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore. [ 55 ]  [ 56 ]  [ 57 ] \n [ edit ] Administration and organization \n The President and Fellows of Yale College , also known as the Yale Corporation , is the governing board of the University. \n Yale\'s president Richard C. Levin is one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million. [ 58 ] \n The Yale Provost\'s Office has launched several women into prominent university presidencies. In 1977 Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed acting President of Yale from this position, and went on to become President of the University of Chicago , the first woman to be full president of a major university. In 1994 Yale Provost Judith Rodin became the first female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania . In 2002 Provost Alison Richard became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cambridge . In 2004, Provost Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In 2007 Deputy Provost Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College . In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp , was appointed president of Colgate University and now heads Swarthmore College. \n In 2008 Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford. [ 59 ] Former Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead serves as the President of Duke University . \n [ edit ] Staff and labor unions \n Main article: Federation of Hospital and University Employees \n Much of Yale University\'s staff, including most maintenance staff, dining hall employees, and administrative staff, are unionized . Clerical and technical employees are represented by Local&#160;34 of Unite Here and service and maintenance workers by Local&#160;35 of the same international . Together with the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO), an unrecognized union of graduate employees, Locals&#160;34 and 35 make up the Federation of Hospital and University Employees . Also included in FHUE are the dietary workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital , who are members of 1199 SEIU . [ 60 ] In addition to these unions, officers of the Yale University Police Department are members of the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees. [ 61 ] Finally, Yale security officers voted to join the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in fall 2010 after the National Labor Relations Board ruled they could not join AFSCME ; the Yale administration contested the election. [ 62 ] \n Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes. [ 63 ] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S. [ 64 ] Yale\'s unusually large endowment exacerbates the tension over wages. Moreover, Yale has been accused of failing to treat workers with respect. [ 65 ] In a 2003 strike, however, the university claimed that more union employees were working than striking. [ 66 ] Professor David Graeber was \'retired\' after he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues. [ 67 ] \n [ edit ] Campus \n \n \n \n  \n Yale Law School . \n \n \n Yale\'s central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1&#160;km 2 ). An additional 500 acres (2.0&#160;km 2 ) includes the Yale golf course and nature preserves in rural Connecticut and Horse Island . [ 68 ] \n Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus [ 69 ] as well as for several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn \'s Yale Art Gallery [ 70 ] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen \'s Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph\'s Art &amp; Architecture Building . Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue , which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s. \n Many of Yale\'s buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness [ 71 ] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, [ 72 ] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages , and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower , 216 feet (66&#160;m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon . \n \n \n \n  \n Vanderbilt Hall at the Yale university \n \n \n Other examples of the Gothic (also called neo-Gothic and collegiate Gothic) style are on Old Campus by such architects as Henry Austin , Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis . Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family , including Vanderbilt Hall, [ 73 ] Phelps Hall, [ 74 ]  St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt ), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College , the largest residential college. [ 75 ] \n \n \n \n  \nStatue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall \n \n \n The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style . Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College , Pierson College , and Davenport College , except the latter\'s east, York Street fa\xc3\xa7ade, which was constructed in the Gothic style . \n The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library , designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill , is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. [ 76 ] It is located near the center of the University in Hewitt Quadrangle , which is now more commonly referred to as " Beinecke Plaza ". \n The library\'s six-story above-ground tower of book stacks is surrounded by a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark. \n \n \n \n  \n Interior of Beinecke Library . \n \n \n The sculptures in the sunken courtyard by Isamu Noguchi are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube). \n Alumnus Eero Saarinen , Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St.&#160;Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink at Yale and the newest residential colleges of Ezra Stiles and Morse. These latter were modelled after the medieval Italian hilltown of San Gimignano \xe2\x80\x93 a prototype chosen for the town\'s pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers. These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college\'s many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas. [ 77 ] \n Yale\'s Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale. [ 78 ] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges. [ 79 ] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification. [ 80 ] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls. [ 81 ] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute\xe2\x80\x99s College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \xe2\x80\x9cB+\xe2\x80\x9d grade overall. [ 82 ] \n \n Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven \n Marsh Botanical Garden \n Yale Sustainable Food Project Farm \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n [ edit ] Notable nonresidential campus buildings \n Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel , Beinecke Rare Book Library , Harkness Tower , Ingalls Rink , Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories , Payne Whitney Gymnasium , Peabody Museum of Natural History , Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings , Sterling Memorial Library , Woolsey Hall , Yale Center for British Art , Yale University Art Gallery , and Yale Art &amp; Architecture Building . \n Yale\'s secret society buildings (some of which are called "tombs") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius , Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake , Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu , architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain , in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold ; Manuscript Society , King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key , Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869\xe2\x80\x9370); Skull and Bones , possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo , (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison , 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf\'s Head , Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (erected 1923-4). \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Starr Reading Room \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harkness Tower \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Library Circulation Desk \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Memorial Chapel on Yale\'s Old Campus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Yale School of Management \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale School of Architecture \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale School of Forestry \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Connecticut Hall \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale Peabody Museum \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Yale Bowl \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Campus safety \n In addition to the Yale University Police Department, founded in 1894, [ 83 ] a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort , and a shuttle service. [ 84 ] \n In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale\'s student and faculty recruiting efforts. [ 85 ] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven\'s crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven police and Yale\'s campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools. [ 86 ] Nonetheless, across the board, the city of New Haven has retained the highest levels of crime of any Ivy League city for more than a decade. [ 87 ] \n Between 2002 and 2004, Yale reported 14 violent crimes ( homicide , aggravated assault , or sex offenses ); in comparison, Harvard reported 83 such incidents, Princeton 24, and Stanford 54. The incidence of nonviolent crime ( burglary , arson , and motor vehicle theft ) was also lower than most of its peer schools. \n In 2004 a national non-profit watchdog group called Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S.&#160;Department of Education , accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults. [ 88 ]  [ 89 ] \n [ edit ] Academics \n [ edit ] Admissions \n \n \n \n  \nYale University\'s Sterling Memorial Library , as seen from Maya Lin\'s sculpture, Women\'s Table . The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. \n \n \n For the Class of 2017, Yale accepted 1,991 students out of a record 29,610 total applications, hitting a record-low acceptance rate of 6.7%. [ 90 ] \n Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2016 was $41,320. Over 10% of students in Yale College are expected to have $0 parental contribution. [ 91 ] \n Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 30% are minorities , and 8% are international students . Fifty-five percent attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools. [ 92 ] In addition, Yale College admits a small group of non-traditional students each year, through the Eli Whitney Students Program . \n [ edit ] Collections \n \n \n \n  \n The Night Caf\xc3\xa9 , Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery . \n \n \n Yale University Library , which holds over 12 million volumes, is the second-largest university collection in the United States. [ 93 ] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library , contains about 4&#160;million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. \n Rare books are found in a number of Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th\xe2\x80\x91century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club , technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. \n Yale\'s museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery is the country\'s first university-affiliated art museum. It contains more than 180,000 works, including old masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn \'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art , the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. \n The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments , affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least well-known of Yale\'s collections, because its hours of opening are restricted. \n The museums also house the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 \xe2\x80\x93 when the removal of such artifacts was legal. Peru would now like to have the items returned; Yale has so far declined. [ 94 ] In November 2010, a Yale University representative agreed to return the artifacts to a Peruvian university.

[ 103 ] It was ranked fourth in the 2011 QS&#160;World University Rankings and tenth in the 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings . [ 104 ]  [ 105 ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University\xe2\x80\x99s Academic Ranking of World Universities , placed Yale at 11 in 2010.

[ 106 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions \n The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League. [ 107 ] \n Yale\'s English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren , W.K. Wimsatt , and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction . Jacques Derrida , the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called " Yale School ". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J.&#160;Hillis Miller , Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale\'s history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C.&#160;Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery , a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale\'s Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&#160;century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. \n Since summer 2010, Yale has also been host to Yale Publishing Course . \n [ edit ] Campus life \n Yale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates , or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 freshman class, 10% are non\xe2\x80\x91U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools. [ 108 ] Yale is also an open campus for the gay community . [ 109 ]  [ 110 ] Its active LGBT community first received wide publicity in the late 1980s, when Yale obtained a reputation as the "gay Ivy", due largely to a 1987 Wall Street Journal article written by Julie V. Iovine, an alumna and the spouse of a Yale faculty member. During the same year, the University hosted a national conference on gay and lesbian studies and established the Lesbian and Gay Studies Center. [ 111 ] The slogan "One in Four, Maybe More" was coined by the campus gay community. While the community in the 1980s and early 1990s was very activist, today most LGBT events have become part of the general campus social scene. [ 112 ] For example, the annual LGBT Co-op Dance attracts straight as well as gay students. \n [ edit ] Residential colleges \n Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University \n Yale has a system of 12 residential colleges , instituted in 1933 through a grant by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness , who admired the college systems at Oxford and Cambridge. Each college has a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows. Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, a commons room, meeting rooms/classrooms, and a dining hall; in addition some have chapels, libraries, squash courts, pool tables, short order dining counters, cafes, or darkrooms. Each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas, and most of them are open to students from other residential colleges. However, Yale remains a unitary university, while Oxford and Cambridge colleges are self-governed charitable institutions in their own right. \n All of Yale\'s 2,000 undergraduate courses are open to members of any college. \n The dominant architecture of the residential colleges is Neo-Gothic , in line with the characteristic architecture of the university. Several colleges have other period architecture, such as Georgian and Federal , and the two most recent ( Morse and Ezra Stiles ) have modernist concrete exteriors. \n Students are assigned to a residential college in their freshman year. Only two residential colleges ( Silliman and Timothy Dwight ) house freshmen. The majority of on-campus freshmen live on the " Old Campus ", an extensive quadrangle formed by older buildings. Each residential college has its own dining hall, but students are permitted to eat in any residential college dining hall or the large dining facility called "Commons". \n Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Berkeley College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Branford College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Calhoun College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Davenport College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Jonathan Edwards College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Trumbull College \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] List of residential colleges \n This is a list of residential colleges at Yale. [ 113 ] \n \n Berkeley College , named for the Rt. Rev. George Berkeley (1685\xe2\x80\x931753), early benefactor of Yale. [ 114 ] \n Branford College , named for Branford, Connecticut , where Yale was briefly located. [ 115 ] \n Calhoun College , named for John C. Calhoun , vice-president and influential member of Congress of the United States. [ 116 ] \n Davenport College , named for Rev. John Davenport , the founder of New Haven. Often called "D\'port". [ 117 ] \n Ezra Stiles College , named for the Rev. Ezra Stiles , a president of Yale. Generally called "Stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. Its buildings were designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 118 ] \n Jonathan Edwards College , named for theologian, Yale alumnus, and Princeton co-founder Jonathan Edwards . Generally called "J.E." The oldest of the residential colleges, J.E. is the only college with an independent endowment, the Jonathan Edwards Trust. [ 119 ] \n Morse College , named for Samuel F. B. Morse , inventor of Morse code and the telegraph . Also designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 120 ] \n Pierson College , named for Yale\'s first rector, Abraham Pierson . [ 121 ] A statue of Abraham Pierson stands on Yale\'s Old Campus. [ 122 ] \n Saybrook College , named for Old Saybrook, Connecticut , the town in which Yale was founded. [ 123 ] \n Silliman College , named for noted scientist and Yale professor Benjamin Silliman . About half of its structures were originally part of the Sheffield Scientific School . [ 124 ] \n Timothy Dwight College , named for the two Yale presidents of that name, Timothy Dwight IV and Timothy Dwight V . Often abbreviated "T.D." [ 125 ] \n Trumbull College , named for Jonathan Trumbull , first Governor of Connecticut. [ 126 ] \n \n \nIn 1998, Yale launched a series of extensive renovations to the older residential buildings, which in many decades of existence had seen only routine maintenance and incremental improvements to plumbing, heating, and electrical and network wiring. Many of these renovations have now been completed, and among other improvements, renovated colleges feature newly built basement facilities including snack bars called "butteries," game rooms, theaters, athletic facilities, fine arts studios, and music practice rooms. \n In June 2008, President Levin announced that the Yale Corporation had authorized the construction of two new residential colleges, scheduled to open in 2013. The additional colleges, to be built in the northern part of the campus, will allow for expanded admission and a reduction of crowding in the existing residential colleges. [ 127 ] Designs have been released, and some public controversy has surfaced over Yale\'s decision to demolish a number of historic buildings on the site, including a recently constructed library, in order to clear it for the $600&#160;million new structures. [ 128 ] \n [ edit ] Student organizations \n Main article: List of Yale University student organizations \n The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The latter categories include the Yale Daily News , which was first published in 1878, the weekly Yale Herald , published since 1986, and The Yale Record , which was established in 1872 and is America\'s oldest college humor magazine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition [ 129 ] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio [ 130 ] is the campus\'s radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM &amp; FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. \n The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki . The Yale International Relations Association functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. \n The campus also includes several fraternities and sororities . The campus features at least 18 a&#160;cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs , who are unusual among college singing groups in being made up solely of senior men. \n Yale\'s secret societies include Skull and Bones , Scroll and Key , Wolf\'s Head , Book and Snake , Elihu , Berzelius , St.&#160;Elmo , Manuscript , and Mace and Chain . The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916). [ 131 ] \n The Elizabethan Club , a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the "Lizzie\'s" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, a first edition of Milton\'s Paradise Lost , among other important literary texts. \n [ edit ] Traditions \n Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their " bright college years ". [ 132 ] ("Bright College Years," the University\'s alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand , Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein .) Yale\'s student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus. Actual students rarely do so. [ 133 ] In the second half of the twentieth century Bladderball , a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009 and 2011, but its future remains uncertain. [ 134 ] \n [ edit ] Athletics \n \n \n \n  \nThe Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex. \n \n \n Main article: Yale Bulldogs \n Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference , the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association . Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division&#160;I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. \n Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation\'s first natural "bowl" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl ), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium , the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world. [ 135 ] October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale\'s fourth new boathouse in 157&#160;years of collegiate rowing. The Richard Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder&#160;\'79 and her father Richard Gilder&#160;\'54, who gave $4&#160;million towards the $7.5&#160;million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men\'s team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race . \n Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men\'s eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club , founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. \n In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school\'s ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game. [ 136 ] \n For kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played bladderball . [ 137 ] \n Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee , by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] \n [ edit ] Song \n Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement , convocation , alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, " Bright College Years ", and the Yale fight song , "Down the Field." \n Two other fight songs, "Bulldog, Bulldog" and "Bingo Eli Yale", written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days, are still sung at football games. Another fight song sung at games is " Boola Boola ". According to \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1998, \xe2\x80\x9cDown the Field\xe2\x80\x9d ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time. [ 140 ] \n [ edit ] Mascot \n The school mascot is " Handsome Dan ", the known Yale bulldog , and the Yale fight song (written by Cole Porter while he was a student at Yale) contains the refrain , "Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow." The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue . [ 141 ] Yale\'s Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889. [ 142 ] \n Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band . "Precision" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching. [ 143 ] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. \n Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. \n [ edit ] Notable people \n [ edit ] Benefactors \n Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale ; Jeremiah Dummer ; the Harkness family ( Edward , Anna , and William ); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling ; Payne Whitney ; Joseph E. Sheffield , Paul Mellon , Charles B.&#160;G. Murphy and William K. Lanman . The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder , donated $70&#160;million in commemoration of their 50th&#160;reunion. [ 144 ] \n [ edit ] Notable alumni and faculty \n Further information: List of Yale University people &#160;and&#160; List of Yale Law School alumni \n \n \n \n  \nAcademy Award Winning Actress Meryl Streep , Yale School of Drama class of 1975 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPresident William Howard Taft graduated from Yale in 1878. \n \n \n Yale has produced alumni distinguished in their respective fields.

For example, Owen Johnson \'s novel, Stover at Yale , follows the college career of Dink Stover [ 146 ] and Frank Merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs. [ 147 ]  [ 148 ] Yale University was also mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald \'s novel " The Great Gatsby ". Nick Carraway and Tom Buchanan have both graduated from New Haven. The narrator (the former) has written a series of editorials for the Yale News and the following has been "one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven". \n [ edit ] Notes and references \n \n \n ^  As of June 30, 2012.

Harkness Hall on Thursday afternoon, Norton\xe2\x80\x99s talk was the first in the new Yale Distinguished Speaker Series on Happiness. The talk was co-sponsored by two undergraduate organizations \xe2\x80\x94 InspireYale and Yale Flourish \xe2\x80\x94 both of which aim to promote and explore the academic study of human happiness. Norton, whose extensive research on the role of money in happiness has brought him prominence in the scientific community, is the first of four speakers that will visit Yale in the next month. \n \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think money can\xe2\x80\x99t buy happiness,\xe2\x80\x9d Norton said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re not spending it right.\xe2\x80\x9d \n People normally spend their money on themselves, Norton said, but the professor\xe2\x80\x99s research has shown they would be happier if they spent more of it on others. He and his team tested this theory on students at the University of British Columbia. After asking students how happy they felt, the researchers gave money to two different groups \xe2\x80\x94 one that was told to spend it on themselves and another that was told to spend it on somebody else. When researchers contacted both groups later that day, those who spent their money on other people reported feeling much happier than those who did not. \n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s less about the amount, and more about what you do with the money,\xe2\x80\x9d Norton explained. \n His team replicated the experiment in Uganda. Even though subjects purchased different products, Norton found the results were the same. \n \xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out that giving to other people \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a silly scarf or life-saving medications \xe2\x80\x94 is roughly the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \n Norton has also used his findings to help organizations explore how money might be used to improve happiness among their members. In one of his studies, team productivity and relationships improved when subjects on sales teams were given money to spend on their teammates. \n In his talk, Norton also said he thinks current corporate philanthropy practices should be restructured. According to his research, employee happiness and morale improve if employees are allowed to participate in their company\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropic giving and donate to the causes they care about. \n Toward the end of the talk, Norton assured his audience that though they are now aware of this phenomenon, they can still experience the psychological benefits of spending money on others. More than anything, Norton said he hopes to \xe2\x80\x9cliberate people to be nice\xe2\x80\x9d by making being nice less awkward. \n \xe2\x80\x9cWhen people do nice things for you, you often think, \xe2\x80\x98What do they want?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Norton said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing we have left to be nice to people is to forward them links to YouTube and The New Yorker.\xe2\x80\x9d \n This point resonated with Socheata Poeuv SOM \xe2\x80\x9912, who said Norton\xe2\x80\x99s idea would give people more confidence to help others without being perceived as strange. \n Laurel Cohen \xe2\x80\x9916 said her experiences as a community service organizer made more sense in light of Norton\xe2\x80\x99s findings. \n \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so interesting the ways you can trick people into going to something that they\xe2\x80\x99ll feel good about doing later,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \n Norton\xe2\x80\x99s new book \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending,\xe2\x80\x9d which explores his findings in greater depth, will be released on May 14. \n\t\t\t \n   Comments \n \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n   \n \t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n \t\n\t Recommended  A tale of two engineering schools  Sloan: The Game, Google edition  Elena Kagan to leave Harvard Law  At Harvard Law, new competition for Yale  In \xe2\x80\x9908 donations, Yale trails Harvard   \n\t\t\n\t\n \n\t\t\t Advertisement \t\t\t   \n\t\t \t\t\t \r\n \n\t\t \t\t  \t \n\t \n  \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Contact Us | Advertise | Archives | Subscribe | Login \n\t\t \n  &copy; 2013 Yale Daily News &bull; All Rights Reserved'

Harvard Medical School announced last week that economic pressures led it to \n shut down its half-century old primate research facility in Southborough . \n \n \n &ldquo;This is really, really meaningful in this context, as we&rsquo;ve all confronted or are challenged by the sequester,&rdquo; said Isaac T. Kohlberg, chief technology development officer at Harvard. &ldquo;This is very, very powerful fuel for the research engine of the university.&rdquo; \n \n \n The gift will be used to support grants to researchers from across Harvard. The money will also launch a fellowship at Harvard Business School to support life science entrepreneurship among the students there, increasing their exposure to technologies and basic research. Blavatnik attended Harvard Business School and founded Access Industries, an international company with investments in natural resources, media and telecommunications, and real estate. \n \n \n &ldquo;By increasing the collaborative efforts between Harvard Business School and Harvard&rsquo;s scientific community, we will empower the next generation of life science entrepreneurs and provide a further catalyst for innovation and research development,&rdquo; Blavatnik said in a statement. He was not available for an interview. \n \n \n In 2005, Harvard shifted the focus of its Office of Technology Development to development and entrepreneurship. Since then, its biomedical accelerator fund has supported 37 projects; about half of those are being developed further, through partnerships with companies. \n \n \n Greg Verdine, a Harvard chemistry professor, said that accelerator funding helped bring a project in his laboratory to the point where several pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest. \n \n \n Verdine has been developing a new class of drugs intended to address a major problem for drug developers: Traditional drug molecules are incapable of binding a vast number of attractive targets. The work has led to early versions of two experimental drugs &mdash; one that targets proteins linked to tumor development and another that could be a diabetes treatment. \n \n \n Vicki Sato, a Harvard Business School professor who has also worked at major biotechnology companies, said the initiative truly fills a need. \n \n \n Sato said research findings that come out of academic laboratories are often less robust than the ones companies need to develop biomedical insight toward a product. \n \n \n \n The funds given out through the accelerator program, she said, will allow researchers to take some of the extra steps to advance research to the point where an industry partner or biotech start-up could move it toward a possible therapy. \n \n \n &ldquo;Harvard has been criticized, in the past, compared to our neighbors down to the river of being more of a knowledge for knowledge&rsquo;s sake university,&rdquo; Sato said. \n \r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t \n\t \n \n \n\t \n \n\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\t \r\n\t\r\n \r\n \n\t \n \r\n \r\n\t E-mail \r\n \r\n \r\n\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t E-mail this article \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t To: \r\n\t\t\t Invalid E-mail address \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t Add a personal message: (80 character limit) \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t Your E-mail: \r\n\t\t\t Invalid E-mail address \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\t Sending your article \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t Your article has been sent. \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t \r\n\t \r\n \n \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\t\t\t Previous Post Science In Mind \r\n\t\t\t\t\t Next Post \r\n\t\t\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n \r\n\t\t\t \n\t \n\t\t\n\t \n \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t \n\t \n\n\t\t \n\t \n \n\n \n\n\t \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n\n\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t LOG IN TO COMMENT \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSorry, we\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcould not find your e-mail or password.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease try again, or click\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t here \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tretrieve your password.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Existing users \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t * \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tE-mail:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t * \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPassword:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t * \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScreen name:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t (*\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfields are required) \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Login \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Forgot your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tpassword? \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t New users \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease take a minute to register.

First you find out where it\xe2\x80\x99s unsafe. \n Answers to that and other key questions would provide the foundation for effective policy, a team of four Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) students told Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley on Wednesday. \n The four \xe2\x80\x94 Aaron Pervin, Temitope Olukowi, Claire Albert, and Marie McIntee \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xa0were the winners of an annual spring exercise at HSPH in which student teams examine a health policy issue and devise recommendations on how to address it. \n In their presentation, the students told Pressley that dealing with Boston\xe2\x80\x99s bike-safety problem \xe2\x80\x94 made apparent by a string of fatal accidents last year \xe2\x80\x94 is especially difficult because information on ridership, common routes, and even accidents is scattered among reports by the Boston Police Departme nt, ambulance teams, emergency rooms, and a variety of city departments. \n The team proposed coupling a movable four-camera system with advanced software to gather information for analysis by a private company or a city staffer. The cameras, used for research only, could be posted at an intersection for a short period of time and then moved to another part of the city. \n The cameras would reveal not only whether cyclists use a particular street or intersection, but also the volume of bike traffic, accident severity, and details on riders\xe2\x80\x99 age and sex. \xc2\xa0That information would go into a centralized database, along with bicycle-related reports from Boston police and other city agencies. Officials would better understand how bicyclists use city streets and be able to determine where bike lanes or other interventions are needed. \n  At Boston City Hall, HSPH student Temitope Olukowi demonstrated the city&#8217;s bike-safety problem to members of the Boston City Council. \n \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a fundamental shift in how we collect data, use data, and share data,\xe2\x80\x9d McIntee said. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout good data, no good decisions are made.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Boston has made a major push in recent years to become more bicycle-friendly. In April 2011, Mayor Thomas M. Menino signed an agreement with Alta Bicycle Share, creating the Hubway bicycle-sharing program, which lets residents and visitors buy passes to use bicycles from stations located across the city. Last year it logged more than half a million trips. \n \xe2\x80\x9cAn increase in bicycle ridership brings an increased need for measures to ensure the safety of cyclists,\xe2\x80\x9d Pressley said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want Boston to be the safest bicycling city.\xe2\x80\x9d \n City Councilor Felix Arroyo , who attended the first part of the presentation, backed that goal. \n \xe2\x80\x9cAs a city, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten exponentially better than just a few years ago, but there is much more we can do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Arroyo, who last month announced a run to succeed Menino as mayor. \n Capt. Jack Danilecki of the Boston police, former commander of the tactical bicycle unit, said that five cyclists were killed in Boston last year. Police are taking an initial step to address the problem by issuing reminders \xe2\x80\x94 in the form of $20 tickets \xe2\x80\x94 to cyclists who run red lights and stop signs that they are legally bound to obey the rules of the road. \n The deaths \xe2\x80\x9care unacceptable, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to figure out how to make bicycling safer in the city,\xe2\x80\x9d said Danilecki, who visited HSPH to brief students during the spring exercise. \n The students\xe2\x80\x99 data-centered approach reflects the city\xe2\x80\x99s own recognition of the need to understand a problem before designing solutions. Boston police have collaborated with HSPH on a report on bicycle safety that is nearing completion, Danilecki said. \n This was the second year for HSPH\xe2\x80\x99s spring exercise. Modeled on a similar program at the Harvard Kennedy School, it was launched last year under the leadership of John McDonough , director of the Center for Public Health Leadership and a professor of the practice of public health. Fawn Phelps, the center\xe2\x80\x99s assistant director, described the contest for Pressley during Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s event, saying that the 50 students who participated listened to talks by nearly 40 experts on the issue before setting to work on policy recommendations. \n A recurring theme among the experts was the inadequacy of data, Olukowi said. While a bicycle lane on Commonwealth Avenue may seem to make sense, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to know without data. Perhaps bicycle lanes in retail areas would drive business to those stores, as some claim, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no hard evidence to support that. Olukowi likened the situation to a physician writing a prescription for high blood pressure medicine without making sure that hypertension is the patient\xe2\x80\x99s problem. \n Pervin highlighted a map of bicycle accident hotspots developed by San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 \n a standard-setter on bicycle safety. The map had different colored dots showing not just accident sites, but also whether the cyclist, automobile, or pedestrian was at fault. \n  \xe2\x80\x9cMassachusetts is leading the way with health reform and, with the proper injury surveillance database, Boston could be a leader in bicycle safety,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron Pervin, showing a map of bicycle accident hotspots developed by San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 a standard-setter on bicycle safety. \n But San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s map lacks volume data, Pervin said, which could provide a better sense of how dangerous an area is. For example, six accidents at an intersection used by 1,000 cyclists is likely more dangerous than one used by 5,000 cyclists. Volume data, enabled by the advanced cameras, would allow Boston to leapfrog San Francisco with respect to safety, Pervin said. \n \xe2\x80\x9cMassachusetts is leading the way with health reform and, with the proper injury surveillance database, Boston could be a leader in bicycle safety,\xe2\x80\x9d Pervin said. \n Questioned by Pressley, Albert said the cameras cost about $3,000 each and there would be additional cost to analyze video. A private service would cost $15 to $20 an hour, but the students recommended the city hire a single person to do the review. \n Pressley, who described herself as \xe2\x80\x9cpassionate\xe2\x80\x9d about the issue because of its health ramifications, called the students\xe2\x80\x99 proposal \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthoughtful,\xe2\x80\x9d and said it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe beginning of a longer conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Anne Lusk , a research scientist in HSPH\xe2\x80\x99s Nutrition Department whose work focuses on bicycling and its health benefits, said the recommendations are a move to make cycling part of the city\xe2\x80\x99s fabric, with not only bicycle lanes for people who commute to work, but also extra-wide lanes to enable side-by-side social riding and more convenient storage at apartments and stores.

The Summer Funding\ndivision of OCS (at 54 Dunster Street) offers an assortment of\nfunding sources for international activities, most notably the\nWeissman Fellowship. For the broad spectrum of funding across\nall domains (study, interational, public service, research, etc.),\nbe sure to peruse the Harvard College Funding\nSources Database . \n\n\n \n PRISE , \nBLISS , and \nPRIMO . These Harvard College programs focus on\nthe development of a residential community among researchers for\napproximately 150 Harvard continuing undergraduate sstudents\nconducting full-time science, social science, and business research\nwith faculty in Cambridge and Boston during the summer. \nLodging and meals are provided as components of thsee programs, but\nmodest research support and summer savings coverage for financial\naid students also is provided to those participants who qualify, in\nexchange for active participation in the residential community. \n\n\n \n \n ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS . Thesis research\nfunding and other modest funding to conduct research with\ndisciplinary faculty is available through some academic\ndepartments. Be sure also to check with HCRP as a source of funds for thesis\nresearch. \n\n\n \n \nOTHER CENTERS AND RESEARCH ENTERPRISES . Depending\non your interest, and the type of project you want to work on with\nfaculty, make sure you check on funding that me be available within\ncenters and research units. \n\n\n \n FACULTY . If indeed the work you do\nsupports the data collection or analysis of data by faculty, they\ncould have some external (grant) funding that may be used to\nprovide you with a small stipend. Make sure you include a\nconversation with your faculty mentor as you deliberate the range\nof sources available to you. They may come up with sources\nthat you may not have thought of. If eligible for thesis\nsupport, it may be worthwhile to seek support through the Dean\'s Research Award administered by the Student\nEmployment Office . \n\n\n \n OUTSIDE FUNDING . While there are many\nsources of support within the university, you still may want to\nconsider what may be available from outside sources. The Community of Science Funding\nDatabase is among the most comprehensive listings of outside\nsource funding, and can be sorted across a broad range of\nparameters to narrow the focus of your search. Be aware,\nhowever, that funding from outside sources tend to take a fair\namount of time from the application to actual award--in some cases\nas much as twelve months. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t \n \n\r\n  \t \r\n  \r\n \t \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\n\n \n\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t Harvard University | Faculty of Arts and Sciences | Harvard College | Copyright &copy;\n\t\t\t\t 2013 President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College'

The Game is played in November at the end of the football season, with the venue alternating between Harvard Stadium and the Yale Bowl .

Harvard won 4\xe2\x80\x930 by scoring four touchdowns and four field goals (at the time, a touchdown merely gave the scoring team the opportunity to gain one point by converting the field goal). At the time, the sport of American football was still evolving from rugby . \n The rules that governed the early years of The Game were a modified version of the rules of rugby and made the game particularly brutal. In the second half of The Game of 1892, Harvard introduced the flying wedge formation, devised by chess master Lorin F. Deland, which so devastated Yale players that it was outlawed the following season (nevertheless, Yale won 6\xe2\x80\x930). Between 1890 and 1894, The Game was played on neutral territory in Hampden Park, Springfield, MA (roughly halfway between Cambridge and New Haven). After The Game of 1894, which came to be known as the "Hampden Park Bloodbath" and about which newspapers reported seven players carried off the field "in dying condition," the two schools broke off all official contact including athletic competition for two years. Since resuming in 1897 at Harvard, The Game has been played annually, except during World War I and World War II , alternating between Cambridge and New Haven. \n The first known reference to "The Game" occurs in an 1898 letter by former Harvard captain A. Holden (class of 1888) to Harvard coach Cam Forbes on the occasion of The Game being permanently moved to the end of the season (" it also makes the Yale\xe2\x80\x93Harvard game the last game of the season "). But public capitalized reference to The Game appears to have been first made by syndicated sports columnist Red Smith . In 1959, he called a Yale athletics official at the time, Charlie Loftus, to say he wouldn\'t be able to make that year\'s Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football match. Loftus disbelievingly replied, "What? You\'re going to miss \'The Game.\'" Although Smith\'s absence went largely unnoticed at the game that year, his column did not. In that week\'s paper, Smith "borrowed" the sobriquet from Loftus\' comment and christened the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry football match "The Game" for good. The name clinched its legendary foothold when, the following year, Harvard Sports Information Director Baron Pittenger mantled the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale game program with the respective title, and that made the name stick. [ 1 ] \n Since Tim Murphy\'s arrival as Head Coach of Harvard for the 1994 season, Harvard has dominated the series, going 14\xe2\x80\x935, including 11 of the last 12 through 2012. This makes Murphy the winningest coach in the long series. Yale\'s sole win during the past decade was in 2006. Murphy can also boast of two undefeated and untied teams during this streak, while Yale\'s last unbeaten/untied season was in 1931. Harvard\'s current six-game streak is tied (with Yale\'s 1902\xe2\x80\x9307 six-game streak) for the second longest winning streak of the series behind Yale\'s 1880\xe2\x80\x931889 eight-game streak. \n Harvard has been the better "spoiler" between the two teams. Over the past century, of the ten times Yale entered The Game undefeated, it exited the game victorious only once, while Harvard "upset" the Bulldogs on seven occasions: 1912, 1921, 1937, 1968 (with the infamous 29\xe2\x80\x9329 "tie"), 1974, 1979 and 2007. Over the same period of time, Harvard has arrived at The Game undefeated nine times, triumphing all but once (1931). \n The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry is the second oldest continuing rivalry and also the third most-played rivalry game in college football history, after the Lehigh \xe2\x80\x93 Lafayette Rivalry (1884) and the Princeton \xe2\x80\x93Yale game (1873). As of 2012, the Harvard Crimson and Yale Bulldogs have met 129 times since the first game in 1875. \n [ edit ] Significance \n For many students and alumni of Harvard and Yale, The Game is an important event. The schools are located only a few hours\' travel from one another; and, perhaps because they are among the nation\'s most prestigious and oldest universities, the rivalry is intense. Beating the rival is often considered more important than the team\'s season record. Since 1900, the Game has been the final game of the season for both teams, since Ivy League schools do not participate in post-season football games (the one exception occurring in 1919, when Harvard beat Yale 3\xe2\x80\x930 and then went on to the 1920 Rose Bowl Game , in which they defeated Oregon 7\xe2\x80\x936). \n \n \n \n  \nHalf-time festivities at The Game, Yale Bowl . \n \n \n The Game is significant for historical reasons in that the first game of the rivalry (in November 1875) was the second American football game played between U.S. colleges featuring a ball-carrying form of the game (the first being a Harvard-Tufts football match that occurred in June 1875). The rules of that game soon were adopted by other schools, such as Rutgers and Princeton, which had been playing soccer (i.e., Association Football ) since 1869, and American football quickly became the archetypal college sport. The schools that would become the Ivy League played the leading role in the development of American football in the late 19th century; football\'s rules, conventions, and equipment, as well as elements of "atmosphere" such as the mascot and fight song , include many elements pioneered or nurtured at Harvard and Yale. For many years, The Game was also likely to determine the Ivy League championship. The Game receives less national attention today; most college football fans are more interested in games between larger institutions whose teams are made up of scholarship athletes, many of them bound for professional careers. The high attendance at Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl for the contest testify that The Game still generates interest beyond the respective campuses and alumni bodies; tickets for The Game generally sell out even in modern times when The Game is played at Harvard, as Harvard Stadium\'s seating capacity is less than half that of the Yale Bowl. \n In 2003, Sports Illustrated magazine ("On Campus" edition) rated the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry as the sixth-best in college athletics. \n [ edit ] Notable games \n [ edit ] First tie: 1879 \n The game played on November 8, 1879 ended in a scoreless tie , the first of eight ties in the series. \n [ edit ] Harvard Beats Yale, 29\xe2\x80\x9329 \n \n See 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game \n \n In 1968, the Harvard team made a miraculous last-moment comeback by scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie a highly touted Yale squad. Yale had a 16-game winning streak and both teams were undefeated for the season at 8\xe2\x80\x930 coming into the game. \n The tie left both teams 8\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 for the season, inspiring The Harvard Crimson to print the headline " Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29 ". [ 2 ] This headline was later used as the title for a 2008 documentary about this Game directed by Kevin Rafferty . [ 3 ] \n This game stands as the final tie in the series, as subsequent rule changes have eliminated ties from college football. [ 4 ] \n [ edit ] First overtime game: 2005 \n On November 19, 2005, Harvard defeated Yale in the rivalry\'s first overtime matchup. Harvard won by a score of 30\xe2\x80\x9324 after three overtime periods. \n [ edit ] Pranks \n The Game is an inviting target for pranksters. For example, in 1961 in New Haven, The Harvard Crimson student newspaper distributed a parody of The Yale Daily News with a headline saying that President Kennedy would attend. At the Bowl, the President of the Crimson ( Robert Ellis Smith ) donned a mask of President Kennedy, had friends dressed as a Secret Service man and a military aide, and walked on the field before the game as the Harvard Band played " Hail to the Chief ". Thousands of early arrivals and sports writers were fooled by the prank. President Kennedy, a Harvard graduate, was listening to the game on the radio in Hyannisport, according to later news reports. \n Prior to The Game in 1933, Handsome Dan II, Yale\'s bulldog mascot, was kidnapped (allegedly by members of the Harvard Lampoon ). Then, the morning after a 19\xe2\x80\x936 upset by Harvard over Yale, after hamburger was smeared on the feet of the statue of John Harvard that sits in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard \xe2\x80\x93 a photo was snapped of Handsome Dan licking John Harvard\'s feet. The photo ran on the front page of papers throughout the country. [ 5 ] \n In 1962, Harvard Band members marched through New Haven, playing their instruments at 3 a.m. much to the chagrin of the New Haven police. \n MIT "Hacks" [ 6 ] \nPerhaps the most famous exploit was carried out at Harvard Stadium during the second quarter in 1982, when a Harvard score was immediately followed by a huge black weather balloon , previously installed under the 45 yard line by students from MIT as the letters painted on its side proclaimed, slowly inflating until it exploded, spraying talcum powder over the field (Harvard won, 45\xe2\x80\x937). \n For the 2006 Game, MIT students secretly replaced the "VE-RI-TAS" insignia on the Harvard Stadium Scoreboard with an insignia that read "HU-GE-EGO". \n On November 18, 1990, during the third quarter of The Game, MIT students carried out a less surreptitious assault. As a kicker prepared for a field goal, a rocket shot from the field over the goal posts, hanging an MIT banner. The rocket was launched using 480 feet of wire that ran underneath the field. A headline the next day in the Boston Herald read, "MIT 1 \xe2\x80\x94 Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale 0; Tech Pranksters Steal the Show" (although Yale won the actual football game, 34\xe2\x80\x9319). \n In 2006, two streakers with MIT painted on their bodies attempted to run around the field during the game. One made it the length of the field before being caught and dragged off the field; the other was tackled by security about ten steps out of the stands. \n \nDuring the pregame show in 1992, the Harvard marching band attempted to "X-out" [ clarification needed ] the Yale Precision Marching Band while the Yale band stood in its traditional Y formation; however, the Yale band caught wind of this plan and, as the Harvard band marched onto the field, shifted its formation into a large H, thus making Harvard X itself out. [ citation needed ] \n In 2004, Yale students handed out placards to some 1,800 adult Harvard fans; when raised, the signs spelled out " WE SUCK ". Harvard won that game 35\xe2\x80\x933. \n In 2012, the Game was hosted at Harvard University. During tailgate the Yale prank group the Pundits had an anti-Harvard banner skywritten via plane. \n [ edit ] Tailgate \n The Game has also become known for the large, joint Harvard-Yale tailgate parties that run throughout The Game in the fields next to the host stadium every year. The tailgate party was even televised by ESPN in 2004. While most alumni who travel to The Game actually watch it in the stadium, most students and recent alumni treat the tailgate as their primary destination. The tailgate attracts thousands of students and has recently roused the concern of the Boston Police Department , who have cracked down on underage drinking at the student tailgates, as well as moving it further away from the stadium and reducing the space available. [ 7 ] This included requiring, in 2008, that all tailgates end at halftime, leading Yale students to shift most of their tailgating to the Princeton game, held the previous week in New Haven. \n In 2011, a tailgater was killed from a U-Haul truck collision. [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Bulldog legend \n Apocryphal tales assert that before the 1908 Game, Harvard coach Percy Haughton strangled a bulldog to death in the locker room to motivate his players. Research has indicated that there were no contemporary reports of this incident \xe2\x80\x93 and later accounts suggest that Haughton had created a Bulldog doll and had strangled that. In addition, these reports indicate that he had attached the doll to his car and drove around town dragging the doll. Whatever the facts are, Harvard did win the 1908 game, 4\xe2\x80\x930, the culmination of a 9\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 national championship season.

It was named for John Harvard , its first benefactor. It received its corporate charter in 1650 and became a university in 1780. [ citation needed ] \n An early, anonymous description of the college, New England\'s First Fruits (1643) recalled: \n \n "After God had carried us safe to New England, and we ... rear\'d convenient places for God\'s worship ... dreading to leave an illiterate Ministry to the Churches, when our present Ministers shall lie in the Dust ... it pleased God to stir up the heart of one Mr. Harvard, a godly gentleman and a lover of learning ... to give the one half of his estate ... towards the erecting of a college and all his Library." [ 1 ] \n \n When the college\'s first president Henry Dunster abandoned Puritanism in favor of the Baptist faith in 1654, he provoked a controversy that highlighted two distinct approaches to dealing with dissent in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . The colony\'s Puritan leaders, whose own religion was born of dissent from mainstream Church of England, generally worked for reconciliation with members who questioned matters of Puritan theology but responded much more harshly to outright rejection of Puritanism. Dunster\'s conflict with the colony\'s magistrates began when he failed to have his infant son baptized, believing, as a newly converted Baptist, that only adults should be baptized. Efforts to restore Dunster to Puritan orthodoxy failed, and his apostasy proved untenable to colony leaders who had entrusted him, in his job as Harvard\'s president, to uphold the colony\'s religious mission. Thus, he represented a threat to the stability of society. Dunster exiled himself in 1654 and moved to nearby Plymouth Colony , where he died in 1658. [ 2 ] \n In 1692, the leading Puritan divine Increase Mather became president of Harvard. One of his acts was replacing pagan classics with books by Christian authors in ethics classes, and maintaining a high standard of discipline. The Harvard "Lawes" of 1642 and the "Harvard College Laws of 1700" testify to its original high level of discipline. [ 3 ] Students were required to observe rules of pious decorum inconceivable in the 19th century, and ultimately to prove their fitness for the bachelor\'s degree by showing that they could \'read the original of the Old and New Testament into the Latin tongue, and resolve them logically.\' [ 4 ] \n During Harvard\'s early years the town of Cambridge maintained order on campus and provided economic support; the local Puritan minister had direct oversight of Harvard and ensured the orthodoxy of the its leadership. By 1700 Harvard was strong enough to regulate and discipline its own people, and to a large extent the direction in which support and assistance was reversed, Harvard now providing financial support for local economic expansion, improvements to public health, and construction of local roads, meetinghouses , schools. [ 5 ] \n The early motto of Harvard was Veritas Christo et Ecclesiae , meaning "Truth for Christ and the Church." In the early classes half the graduates became ministers. By the 1760s the proportion was down to 15%. Ten out of the first twelve presidents were also ministers. Systematic theological instruction was inaugurated in 1721 and by 1827 Harvard became a nucleus of theological teaching in New England. [ 6 ] \n When Mather stepped down as president in 1701 it marked the beginning of a long term struggle between orthodoxy and liberalism. Harvard\'s first secular president was John Leverett, who began his term in 1708. Leverett left the curriculum largely intact and sought to keep the College independent of the overwhelming influence of any single sect. [ 7 ] \n During the American Revolution, Loyalist alumni were outnumbered seven to one by Patriots\xe2\x80\x94seven alumni died in the fighting. [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] 19th century \n [ edit ] Unitarians \n The takeover of Harvard by the Unitarians in 1805 resulted in the secularization of the American college. By 1850 Harvard was the "Unitarian Vatican." The "liberals" (Unitarians) allied themselves with high Federalists and began to create a set of private societies and institutions meant to shore up their cultural and political authority, a movement that prefigured the emergence of the Boston Brahmin class. On the other hand, the theological conservatives used print media to argue for the maintenance of open debate and democratic governance through a diverse public sphere, seeing the liberals\' movement as an attempt to create a cultural oligarchy in opposition to Congregationalist tradition and republican political principles. [ 9 ] \n [ edit ] Science \n In 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on his campus at Harvard College. Agassiz\'s approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans\' \'participation in the Divine Nature\' and the possibility of understanding \'intellectual existences.\' Agassiz\'s perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that one can grasp the \'divine plan\' in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart , whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz\'s efforts to \'soar with Plato\' probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norris, and, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge . The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \'official philosophy\' of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school. [ 10 ] \n [ edit ] \xc3\x89litism \n Between 1830 and 1870 Harvard became "privatized". [ 11 ] While the Federalists controlled state government, Harvard had prospered, but the 1824 defeat of the federalist party in Massachusetts allowed the renascent Democratic-Republicans to block state funding of private universities. By 1870, the politicians and ministers that heretofore had made up the university\'s board of overseers had been replaced by Harvard alumni drawn from Boston\'s upper-class business and professional community and funded by private endowment. \n \n \n \n  \nEliza Susan Quincy\'s drawing of the September 1836 procession of Harvard alumni leaving the First Parish Meeting House and walking to the Pavilion. Eliza Susan Quincy was the daughter of Josiah Quincy , President of Harvard University 1829-45. \n \n \n During this period, Harvard experienced unparalleled growth that securely placed it financially in a league of its own among American colleges. Ronald Story notes that in 1850, Harvard\'s total assets were "five times that of Amherst and Williams combined, and three times that of Yale." [ 12 ] Story also notes that "all the evidence\xe2\x80\xa6 points to the four decades from 1815 to 1855 as the era when parents, in Henry Adams\'s words, began \'sending their children to Harvard College for the sake of its social advantages\'". [ 13 ] Under President Eliot\'s tenure, Harvard earned a reputation for being more liberal and democratic than either Princeton or Yale in regard to bigotry against Jews and other ethnic minorities. [ 14 ] In 1870, one year into Eliot\'s term, Richard Theodore Greener became the first African-American to graduate from Harvard College. Seven years later, Louis Brandeis , the first Jewish justice on the Supreme Court , graduated from Harvard Law School. \n Nevertheless, Harvard became the bastion of a distinctly Protestant \xc3\xa9lite \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called Boston Brahmin class \xe2\x80\x94 and continued to be so well into the 20th century. [ 15 ] \n \n \n \n  \nFive Harvard University Presidents sitting in order of when they served. L-R: Josiah Quincy III , Edward Everett , Jared Sparks , James Walker and Cornelius Conway Felton . \n \n \n [ edit ] Eliot \n Charles W. Eliot , president 1869-1909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person. [ 16 ] \n [ edit ] Sports \n Football, originally organized by students as an extracurricular activity, was banned twice by the university for being a brutal and dangerous sport. However, by the 1880s, football became a dominant force at the college as the alumni became more involved in the sport. In 1882, the faculty formed a three-member athletic committee to oversee all intercollegiate athletics, but, due to increasing student and alumni pressure, the committee was expanded in 1885 to include three student and three alumni members. The alumni\'s role in the rise and commercialization of football, the leading moneymaker for athletics by the 1880s, was evident in the fundraising for the first steel-reinforced concrete stadium. The class of 1879 donated $100,000 - nearly one-third of the cost - to the construction of the 35,000-seat stadium, which was completed in 1903, with the remainder to be collected from future ticket sales. [ 17 ] \n [ edit ] 20th century \n During the 20th century, Harvard\'s international reputation for scholarship grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university\'s scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program. It built the largest and finest academic library in the world, and built up the labs and clinics needed to establish the reputation of its science departments and the Medical School . The Law School vied with Yale Law for preeminence, while the Business School combined a large-scale research program with a special appeal to entrepreneurs rather than accountants. The different schools maintain their separate endowments, which are very large in the case of the College/Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the Business, Law and Medical Schools, but quite modest for the Divinity and Education schools. \n Radcliffe College , established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In the 1920s Edward Harkness , (1874\xe2\x80\x931940), a Yale man with oil wealth, was ignored by his alma mater and so gave $12,000,000 to Harvard to establish a house system like that of Oxford University. Yale later took his money and set up a similar system. \n In addition to the usual department, specialized research centers proliferated, especially to enable interdisciplinary research projects that could not be handled at the department level. The departments, however, kept jealous control of the awarding of tenure; typically tenured professorships went to outsiders, and not as promotions to assistant professors. Older research centers include the East Asian Research Center, the Center for International Affairs, the Center for Eastern Studies, the Russian Research Center, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History, and the Joint Center for Urban Studies (with MIT ). The Centers raised their own money, sometimes from endowments but most often from federal and foundation grants, making them increasingly independent entities. [ 18 ] \n During World War II , Harvard was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. [ 19 ] \n [ edit ] Meritocracy \n James Bryant Conant (president, 1933\xe2\x80\x931953) pledged to reinvigorate creative scholarship at Harvard and reestablish its preeminence among research institutions. Viewing higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, Conant decided that Harvard\'s undergraduate curriculum needed to be revised so as to place more emphasis on general education. He called on the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report , published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century. [ 20 ] \n In the decades immediately after 1945 Harvard reformed its admissions policies as it sought students from a more diverse applicant pool. Whereas Harvard undergraduates had almost exclusively been upper-class alumni of select New England "feeder schools" such as Exeter , Hotchkiss , Choate Rosemary Hall and Milton Academy , increasing numbers of international, minority, and working-class students had, by the late 1960s, altered the ethnic and socio-economic makeup of the college. [ 21 ] \n Not just undergraduates but the faculty became more diverse, especially in its willingness to hire Jews, Catholics and foreign scholars. The History Department was among the first to hire Jews and how it contributed to the university trend toward professionalism from 1920 to 1950. Oscar Handlin became one of the most influential professors, training hundreds of graduate schools and later serving as head of the University Library. [ 22 ] \n During the 20th century, Harvard\'s international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university\'s scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program. Radcliffe College , established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. \n [ edit ] Women \n Nonetheless, Harvard\'s undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe. [ 23 ] Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States. Harvard\'s graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-war period. In 1999, Radcliffe College , founded in 1879 as the "Harvard Annex for Women", [ 24 ] merged formally with Harvard University, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study . \n [ edit ] Minorities \n \n \n \n  \n Harvard Yard as seen from the Holyoke Center \n \n \n Though Harvard ended required chapel in the mid-1880s, the school remained culturally Protestant, and fears of dilution grew as enrollment of immigrants, Catholics and Jews surged at the turn of the 20th century. By 1908, Catholics made up nine percent of the freshman class, and between 1906 and 1922, Jewish enrollment at Harvard increased from six to 25%. President A. Lawrence Lowell tried to impose a 12% quota on Jews; the faculty rejected it but he managed to cut the numbers in half anyway. By the end of World War II the quotas and most of the latent antisemitism had faded away. [ 25 ]  [ 26 ] \n Policies of exclusion were not limited to religious minorities. In 1920, "Harvard University maliciously persecuted and harassed" those it believed to be gay via a " Secret Court " led by President Lowell. Summoned at the behest of a wealthy alumnus, the inquisitions and expulsions carried out by this tribunal, in conjunction with the "vindictive tenacity of the university in ensuring that the stigmatization of the expelled students would persist throughout their productive lives" led to two suicides. Harvard President Lawrence Summers characterized the 1920 episode as "part of a past that we have rightly left behind", and "abhorrent and an affront to the values of our university". [ 27 ] Yet as late as the 1950s, Wilbur Bender, then the dean of admissions for Harvard College, was seeking better ways to "detect homosexual tendencies and serious psychiatric problems" in prospective students. [ 28 ] \n [ edit ] Expansion \n Over the years, Harvard has grown to include a number of major schools. [ 29 ] \n They include: \n \n Arts and Sciences \n Engineering and Applied Sciences \n Harvard Extension School \n Harvard Medical School \n Harvard School of Dental Medicine \n Harvard Business School (Founded in 1908, HBS was originally located in Harvard Yard. The present campus, with its stately Georgian buildings following the gentle curve on the Boston side of the Charles River, was dedicated in June 1927.)

Founded in 1701 in the Colony of Connecticut , the university is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States . \n Originally chartered as the "Collegiate School", the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to establish a college to train clergy and political leaders for the colony. In 1718, the College was renamed "Yale College" to honor a gift from Elihu Yale , a governor of the British East India Company . In 1861, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first U.S. institution to award the PhD. [ 4 ] Yale became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. Yale College was transformed, beginning in the 1930s, through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now exist and two more are planned. Yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and professional students . Almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. [ 5 ]  [ 6 ] \n The University\'s assets include an endowment valued at $19.4&#160;billion as of 2011 [update] , [ 7 ] the second-largest of any academic institution in the world. Yale\'s system of more than two dozen libraries holds 12.5&#160;million volumes. [ 8 ] 49 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the University as students, faculty, and staff. Yale has produced many notable alumni , including five U.S. Presidents , 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices , and several foreign heads of state. At the graduate level, Yale Law School , Yale School of Art , and Yale School of Drama are consistently ranked the top programs in their field. Yale Law School is the most selective law school in the United States. [ 9 ] \n Yale students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League .

Soon thereafter, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers: Samuel Andrew , Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather, James Noyes , James Pierpont , Abraham Pierson , Noadiah Russell , Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge , all of whom were alumni of Harvard , met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford, Connecticut , to pool their books to form the school\'s first library. [ 10 ] The group, led by James Pierpont , is now known as "The Founders". \n Originally called the "Collegiate School", the institution opened in the home of its first rector , Abraham Pierson , [ 11 ] in Killingworth (now Clinton ). The school moved to Saybrook , and then Wethersfield . In 1718 the college moved to New Haven, Connecticut . \n \n \n \n  \nFirst diploma awarded by Yale College , granted to Nathaniel Chauncey, 1702. \n \n \n Meanwhile, a rift was forming at Harvard between its sixth president Increase Mather and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity . The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not. [ 12 ] \n In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony\'s Governor Gurdon Saltonstall , Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman in Wales named Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer , Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in India as a representative of the East India Company , donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum at the time. Yale also donated 417&#160;books and a portrait of King George&#160;I . Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College in gratitude to its benefactor, and to increase the chances that he would give the college another large donation or bequest. Elihu Yale was away in India when the news of the school\'s name change reached his home in Wrexham , Wales, a trip from which he never returned. While he did ultimately leave his fortunes to the "Collegiate School within His Majesties Colony of Connecticot", [ citation needed ] the institution was never able to successfully lay claim to it. \n \n \n \n  \nOld Brick Row in 1807. \n \n \n [ edit ] Curriculum \n Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period\xe2\x80\x94the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment \xe2\x80\x94thanks to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles . They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale, while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment, and fights with the Connecticut legislature . [ 13 ] \n Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language , along with Greek and Latin , and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles , president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase \xd7\x90\xd7\x95\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d \xd7\x95\xd7\xaa\xd7\x9e\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d ( Urim and Thummim ) on the Yale seal. Stiles\' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. Fortunately, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning , Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D. , at 1803, [ 14 ] for his efforts. \n \n \n \n  \n Woolsey Hall in c. 1905 \n \n \n [ edit ] Students \n As the only college in Connecticut, Yale educated the sons of the elite. [ 15 ] Offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During the period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side. [ 16 ] \n The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753, and Brothers in Unity in 1768. [ 17 ] \n [ edit ] 19th century \n \n \n \n  \nMen leaning on the old Yale fence facing Chapel Street, c.&#160;1874. \n \n \n The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. At the same time, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. [ 18 ] At the same time a group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the \'isms\' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. [ 19 ] Perhaps the most well-remembered [ citation needed ] teacher was William Graham Sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909. He taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter , who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education, 1879\xe2\x80\x9381. Porter objected to Sumner\'s use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might intellectually, morally, and religiously harm students. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Sports and debate \n The Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th&#160;century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who regretted he had but one life to lose for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself. [ 21 ] \n Along with Harvard and Princeton , Yale students rejected elite British concepts about \'amateurism\' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football. [ 22 ] The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry began in 1875. \n \n \n \n  \nYale\'s four-oared crew team, posing with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy , won at Philadelphia . \n \n \n Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in the first intercollegiate debate, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart. [ 23 ] \n In 1909\xe2\x80\x9310, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905\xe2\x80\x9306 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries. [ 24 ] \n [ edit ] Expansion \n \n \n \n  \nConnecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753. \n \n \n Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale School of Medicine (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Sheffield Scientific School (1847), [ 25 ] and the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of Timothy Dwight&#160;V , Yale College was renamed Yale University. The university would later add the Yale School of Music (1894), the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1901), the Yale School of Public Health (1915), the Yale School of Nursing (1923), the Yale School of Drama (1955), the Yale Physician Associate Program (1973), and the Yale School of Management (1976). It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School. \n Expansion caused controversy about Yale\'s new roles. Noah Porter , moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter\'s contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. [ 26 ] He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. \n \n \n \n  \nAerial view from the south, 1906. \n \n \n [ edit ] 20th century \n [ edit ] Behavioral sciences \n Between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations , especially ones connected with the Rockefellers , contributed about $7&#160;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology . The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President James R. Angell and psychobiologist Robert M. Yerkes , tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control, sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Biology \n Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison , Grace E. Pickford , and G.&#160;Evelyn Hutchinson , and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison\'s group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford\'s and Hutchinson\'s were not. Pickford\'s group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson\'s example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research. [ 28 ] \n [ edit ] Medicine \n Milton Winternitz led the Yale Medical School as its dean from 1920 to 1935. An innovative, even maverick, leader, he not only kept the school from going under but also turned it into a first-class research institution. [ citation needed ] Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department, and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign. [ 29 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty \n Before World War&#160;II , most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions. [ 30 ] \n [ edit ] History and American Studies \n The American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. Norman Holmes Pearson , who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose. [ 31 ] Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire William R. Coe made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming. Coe was concerned to celebrate the \'values\' of the Western United States in order to meet the "threat of communism." [ 32 ] \n [ edit ] Women \n Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . [ 33 ] \n In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female, declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969. [ 34 ] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate; [ 35 ] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall . \n A decade into co-education, rampant student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale . While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale\'s Grievance Board and the Yale Women\'s Center. [ 36 ] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale. [ 37 ] \n [ edit ] Class \n Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to increase the proportion of white Protestants of notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus ), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970. [ 38 ] \n [ edit ] Town-gown relations \n Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale\'s exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven\'s efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy. [ 39 ] \n [ edit ] Yale in the 21st century \n In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students. [ 40 ] In July 2012, the Peking University-Yale University Program ended due to weak participation. [ 40 ] \n In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale\'s institutional priorities: "First, among the nation\'s finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders." [ 41 ] \n The Boston Globe wrote that "if there\'s one school that can lay claim to educating the nation\'s top national leaders over the past three decades, it\'s Yale." [ 42 ]  Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004. Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush , and major-party nominees during this period include John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Hillary Rodham Clinton (2008), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). \n Several explanations have been offered for Yale\xe2\x80\x99s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. [ 43 ] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\xe2\x80\x99s focus on creating "a laboratory for future leaders," an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster . [ 43 ]  Richard H. Brodhead , former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University , stated: "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [ 42 ] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes "an ethos of organized activity" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union \'s Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News . [ 44 ]  Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: "It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [ 45 ] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the "son and grandson of alumni", and for a "member of a politically influential family." [ 46 ]  New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others. [ 47 ] \n During the 1988 presidential election, George H.&#160;W. Bush (Yale \'48) derided Michael Dukakis for having "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard\'s boutique". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis\'s Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale\'s reputation was "so diffuse, there isn\'t a symbol, I don\'t think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said Yale did not share Harvard\'s reputation for "liberalism and elitism". [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, "In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of \'68 and the class of \'71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation". [ 50 ] \n In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location \xe2\x80\x93 the others are Britain\'s Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara \xe2\x80\x93 for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation \'s United States Faith and Globalization Initiative. [ 51 ] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, "Debating Globalization". [ 52 ] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, "Understanding Politics and Politicians." [ 53 ] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London , and both schools\xe2\x80\x99 affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care\xe2\x80\x94a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but "no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL". [ 54 ] \n Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore set to open in August 2013 as a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore. [ 55 ]  [ 56 ]  [ 57 ] \n [ edit ] Administration and organization \n The President and Fellows of Yale College , also known as the Yale Corporation , is the governing board of the University. \n Yale\'s president Richard C. Levin is one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million. [ 58 ] \n The Yale Provost\'s Office has launched several women into prominent university presidencies. In 1977 Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed acting President of Yale from this position, and went on to become President of the University of Chicago , the first woman to be full president of a major university. In 1994 Yale Provost Judith Rodin became the first female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania . In 2002 Provost Alison Richard became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cambridge . In 2004, Provost Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In 2007 Deputy Provost Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College . In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp , was appointed president of Colgate University and now heads Swarthmore College. \n In 2008 Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford. [ 59 ] Former Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead serves as the President of Duke University . \n [ edit ] Staff and labor unions \n Main article: Federation of Hospital and University Employees \n Much of Yale University\'s staff, including most maintenance staff, dining hall employees, and administrative staff, are unionized . Clerical and technical employees are represented by Local&#160;34 of Unite Here and service and maintenance workers by Local&#160;35 of the same international . Together with the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO), an unrecognized union of graduate employees, Locals&#160;34 and 35 make up the Federation of Hospital and University Employees . Also included in FHUE are the dietary workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital , who are members of 1199 SEIU . [ 60 ] In addition to these unions, officers of the Yale University Police Department are members of the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees. [ 61 ] Finally, Yale security officers voted to join the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in fall 2010 after the National Labor Relations Board ruled they could not join AFSCME ; the Yale administration contested the election. [ 62 ] \n Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes. [ 63 ] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S. [ 64 ] Yale\'s unusually large endowment exacerbates the tension over wages. Moreover, Yale has been accused of failing to treat workers with respect. [ 65 ] In a 2003 strike, however, the university claimed that more union employees were working than striking. [ 66 ] Professor David Graeber was \'retired\' after he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues. [ 67 ] \n [ edit ] Campus \n \n \n \n  \n Yale Law School . \n \n \n Yale\'s central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1&#160;km 2 ). An additional 500 acres (2.0&#160;km 2 ) includes the Yale golf course and nature preserves in rural Connecticut and Horse Island . [ 68 ] \n Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus [ 69 ] as well as for several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn \'s Yale Art Gallery [ 70 ] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen \'s Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph\'s Art &amp; Architecture Building . Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue , which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s. \n Many of Yale\'s buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness [ 71 ] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, [ 72 ] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages , and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower , 216 feet (66&#160;m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon . \n \n \n \n  \n Vanderbilt Hall at the Yale university \n \n \n Other examples of the Gothic (also called neo-Gothic and collegiate Gothic) style are on Old Campus by such architects as Henry Austin , Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis . Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family , including Vanderbilt Hall, [ 73 ] Phelps Hall, [ 74 ]  St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt ), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College , the largest residential college. [ 75 ] \n \n \n \n  \nStatue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall \n \n \n The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style . Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College , Pierson College , and Davenport College , except the latter\'s east, York Street fa\xc3\xa7ade, which was constructed in the Gothic style . \n The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library , designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill , is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. [ 76 ] It is located near the center of the University in Hewitt Quadrangle , which is now more commonly referred to as " Beinecke Plaza ". \n The library\'s six-story above-ground tower of book stacks is surrounded by a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark. \n \n \n \n  \n Interior of Beinecke Library . \n \n \n The sculptures in the sunken courtyard by Isamu Noguchi are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube). \n Alumnus Eero Saarinen , Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St.&#160;Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink at Yale and the newest residential colleges of Ezra Stiles and Morse. These latter were modelled after the medieval Italian hilltown of San Gimignano \xe2\x80\x93 a prototype chosen for the town\'s pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers. These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college\'s many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas. [ 77 ] \n Yale\'s Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale. [ 78 ] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges. [ 79 ] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification. [ 80 ] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls. [ 81 ] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute\xe2\x80\x99s College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \xe2\x80\x9cB+\xe2\x80\x9d grade overall. [ 82 ] \n \n Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven \n Marsh Botanical Garden \n Yale Sustainable Food Project Farm \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n [ edit ] Notable nonresidential campus buildings \n Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel , Beinecke Rare Book Library , Harkness Tower , Ingalls Rink , Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories , Payne Whitney Gymnasium , Peabody Museum of Natural History , Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings , Sterling Memorial Library , Woolsey Hall , Yale Center for British Art , Yale University Art Gallery , and Yale Art &amp; Architecture Building . \n Yale\'s secret society buildings (some of which are called "tombs") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius , Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake , Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu , architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain , in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold ; Manuscript Society , King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key , Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869\xe2\x80\x9370); Skull and Bones , possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo , (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison , 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf\'s Head , Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (erected 1923-4). \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Starr Reading Room \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harkness Tower \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Library Circulation Desk \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Memorial Chapel on Yale\'s Old Campus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Yale School of Management \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale School of Architecture \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale School of Forestry \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Connecticut Hall \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Yale Peabody Museum \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n The Yale Bowl \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Campus safety \n In addition to the Yale University Police Department, founded in 1894, [ 83 ] a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort , and a shuttle service. [ 84 ] \n In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale\'s student and faculty recruiting efforts. [ 85 ] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven\'s crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven police and Yale\'s campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools. [ 86 ] Nonetheless, across the board, the city of New Haven has retained the highest levels of crime of any Ivy League city for more than a decade. [ 87 ] \n Between 2002 and 2004, Yale reported 14 violent crimes ( homicide , aggravated assault , or sex offenses ); in comparison, Harvard reported 83 such incidents, Princeton 24, and Stanford 54. The incidence of nonviolent crime ( burglary , arson , and motor vehicle theft ) was also lower than most of its peer schools. \n In 2004 a national non-profit watchdog group called Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S.&#160;Department of Education , accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults. [ 88 ]  [ 89 ] \n [ edit ] Academics \n [ edit ] Admissions \n \n \n \n  \nYale University\'s Sterling Memorial Library , as seen from Maya Lin\'s sculpture, Women\'s Table . The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. \n \n \n For the Class of 2017, Yale accepted 1,991 students out of a record 29,610 total applications, hitting a record-low acceptance rate of 6.7%. [ 90 ] \n Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2016 was $41,320. Over 10% of students in Yale College are expected to have $0 parental contribution. [ 91 ] \n Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 30% are minorities , and 8% are international students . Fifty-five percent attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools. [ 92 ] In addition, Yale College admits a small group of non-traditional students each year, through the Eli Whitney Students Program . \n [ edit ] Collections \n \n \n \n  \n The Night Caf\xc3\xa9 , Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery . \n \n \n Yale University Library , which holds over 12 million volumes, is the second-largest university collection in the United States. [ 93 ] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library , contains about 4&#160;million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. \n Rare books are found in a number of Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th\xe2\x80\x91century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club , technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. \n Yale\'s museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery is the country\'s first university-affiliated art museum. It contains more than 180,000 works, including old masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn \'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art , the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. \n The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments , affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least well-known of Yale\'s collections, because its hours of opening are restricted. \n The museums also house the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 \xe2\x80\x93 when the removal of such artifacts was legal. Peru would now like to have the items returned; Yale has so far declined. [ 94 ] In November 2010, a Yale University representative agreed to return the artifacts to a Peruvian university.

[ 103 ] It was ranked fourth in the 2011 QS&#160;World University Rankings and tenth in the 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings . [ 104 ]  [ 105 ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University\xe2\x80\x99s Academic Ranking of World Universities , placed Yale at 11 in 2010. ARWU also ranked Yale 25th in Natural Sciences and Mathematics, 76\xe2\x80\x93100th in Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences, 9th in Life and Agriculture Sciences, 21st in Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 8th in Social Sciences worldwide. [ 106 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions \n The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League. [ 107 ] \n Yale\'s English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren , W.K. Wimsatt , and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction . Jacques Derrida , the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called " Yale School ". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J.&#160;Hillis Miller , Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale\'s history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C.&#160;Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery , a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale\'s Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&#160;century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. \n Since summer 2010, Yale has also been host to Yale Publishing Course . \n [ edit ] Campus life \n Yale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates , or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 freshman class, 10% are non\xe2\x80\x91U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools. [ 108 ] Yale is also an open campus for the gay community . [ 109 ]  [ 110 ] Its active LGBT community first received wide publicity in the late 1980s, when Yale obtained a reputation as the "gay Ivy", due largely to a 1987 Wall Street Journal article written by Julie V. Iovine, an alumna and the spouse of a Yale faculty member. During the same year, the University hosted a national conference on gay and lesbian studies and established the Lesbian and Gay Studies Center. [ 111 ] The slogan "One in Four, Maybe More" was coined by the campus gay community. While the community in the 1980s and early 1990s was very activist, today most LGBT events have become part of the general campus social scene. [ 112 ] For example, the annual LGBT Co-op Dance attracts straight as well as gay students. \n [ edit ] Residential colleges \n Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University \n Yale has a system of 12 residential colleges , instituted in 1933 through a grant by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness , who admired the college systems at Oxford and Cambridge. Each college has a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows. Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, a commons room, meeting rooms/classrooms, and a dining hall; in addition some have chapels, libraries, squash courts, pool tables, short order dining counters, cafes, or darkrooms. Each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas, and most of them are open to students from other residential colleges. However, Yale remains a unitary university, while Oxford and Cambridge colleges are self-governed charitable institutions in their own right. \n All of Yale\'s 2,000 undergraduate courses are open to members of any college. \n The dominant architecture of the residential colleges is Neo-Gothic , in line with the characteristic architecture of the university. Several colleges have other period architecture, such as Georgian and Federal , and the two most recent ( Morse and Ezra Stiles ) have modernist concrete exteriors. \n Students are assigned to a residential college in their freshman year. Only two residential colleges ( Silliman and Timothy Dwight ) house freshmen. The majority of on-campus freshmen live on the " Old Campus ", an extensive quadrangle formed by older buildings. Each residential college has its own dining hall, but students are permitted to eat in any residential college dining hall or the large dining facility called "Commons". \n Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Berkeley College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Branford College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Calhoun College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Davenport College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Jonathan Edwards College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Trumbull College \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] List of residential colleges \n This is a list of residential colleges at Yale. [ 113 ] \n \n Berkeley College , named for the Rt. Rev. George Berkeley (1685\xe2\x80\x931753), early benefactor of Yale. [ 114 ] \n Branford College , named for Branford, Connecticut , where Yale was briefly located. [ 115 ] \n Calhoun College , named for John C. Calhoun , vice-president and influential member of Congress of the United States. [ 116 ] \n Davenport College , named for Rev. John Davenport , the founder of New Haven. Often called "D\'port". [ 117 ] \n Ezra Stiles College , named for the Rev. Ezra Stiles , a president of Yale. Generally called "Stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. Its buildings were designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 118 ] \n Jonathan Edwards College , named for theologian, Yale alumnus, and Princeton co-founder Jonathan Edwards . Generally called "J.E." The oldest of the residential colleges, J.E. is the only college with an independent endowment, the Jonathan Edwards Trust. [ 119 ] \n Morse College , named for Samuel F. B. Morse , inventor of Morse code and the telegraph . Also designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 120 ] \n Pierson College , named for Yale\'s first rector, Abraham Pierson . [ 121 ] A statue of Abraham Pierson stands on Yale\'s Old Campus. [ 122 ] \n Saybrook College , named for Old Saybrook, Connecticut , the town in which Yale was founded. [ 123 ] \n Silliman College , named for noted scientist and Yale professor Benjamin Silliman . About half of its structures were originally part of the Sheffield Scientific School . [ 124 ] \n Timothy Dwight College , named for the two Yale presidents of that name, Timothy Dwight IV and Timothy Dwight V . Often abbreviated "T.D." [ 125 ] \n Trumbull College , named for Jonathan Trumbull , first Governor of Connecticut. [ 126 ] \n \n \nIn 1998, Yale launched a series of extensive renovations to the older residential buildings, which in many decades of existence had seen only routine maintenance and incremental improvements to plumbing, heating, and electrical and network wiring. Many of these renovations have now been completed, and among other improvements, renovated colleges feature newly built basement facilities including snack bars called "butteries," game rooms, theaters, athletic facilities, fine arts studios, and music practice rooms. \n In June 2008, President Levin announced that the Yale Corporation had authorized the construction of two new residential colleges, scheduled to open in 2013. The additional colleges, to be built in the northern part of the campus, will allow for expanded admission and a reduction of crowding in the existing residential colleges. [ 127 ] Designs have been released, and some public controversy has surfaced over Yale\'s decision to demolish a number of historic buildings on the site, including a recently constructed library, in order to clear it for the $600&#160;million new structures. [ 128 ] \n [ edit ] Student organizations \n Main article: List of Yale University student organizations \n The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The latter categories include the Yale Daily News , which was first published in 1878, the weekly Yale Herald , published since 1986, and The Yale Record , which was established in 1872 and is America\'s oldest college humor magazine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition [ 129 ] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio [ 130 ] is the campus\'s radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM &amp; FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. \n The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki . The Yale International Relations Association functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. \n The campus also includes several fraternities and sororities . The campus features at least 18 a&#160;cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs , who are unusual among college singing groups in being made up solely of senior men. \n Yale\'s secret societies include Skull and Bones , Scroll and Key , Wolf\'s Head , Book and Snake , Elihu , Berzelius , St.&#160;Elmo , Manuscript , and Mace and Chain . The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916). [ 131 ] \n The Elizabethan Club , a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the "Lizzie\'s" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, a first edition of Milton\'s Paradise Lost , among other important literary texts. \n [ edit ] Traditions \n Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their " bright college years ". [ 132 ] ("Bright College Years," the University\'s alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand , Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein .) Yale\'s student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus. Actual students rarely do so. [ 133 ] In the second half of the twentieth century Bladderball , a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009 and 2011, but its future remains uncertain. [ 134 ] \n [ edit ] Athletics \n \n \n \n  \nThe Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex. \n \n \n Main article: Yale Bulldogs \n Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference , the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association . Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division&#160;I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. \n Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation\'s first natural "bowl" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl ), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium , the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world. [ 135 ] October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale\'s fourth new boathouse in 157&#160;years of collegiate rowing. The Richard Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder&#160;\'79 and her father Richard Gilder&#160;\'54, who gave $4&#160;million towards the $7.5&#160;million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men\'s team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race . \n Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men\'s eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club , founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. \n In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school\'s ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game. [ 136 ] \n For kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played bladderball . [ 137 ] \n Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee , by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] \n [ edit ] Song \n Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement , convocation , alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, " Bright College Years ", and the Yale fight song , "Down the Field." \n Two other fight songs, "Bulldog, Bulldog" and "Bingo Eli Yale", written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days, are still sung at football games. Another fight song sung at games is " Boola Boola ". According to \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1998, \xe2\x80\x9cDown the Field\xe2\x80\x9d ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time. [ 140 ] \n [ edit ] Mascot \n The school mascot is " Handsome Dan ", the known Yale bulldog , and the Yale fight song (written by Cole Porter while he was a student at Yale) contains the refrain , "Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow." The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue . [ 141 ] Yale\'s Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889. [ 142 ] \n Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band . "Precision" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching. [ 143 ] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. \n Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. \n [ edit ] Notable people \n [ edit ] Benefactors \n Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale ; Jeremiah Dummer ; the Harkness family ( Edward , Anna , and William ); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling ; Payne Whitney ; Joseph E. Sheffield , Paul Mellon , Charles B.&#160;G. Murphy and William K. Lanman . The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder , donated $70&#160;million in commemoration of their 50th&#160;reunion.

Kennedy Street. It is the historic center of Cambridge. [ 2 ] Adjacent to Harvard Yard , the historic heart of Harvard University , [ 3 ] the Square (as it is sometimes called locally) functions as a commercial center for Harvard students, as well as residents of western Cambridge and the inner western and northern suburbs of Boston . These residents use the Harvard station , a major MBTA Red Line subway and bus transportation hub . \n In an extended sense, the name "Harvard Square" can also refer to the entire neighborhood surrounding this intersection for several blocks in each direction. The nearby Cambridge Common has become a park area with a playground, baseball field, and a number of monuments, several relating to the Revolutionary War . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n 2 Transformation \n 3 Other features \n 4 In film \n 5 See also \n 6 Gallery \n 7 Notes \n 8 References \n 9 Further reading \n 10 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n \n \n \n  \n1873 Map of Harvard Square \n \n \n Although today a commercial center, the Square had famous residents in earlier periods, including the colonial poet Anne Bradstreet . The high pedestrian traffic makes it a gathering place for street musicians and buskers; singer-songwriters Tracy Chapman , who attended nearby Tufts University , is known to have played here during her college years; [ citation needed ] Amanda Palmer performed here as a " living statue ". \n Until 1984, the Harvard Square stop was the northern terminus of the Red Line , and it still functions as a major transfer station between subway, bus, and trackless trolley. Automobile traffic can be heavy, and parking is difficult. Most of the bus lines serving the area from the north and west run through a tunnel adjacent to the subway tunnel. Originally built for streetcars (which last ran in 1958) and still used by trackless trolleys as well as ordinary buses, the tunnel lessens bus traffic in central Harvard Square, and lets buses cross the Square without encountering automobile traffic. The tunnel also allows safer and covered access between the subway and the buses. \n [ edit ] Transformation \n \n \n \n \n \n This section needs additional citations for verification .

(July 2011)  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nHarvard Square \n \n \n Discussions of how the Square has changed in recent years usually center on the perceived gentrification of the Harvard Square neighborhood and Cambridge in general. \n The Square also used to be a neighborhood shopping center, including a grocery store (Sages) and a Woolworth\'s five and ten . Although a hardware store (Dickson Hardware at 26 Brattle Street), drug stores and bank branches remain, the Square is mainly a regional rather than neighborhood shopping destination, attracting students and commuters. \n In 1981 and 1987 the Harvard Square Theater was converted into a multiplex cinema; it later became part of the Loews Cineplex Entertainment chain and then closed on July 8, 2012. [ 4 ] During the late 1990s, some locally run businesses with long-time shopfronts on the Square\xe2\x80\x94including the unusual Tasty Diner , a tiny sandwich shop open long hours, and the Wursthaus, a German restaurant with an extensive beer menu\xe2\x80\x94closed to make way for national chains. Elsie\'s Lunch, a long-popular deli, has also closed; what remained of its small corner storefront space facing Lowell House on Mount Auburn Street is now occupied by an ATM. \n The student co-op, the Harvard Coop , founded in 1882, is now managed by Barnes &amp; Noble . Schoenhof\'s Foreign Books is owned by the French \xc3\x89ditions Gallimard . Paperback Booksmith and Reading International closed by the end of the 1990s. [ 5 ] The independent WordsWorth Books at 30 Brattle Street closed in 2004 after 29 years as a fixture in the Square. [ 6 ] In the same year, the famous Grolier Poetry Bookshop announced that it would be sold (although it survived under new management). Globe Corner Bookstore transitioned to an online business, serving its last bricks-and-mortar customer on July 4, 2011. \n Following national trends, the former Harvard Trust Company bank has been absorbed into the national Bank of America through a series of mergers. The iconic Out of Town News is owned by the UK-based Hudson Group . Still, a few establishments, such as Leavitt &amp; Pierce tobacconists (est. 1883), Laflamme Barber Shop (est. 1898), Harvard Book Store (est. 1932), Cardullo\'s Gourmet Shoppe (est. 1950), Charlie\'s Kitchen (est. 1951), the Brattle Theater (est. 1953), the Hong Kong Chinese restaurant (est. 1954), Club Passim (est. 1958), Caf\xc3\xa9 Pamplona (est. 1959), Mrs. Bartley\'s Burger Cottage (est. 1960), Dickson Brothers Hardware (est. 1961), Algiers Coffee House (est. 1970), and Grendel\'s Den (est. 1971) remain as longstanding, locally-run businesses with unique styles. \n [ edit ] Other features \n \n \n \n \n \n This section needs additional citations for verification .

(July 2011)  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nChess players in Harvard Square \n \n \n At the center of the Square is the old Harvard Square Subway Kiosk , now a newsstand, Out of Town News , stocking newspapers and magazines from around the world. A video of it appears in transitional clips used on CNN . A public motion art installation, Lumen Eclipse , has been introduced at the Tourist Information Booth showing monthly exhibitions of local, national and international artists. \n In the southwest area of the Square neighborhood, on Mount Auburn St, stands the Igor Fokin Memorial. [ 7 ] This memorial, created by sculptor Konstantin Simun , pays tribute not only to the late "beloved puppeteer," but to all street performers that are an integral part of the square, especially during summer months. \n \n \n \n  \nThe offices of Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe, home of the radio show Car Talk \n \n \n The office of NPR \'s Car Talk radio show faces the square, with a stencil in the window that reads " Dewey, Cheetham &amp; Howe ," the fictional law firm often referenced on the show. The popular show references this by asking its viewers to send in answers to the "Puzzler" to "Puzzler Tower, Car Talk Plaza, Harvard Square, Cambridge (our fair city), MA 02138". \n The sunken region next to the newsstand and the subway entrance is called "The Pit." Its arena-like appearance attracts skateboarders and, more generally, young, high-school aged people from surrounding neighborhoods who are associated with countercultural movements such as the punk , hardcore, straight edge , and goth subcultures. The contrast between these congregants and the often older and more conservatively dressed people associated with nearby Harvard University and the businesses in the Square occasionally leads to tension. Harvard sports teams and clubs, including the track teams and all-male social clubs, are known to make use of this contrast through encouraging or sometimes forcing their newest members to engage in humorous or humiliating performances in "The Pit" as part of these members\' initiations into the group. Across the street to the east of the pit, an outdoor cafe features always-busy tables for chess players, including Murray Turnbull, with his ever-present "Play the Chessmaster" sign. \n A number of other public squares dot the surrounding streets, notably Brattle Square and Winthrop Square, [ note 1 ] with a wide variety of street performers throughout the year. Brattle Street itself is home to the Brattle Theater (a non-profit arthouse theater ) and the American Repertory Theater . The John F. Kennedy Memorial Park, one block further down JFK Street, is on the bank of the Charles River. Cambridge Common is two blocks north. \n The Square often attracts activists for unconventional political factions and has its share of panhandlers . Although Tom Magliozzi has derided it as "the bum capital of the world", it\'s also very likely one of the world\'s best places to people-watch, having many benches, terraces, and sidewalk restaurants and cafes dedicated for that purpose, and an affluent, ambient shopping population to sustain most anyone\'s interest. \n "The Garage" is a small, multi-story shopping mall , named thus because it was formerly a parking garage . The original car ramp has been preserved, and is a central feature of this adaptive reuse project. One of the main attractions in The Garage is a Newbury Comics store. \n [ edit ] In film \n The 1969 film Goodbye, Columbus takes place in Harvard Square near the film\'s conclusion, after the Richard Benjamin character learns that his girlfriend, Brenda Potimkin, an undergraduate at Radcliffe College played by Katharine Ross , left her diaphragm in the top drawer of her bureau at home for her mother to discover. \n The 1970 film Love Story , by the late Harvard alumnus and Yale University professor of classics Erich Segal , takes place almost entirely in and around Harvard Square during its first two-thirds, while Harvard undergraduates Oliver Barrett and Jenny Cavalieri meet; finish college; get married; and Oliver goes to Harvard Law School while Jenny teaches school, living in a second-story walk-up in what looks like Watertown . The film continues to be screened annually to incoming freshmen at Harvard College during orientation week. \n The 1973 film The Paper Chase , set at Harvard Law School , features Harvard Square landmarks of its era, including the old Out of Town Newsstand, the old MBTA Harvard station kiosk with its "8 Minutes to Park Street" sign, and the now-defunct Kupersmith\'s Florists. \n The 1977 film Between the Lines features similar Harvard Square footage as well as aerial footage of the Back Bay. \n The 1994 film With Honors has a scene filmed in Harvard Square in which the Out of Town Newsstand is featured. In the scene, Monty approaches Simon as he (Simon) is attempting to sell newspapers he took out of a vending machine. \n Various parts of the 1997 film Good Will Hunting were filmed in and around Harvard Square, most notably at the former Tasty Sandwich Shop and the outdoor seating area of the square\'s largest Au Bon Pain caf\xc3\xa9. \n The 2005 documentary film Touching History; Harvard Square, the Bank, and The Tasty Diner chronicles the changing face of the Square, as a small diner (The Tasty) closes its doors to make way for a large retail space. [ 8 ] \n Ben Affleck shot portions of his film The Town (2010) in Grendel\'s Den on Winthrop Street, locally famous in the 1970s for its chocolate fondue . [ 9 ] \n The 2010 film The Social Network featured aerial footage of the area near Holyoke Center. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n National Register of Historic Places listings in Cambridge, Massachusetts \n Orson Welles Cinema \n William Brattle House \n \n [ edit ] Gallery \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harvard Square in 1869 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harvard Square, May 2004 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harvard Square on a rainy day \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Harvard Book Store at dusk \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Loews Movie Theatre , Church Street \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Notes \n \n \n ^  Brattle Square, Harvard Square, and Winthrop Square are at the three corners of the triangular block formed by Brattle Street, JFK Street, and Mt.

\r\n \r\n \r\n Thousands of Harvard Kennedy School graduates are changing the world in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors with their leadership skills and through their commitment to public service. The HKS degree programs aim to provide students with the necessary skills in analysis, management, and advocacy and with an ability to call on these skills under ever-changing circumstances. \r\n Harvard Kennedy School leads the global search for innovative, effective means of governance. We generate ideas and bring them into the classroom, where we train the next generation of leaders for public service. We also test our ideas in practice. Our faculty is engaged in the affairs of the world, shaping public policy, advising governments, and running major institutions. \r\n Harvard Kennedy School has also emerged as a forum for passionate debate. An impressive international roster of leaders visits us each year to share their ideas with our students, and with the world. Our student body represents over 80 countries from every region of the world, bringing diverse perspectives to HKS. \r\n Life both inside and outside the classroom at HKS prepares students for significant leadership positions in public service. Beyond the classroom, students immerse themselves in the rich HKS community by joining clubs and caucuses, student government, and by attending events hosted by the 15 policy research centers housed on campus, including Harvard&rsquo;s Institute of Politics. \r\n Through the efforts of our faculty, the energy of our students, and the accomplishments of our graduates, Harvard Kennedy School leads change by joining compelling ideas and excellent practice. \r\n We invite you to join us and ask what you can do. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n Additional Information \r\n The Harvard Kennedy School is a member of the Public Policy &amp; International Affairs (PPIA) Graduate School Consortium and the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA) \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    \r\n     \r\n    \r\n   \r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   email \n  \n  \t\t\t\t\t   \n   \t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Applying to the Harvard Kennedy School \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Harvard Kennedy School uses an online application .

When people refer to Harvard students, often they mean the subset of roughly 6,400 students who attend Harvard College. Students arrive every year in late August. \n Harvard College\xe2\x80\x99s diverse student population makes it hard to describe the typical student and even harder to describe the quintessential Harvard student experience. Students come from all 50 states and from over 80 countries; from cities, suburbs, small towns and farms; from public, private and parochial schools; from every ethnic and religious background; and from across the economic spectrum. Based on longstanding tradition and an extensive financial aid program, Harvard is committed to making educational opportunity accessible to all, with over 60% of the undergraduate population receiving financial aid. \n With over 400 official student organizations including extra-curriculars, co-curricular and athletic opportunities in addition to academics, Harvard students are active around and beyond campus. Whether in Harvard Stadium playing on the field or cheering on The Harvard Crimson , volunteering through organizations like PBHA , fostering entrepreneurial activities in the Harvard innovation lab , writing or editing at The Harvard Crimson or The Harvard Lampoon , or researching in one of the many labs, Harvard students are continuously learning \xe2\x80\x94 and constantly busy! \n Demographics for the class of 2016: \n \n 17% are from New England \n 22% are from the Mid Atlantic \n 19% are from the South \n 10% are from the Midwest \n 21% are from the Western and Mountain states \n 11% are international or from U.S. territories \n \n Harvard College is committed to making a college education affordable for all admitted students. Learn more about Harvard College financial aid programs . \n The House System \n The housing system at Harvard is designed to create a full collegiate experience for all four years of undergraduate education. As freshmen, students live in one of the dormitories in Harvard Yard, a prime location, and eat in the historic and picturesque Annenberg dining hall. \n After their first year at Harvard, students are placed into one of the 12 houses on campus and continue to live there for the remainder of their residential life at Harvard. Over ninety-seven percent of Harvard undergrads choose to live on campus for all four years, creating a strong campus community and undergraduate experience. \n Each house has a resident master and a staff of tutors, and includes a dining hall, common areas, and recreational and cultural spaces that help give them each a distinct character. Many even field their own intramural sports teams or theater ensembles. The houses themselves also have unique histories and traditions that bring the students together and help to foster the close and long-lasting ties amongst the residents of each house. \n The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard College announced plans to launch the systemwide effort to renew the University\xe2\x80\x99s 12 undergraduate Houses. The announcement provides the first details about this ambitious initiative, unveiling the first full House to be renewed, the location of \xe2\x80\x9cswing\xe2\x80\x9d housing, and the pacing for the rest of the project.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n\t\t \n\t\t\n      \n \n     \n  \n\n \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Robotic insects make first controlled flight \n\t\t\t Potential diabetes breakthrough \n\t\t\t Understanding student weaknesses \n\t\t\t $50M gift from the Blavatnik Family Foundation \n\t\t\t Oh, the humanities! \n\t\t\t Subversive education \n\t\t  \n\t\t \n\t \n\t \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t Subversive education \n\t\t\t Robotic insects make first controlled flight \n\t\t\t Text of J.K.

Harvard announced the investigation publicly on August 30, 2012. [ 1 ] Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris described the case as "unprecedented in its scope and magnitude". [ 2 ]  [ 3 ]  [ 4 ]  The Harvard Crimson ranked the scandal as the news story most important to Harvard in 2012. [ 5 ] \n A teaching fellow noticed similarities between a small number of exams during grading in May 2012. [ 1 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] The course\'s professor brought the case to the Harvard College Administrative Board, which reviewed all final exams, leading to individual cases against nearly half of the 279 students enrolled in the class, almost two percent of the undergraduate student body. [ 1 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] The Administrative Board completed its investigation in December 2012. [ 7 ] On February 1, 2013 Harvard revealed that "somewhat more than half" of the students were forced to withdraw.

Platt in Spring 2010, 2011, and 2012. [ 9 ] It developed a reputation as an easy course, receiving a high proportion of "easy" or "very easy" ratings in the "Q Guide", Harvard\'s collection of course evaluations . [ 9 ]  [ 10 ] According to some Spring 2012 students, Platt immediately confirmed this reputation by promising 120 A \'s and stating that attendance was optional. [ 3 ]  [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] Students who attended could share their notes. [ 13 ] \n Grades were determined by four take-home exams. [ 4 ]  [ 9 ] In 2010 and 2011, the take-home exams were essays, but in 2012 they were changed to a short answer format. [ 9 ] The change corresponded with a spike in difficulty and a drop in overall score, according to the Q Guide. [ 9 ] Students said the short answer format facilitated collaboration. [ 4 ]  [ 9 ] \n [ edit ] Spring 2012 final exam \n The Spring 2012 final exam was assigned April 26 and due May 3 at 5pm. [ 14 ] Its first page contained the instructions: "The exam is completely open book, open note, open internet, etc. However, in all other regards, this should fall under similar guidelines that apply to in-class exams. More specifically, students may not discuss the exam with others\xe2\x80\x94this includes resident tutors, writing centers, etc." [ 4 ]  [ 14 ] The use of etc. has been questioned. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] \n Students complained about confusing questions on the final exam. [ 3 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 9 ] Due to "some good questions" from students, Platt clarified three exam questions by email on April 30. [ 9 ] Platt cancelled his office hours on the May 3 due date on short notice. [ 4 ] Many students received assistance from the teaching fellows. [ 3 ]  [ 13 ] \n [ edit ] Spring 2013 \n Government 1310 had its Spring 2013 Harvard College course listing removed as of October 7, 2012. [ 17 ] Platt is teaching the course through the Harvard Extension School . [ 18 ] Grading is based on two essay exams, ten quizzes and the final. [ 19 ] The collaboration policy forbids any collaboration. [ 19 ] \n [ edit ] Investigation \n A teaching fellow noticed similarities between a small number of exams during grading in May 2012. [ 1 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] Platt reported the suspected plagiarism in a letter to Administrative Board Secretary John "Jay" L. Ellison on May 14. [ 20 ] The similarities were first noticed in answers for the bonus short answer question "Describe two developments in the history of Congress that ostensibly gave individual MCs [members of Congress] in the House greater freedom and/or control but ultimately centralized power in the hands of party leadership." [ 20 ] Some students picked the "somewhat obscure" pair of the Cannon Revolt of 1910 and Henry Clay and "all the answers use the same (incorrect) reading of the course material in arguments that are identically structured." [ 20 ] Additional comparisons revealed possible collaboration on the other questions. [ 20 ] \n The Administrative Board reviewed all exams over the summer and flagged roughly 125 for suspected collaboration. [ 1 ]  [ 4 ] The students constitute nearly half of the 279 students enrolled in the class and almost two percent of Harvard College\'s undergraduate student body. [ 4 ]  [ 6 ] Harris said the similarities include "answers that look quite alike to answers that appear to have been lifted in their entirety." [ 21 ] Harvard enlisted "supplemental fact finders" to deal with the load. [ 22 ] Peter F. Lake, a Stetson University College of Law professor approximated fifty hours per student totaling "essentially one administrator\xe2\x80\x99s entire year of energy." [ 22 ] \n Harvard announced the investigation publicly on August 30, 2012. [ 1 ] Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris justified the announcement as a springboard to raise awareness and a teachable moment . [ 4 ]  [ 23 ] A senior under investigation dismissed this explanation, writing, "Harvard chose to go public with this story to first and foremost save their own asses." [ 11 ] \n On the same day as the announcement, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith sent an email to all faculty members informing them of the investigation and suggesting that they clarify their collaboration policies. [ 4 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 24 ]  [ 25 ] \n Each student was given copies of their exams and similar ones then had to submit a written explanation. [ 26 ] The student met with an Administrative Board subcommittee and was shown the other students\' statements. [ 26 ] Some students named the classmates they collaborated with. [ 26 ] The subcommittee recommended an action to the full board. [ 26 ] \n Cases were finalized in September and December 2012. [ 26 ] Students forced to withdraw vanished from campus as verdicts were issued every Tuesday. [ 13 ] The Administrative Board completed its investigation in December 2012. [ 7 ] \n [ edit ] Discipline \n Potential discipline for academic dishonesty includes a year\'s forced withdrawal. [ 1 ]  [ 4 ]  [ 27 ] In May 2010 the Administrative Board gained the ability to "exclude" students and fail them. [ 27 ]  IvyGate published rumors that the Administrative Board developed a "tiered punishment scheme" based on general classes of collaboration but Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal stated that each case would be evaluated individually. [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] \n Students could withdraw voluntarily before their cases are closed, according to an email sent by Ellison to resident deans. [ 23 ] If convicted and sentenced to a required withdrawal, the leave of absence would be credited as time served . [ 23 ] A forced withdrawal includes a permanent notation on the student\'s transcript. [ 30 ] Harvard biology professor Richard Losick calls the note "a severe punishment" and one suspected student describes it as "almost the kiss of death in the academic realm." [ 30 ] During their absence, students must "hold a full-time, paid, non-academic job in a non-family situation, for at least six consecutive months" before becoming eligible for readmittance. [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] \n On February 1, 2013 Smith revealed that "somewhat more than half" of the students were forced to withdraw "for a period of time" and "roughly half" of the remainder were put on disciplinary probation . [ 8 ]  [ 33 ] Smith\'s e-mail covers all Administrative Board cases for the past term without mentioning Government 1310 or the scandal, but a Harvard official said they were from one course. [ 8 ] For the majority of cases, the "period of time" is two semesters according to students. [ 34 ] \n [ edit ] Athletes \n Harvard Crimson varsity team athletes will lose a year of Ivy League eligibility if they play any games and are forced to withdraw. [ 23 ]  [ 35 ] If they register and attend classes before withdrawing, the Harvard Department of Athletics Student-Athlete handbook says "In nearly all circumstances, [they] will be ineligible to compete in the first year [they] return to Harvard." [ 35 ] According to estimates by students, over half the class and up to half of those suspected are athletes. [ 35 ]  [ 36 ] The Harvard Crimson football team is expected to lose players, but it won its season opener. [ 37 ]  [ 38 ]  [ 39 ] None of the starters left the team. [ 40 ]  Sports Illustrated reported that Kyle Casey, current co-captain and leading scorer of last year\'s 2011\xe2\x80\x9312 Harvard Crimson men\'s basketball team withdrew from Harvard ahead of the registration deadline. [ 41 ]  [ 42 ]  [ 43 ]  The Boston Herald reported that co-captain Brandyn Curry was expected to withdraw also. [ 44 ] On October 9, 2012 a team spokesperson confirmed that they \xe2\x80\x9care not playing this season.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 45 ]  [ 46 ] Platt highlighted a group of baseball players in his letter to the Ad Board. [ 20 ] One athlete told The Boston Globe that his teammates combined notes while traveling on their team bus. [ 36 ] Four ice hockey players including Patrick McNally and Steve Michalek left the team. [ 47 ]  [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] \n In a telephone interview with The Associated Press Harvard President Drew Faust said that athletes should not be set apart or given special treatment. [ 50 ] Faust said "It is not about one student group. It\xe2\x80\x99s not confined to any one student group." [ 50 ]  [ 51 ] Athletes and non-athletes have withdrawn voluntarily. [ 51 ] \n [ edit ] Reaction \n [ edit ] Students \n Students claimed that collaboration like note-sharing and consulting teaching fellows was widespread. [ 3 ]  [ 12 ] One student produced shared lecture notes and argued that they were the source successfully. [ 52 ] Students under investigation complained about uncertainty stemming from the length of the investigation and the Administrative Board\'s hiatus over the summer. [ 23 ] One 2012 graduate now working on Wall Street told Bloomberg Businessweek "Dragging us into this investigation now, when we have financial obligations and jobs, seems very unfair." [ 12 ] Current students expressed concerns about pro-rated tuition costs where students forced to withdraw later would pay more. [ 53 ] Some students did not receive their verdicts until shortly before finals. [ 13 ] In the interest of "financial equity," Harvard calculated tuition refunds for all required withdrawals based on September 30, 2012. [ 8 ] A Harvard Extension School student wrote to The Boston Globe to debunk claims that Platt encouraged collaborating on exams. [ 54 ] \n A number of students responded to Harvard\'s announcement by going to the media themselves and "trying to present the other side" of the story. [ 12 ] A senior reached out to The New York Observer and Salon . [ 11 ]  [ 55 ] He told Salon "we\xe2\x80\x99re being scapegoated" and that many students are ready to file lawsuits . [ 11 ] One student who had contacted a lawyer told The Harvard Crimson "Harvard has created this war between the students and the fricking school, and this is a war that I am willing and very eager to fight." [ 56 ] Experts said that Harvard can be sued for procedural errors, lost employment opportunities or intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress . [ 56 ] After the final announcement, lawyers said that lawsuits would be difficult and unlikely. [ 57 ] Harvey A. Silverglate said " Schaer vs. Brandeis makes Harvard very close to invulnerable." [ 57 ] One lawyer said students may be waiting to graduate and avoid retribution. [ 57 ] The statute of limitations for breach of contract is six years in Massachusetts. [ 57 ] \n Implicated students and parents were disappointed by Smith\'s e-mail and blamed Platt. [ 34 ]  [ 58 ] Other students thought the punishment was fair. [ 31 ]  [ 34 ] Robert Peabody, an attorney for two students said the process was too slow and calling it " death by a thousand nicks ," "living torture ," "basically hell" and "twisting in the wind." [ 26 ]  [ 59 ] He said his clients "emotionally deteriorated over the course of the semester.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 52 ] \n [ edit ] Harvard \n An honor code has been under consideration by Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Committee on Academic Integrity, but professors interviewed in the wake of the scandal said that it would be ineffective against cheating. [ 60 ]  [ 61 ]  Colin Diver , former president of Reed College writes that an "Honor Principle" must be the basis of a culture of academic integrity . [ 62 ] Some professors defended the take-home exam format. [ 63 ] \n Erika Christakis and Nicholas A. Christakis write that there is a "national crisis of academic dishonesty." [ 64 ]  Harry R. Lewis entreats Harvard to " Know Thyself ." [ 65 ]  Howard Gardner writes that the case exposes "ethical rot" at Harvard. [ 66 ] Gardner contemplates the scandal "as a play in four acts ." [ 67 ] \n Faust, Smith and Harris made statements regarding the investigation at the first Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting of Fall 2012 on October 2. [ 68 ] Faust also granted an interview with The Harvard Crimson . [ 69 ] She refused comment on student athletes saying the investigation "includes a wide spectrum of students." [ 69 ] \n The instructors of Harvard\'s Expository Writing Program are using the scandal to accentuate the anti-plagiarism principles they have already been teaching. [ 70 ] \n [ edit ] Thomas G. Stemberg \n Thomas G. Stemberg , prominent Harvard alumnus and Staples Inc. founder wrote a heavily critical letter addressed to Faust dated January 6, 2013. [ 71 ]  [ 72 ] Stemberg is co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Basketball fundraising group. [ 71 ]  [ 73 ] The 2012\xe2\x80\x9313 Harvard Crimson men\'s basketball team lost two stars to the scandal. [ 71 ] Stemberg criticized Harvard for punishing students who used collaborative notes alongside those who copied answers. [ 71 ]  [ 72 ] He alleged that students had escaped punishment by lying in their testimony. [ 72 ] He called Platt and other undergraduate instructors "clearly not qualified." [ 71 ]  [ 72 ] Stemberg said to Bloomberg News "Those students who cut and pasted exam answers deserved to get kicked out. The rest of them should have been vindicated, and the faculty member fired." [ 26 ] The other co-chair Thomas W. Mannix disapproved of how the media focused on the basketball team and individual players. [ 74 ] \n [ edit ] Commentary \n Editorials by The Harvard Crimson call out widespread confusion over the acceptability of collaboration as the scandal\'s root cause [ 75 ] and focus on extracurricular activity . [ 76 ] An editorial by The Cavalier Daily blames the "poorly-worded exam instructions" and the phrase "open Internet". [ 77 ] According to an editorial by The Boston Globe , the cheating exposes a lack of quality in Government 1310. [ 78 ] An editorial by The Christian Science Monitor examines the challenges of teaching integrity. [ 79 ]  Naomi Schaefer Riley writes in Bloomberg View that the scandal highlights problems in the college admissions process. [ 80 ]  Farhad Manjoo , writing for Slate , believes "The students should be celebrated for collaborating" as they would in the real world. [ 81 ] Sarah Green writes in Harvard Business Review that a developed love of learning would prevent cheating. [ 82 ]  Forbes contributor Richard Levick blames Harvard for drawing out the investigation and failing to maintain confidentiality. [ 83 ]  Alexandra Petri writes in The Washington Post that cheating is caused by an aversion to failure. [ 84 ] In The Boston Globe , Lauren Stiller Rikleen blames the Millenial Generation \'s inexperience with a lack of structure. [ 85 ] A number of student newspapers published opinion pieces on cheating inspired by the event. [ 86 ]  [ 87 ]  [ 88 ]  [ 89 ]  Jonathan Zimmerman of the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University writes in The Christian Science Monitor that "poor teaching" encourages cheating. [ 90 ] \n On February 11, 2013 The Daily Show did a segment on the scandal. [ 91 ] \n [ edit ] Yale \n The Yale Freshman Class Council designed a shirt for the Harvard-Yale football game replacing " Veritas " in the Harvard logo with "Cheaters" or "Cheatas" but the Yale Licensing Office rejected the design. [ 92 ]  [ 93 ]  [ 94 ] The approved shirt has "Try cheating your way out of this one" on its back. [ 94 ] Harvard won the game. [ 95 ] \n Yale College Dean Mary Miller discouraged instructors from using take-home finals in direct response to the scandal. [ 96 ]  [ 97 ] \n [ edit ] Administrative Board \n On October 23\xe2\x80\x9326, 2012 The Harvard Crimson published a four-part series about the Administrative Board and the changes made in 2009-2010. [ 98 ]  [ 99 ]  [ 100 ]  [ 101 ]  The Harvard Crimson followed up with a critical editorial. [ 102 ] One criticism is resident deans are normally trusted advisors but communications with them are not protected by privilege . [ 13 ]  [ 99 ]  [ 102 ] \n [ edit ] Collaboration policies \n On August 30, 2012 the same day as the announcement, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith sent an email to all faculty members informing them of the investigation and suggesting that they clarify their collaboration policies. [ 4 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 24 ]  [ 25 ] \n Harris reminded instructors that course syllabi must contain explicit collaboration policies before the Spring 2013 semester. [ 103 ]  [ 104 ] Some classes also went over their policies in their first lecture. [ 103 ] \n [ edit ] Search of dean\'s email accounts \n On March 9, 2013 The Boston Globe reported that Harvard searched 16 resident dean\'s email accounts seeking the source of a leaked email shortly after the scandal broke. [ 105 ] On March 11 Smith and Evelynn Hammonds confirmed the search in an official statement. [ 106 ]  [ 107 ] One dean had forwarded the email to two students in their role as an advisor and it was redistributed, reaching The Harvard Crimson . [ 105 ]  [ 106 ]  [ 107 ] In light of a second leak of an Administrative Board meeting and with no explanations forthcoming, administrators approved the email search. [ 106 ]  [ 107 ]  Information technology staff searched the subject lines of the deans\' staff email accounts. [ 105 ]  [ 107 ] Only the dean responsible was notified about the search. [ 105 ] The statement said Senior Resident Dean Sharon Howell was also informed but she and an anonymous Harvard official said she was not. [ 106 ] The Faculty of Arts and Sciences privacy policy requires members to be "notified at the earliest possible opportunity." [ 105 ] The policy was partially due to suspected snooping by Harvard President Lawrence Summers . [ 105 ] It was not clear if resident deans are faculty or merely staff. [ 108 ] The search breaks the faculty policy but not the staff policy. [ 109 ] Faculty members reacted negatively to the search. [ 110 ]  [ 111 ]  [ 112 ]  [ 113 ] \n Resident deans have separate administrative and personal email accounts. [ 105 ] The first search examined only the administrative account. [ 105 ]  [ 107 ] \n On April 2, 2013 Hammonds disclosed that additional searches were run on the dean\'s two email accounts seeking communication with reporters for The Harvard Crimson .

In APA style, list the author\'s name first. When no\nauthor is named, cite the issuing agency as the author. In MLA\nstyle, list the name of the government first, followed by a period,\nthen the name of the agency issuing the report (e.g., "United\nStates. Dept. of Defense"). In APA style, list the government and\nthe agency or agencies in descending order of size, separated by\ncommas (e.g., "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nAdministration for Children and Families, Office of Family\nAssistance"). MLA style allows for abbreviating agency names where\nthe meaning will be clear to the reader; APA style does not, though\nit does allow for "U.S." as an abbreviation when "United States" is\nbeing used as an adjective (e.g., U.S. Department of Energy). \n\n\n Many documents published by the federal government can be\nobtained from the Government Printing Office.

In APA, include the citation\nnumber for the case, which refers to the volume, name, and starting\npage of the court report in which the case is published. For\nexample, "370 U.S. 421" refers to an opinion published in volume\n370 of the United States Reports and beginning on page 421. In MLA\nstyle, indicate the inclusive page range for the report, rather\nthan the starting page alone. In some cases an opinion will be\npublished in multiple reports (e.g., a state and a regional\nreport). When this is the case, APA style requires that you list\nall citations; MLA style does not specify how many citations you\nshould list. \n\n\n \n\n \n Supreme Court decisions \n \n\n\n \n\n MLA Example \n\n\n Loving v.

In MLA style, indicate\nthe type of document (e.g., "Diss." for a doctoral dissertation and\n"MA thesis" or "MS thesis" for a master\'s thesis), the name of the\ndegree-granting institution, and the year in which the dissertation\nwas submitted (which may be different from the year of\npublication). In APA style, indicate "Doctoral dissertation" or\n"Master\'s thesis" and the name of the degree-granting institution.\nIf the dissertation is available through an online database,\ninclude the name of the database in both APA and MLA styles.\nAdditionally, in APA style include the accession or order number,\nif it\'s available. \n\n\n \n\n MLA Examples \n\n\n Ivers, Gregg.

Available from\nProQuest Dissertations and Theses database. (AAT No. 3118507) \n\n \n\n\n \n\n Unpublished dissertations \n\n\n To cite an unpublished dissertation in MLA style, enclose the\ntitle in quotation marks (rather than italicizing it) and write\n"Diss." followed by the name of the degree-granting institution. In\nAPA style, add the note "Unpublished doctoral dissertation" or\n"Unpublished master\'s thesis" in parentheses after the italicized\ntitle and indicate the name as well as the location of the\ndegree-granting institution. \n\n\n \n\n MLA Example \n\n\n Donaldson, Morgaen.

Instead, cite the\nauthor, the term "personal communication," and the date of the\ncorrespondence within the text of your paper. \n\n\n \n\n APA Example \n\n\n \n\n "According to M.

Founded in 1701 in the Colony of Connecticut , the university is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States . \n Originally chartered as the "Collegiate School", the institution traces its roots to 17th-century clergymen who sought to establish a college to train clergy and political leaders for the colony. In 1718, the College was renamed "Yale College" to honor a gift from Elihu Yale , a governor of the British East India Company . In 1861, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences became the first U.S. institution to award the PhD. [ 4 ] Yale became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. Yale College was transformed, beginning in the 1930s, through the establishment of residential colleges : 12 now exist and two more are planned. Yale employs over 1,100 faculty to teach and advise about 5,300 undergraduate and 6,100 graduate and professional students . Almost all tenured professors teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually. [ 5 ]  [ 6 ] \n The University\'s assets include an endowment valued at $19.4&#160;billion as of 2011 [update] , [ 7 ] the second-largest of any academic institution in the world. Yale\'s system of more than two dozen libraries holds 12.5&#160;million volumes. [ 8 ] 49 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with the University as students, faculty, and staff. Yale has produced many notable alumni , including five U.S. Presidents , 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices , and several foreign heads of state. At the graduate level, Yale Law School , Yale School of Art , and Yale School of Drama are consistently ranked the top programs in their field. Yale Law School is the most selective law school in the United States. [ 9 ] \n Yale students compete intercollegiately as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League .

Soon thereafter, a group of ten Congregationalist ministers: Samuel Andrew , Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather, James Noyes , James Pierpont , Abraham Pierson , Noadiah Russell , Joseph Webb and Timothy Woodbridge , all of whom were alumni of Harvard , met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell in Branford, Connecticut , to pool their books to form the school\'s first library. [ 10 ] The group, led by James Pierpont , is now known as "The Founders". \n Originally called the "Collegiate School", the institution opened in the home of its first rector , Abraham Pierson , [ 11 ] in Killingworth (now Clinton ). The school moved to Saybrook , and then Wethersfield . In 1718 the college moved to New Haven, Connecticut . \n \n \n \n  \nFirst diploma awarded by Yale College , granted to Nathaniel Chauncey, 1702. \n \n \n Meanwhile, a rift was forming at Harvard between its sixth president Increase Mather and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity . The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not. [ 12 ] \n In 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony\'s Governor Gurdon Saltonstall , Cotton Mather contacted a successful businessman in Wales named Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer , Yale, who had made a fortune through trade while living in India as a representative of the East India Company , donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than \xc2\xa3560, a substantial sum at the time. Yale also donated 417&#160;books and a portrait of King George&#160;I . Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to Yale College in gratitude to its benefactor, and to increase the chances that he would give the college another large donation or bequest. Elihu Yale was away in India when the news of the school\'s name change reached his home in Wrexham , Wales, a trip from which he never returned. While he did ultimately leave his fortunes to the "Collegiate School within His Majesties Colony of Connecticot", [ citation needed ] the institution was never able to successfully lay claim to it. \n \n \n \n  \nOld Brick Row in 1807. \n \n \n [ edit ] Curriculum \n Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period\xe2\x80\x94the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment \xe2\x80\x94thanks to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles . They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale, while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for endowment, and fights with the Connecticut legislature . [ 13 ] \n Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language , along with Greek and Latin , and essential for study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles , president of the College from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase \xd7\x90\xd7\x95\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d \xd7\x95\xd7\xaa\xd7\x9e\xd7\x99\xd7\x9d ( Urim and Thummim ) on the Yale seal. Stiles\' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when hostile British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the College. Fortunately, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning , Secretary to the British General in command of the occupation, interceded and the College was saved. Fanning later was granted an honorary degree LL.D. , at 1803, [ 14 ] for his efforts. \n \n \n \n  \n Woolsey Hall in c. 1905 \n \n \n [ edit ] Students \n As the only college in Connecticut, Yale educated the sons of the elite. [ 15 ] Offenses for which students were punished included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During the period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side. [ 16 ] \n The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753, and Brothers in Unity in 1768. [ 17 ] \n [ edit ] 19th century \n \n \n \n  \nMen leaning on the old Yale fence facing Chapel Street, c.&#160;1874. \n \n \n The Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. At the same time, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. [ 18 ] At the same time a group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the \'isms\' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without. [ 19 ] Perhaps the most well-remembered [ citation needed ] teacher was William Graham Sumner , professor from 1872 to 1909. He taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. He bested President Noah Porter , who disliked social science and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education, 1879\xe2\x80\x9381. Porter objected to Sumner\'s use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might intellectually, morally, and religiously harm students. [ 20 ] \n [ edit ] Sports and debate \n The Revolutionary War hero Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the prototype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th&#160;century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who regretted he had but one life to lose for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself. [ 21 ] \n Along with Harvard and Princeton , Yale students rejected elite British concepts about \'amateurism\' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football. [ 22 ] The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry began in 1875. \n \n \n \n  \nYale\'s four-oared crew team, posing with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy , won at Philadelphia . \n \n \n Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in the first intercollegiate debate, and 1909, the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart. [ 23 ] \n In 1909\xe2\x80\x9310, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905\xe2\x80\x9306 to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries. [ 24 ] \n [ edit ] Expansion \n \n \n \n  \nConnecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753. \n \n \n Yale expanded gradually, establishing the Yale School of Medicine (1810), Yale Divinity School (1822), Yale Law School (1843), Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (1847), the Sheffield Scientific School (1847), [ 25 ] and the Yale School of Fine Arts (1869). In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of Timothy Dwight&#160;V , Yale College was renamed Yale University. The university would later add the Yale School of Music (1894), the Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1901), the Yale School of Public Health (1915), the Yale School of Nursing (1923), the Yale School of Drama (1955), the Yale Physician Associate Program (1973), and the Yale School of Management (1976). It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School. \n Expansion caused controversy about Yale\'s new roles. Noah Porter , moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter\'s contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. [ 26 ] He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university. \n \n \n \n  \nAerial view from the south, 1906. \n \n \n [ edit ] 20th century \n [ edit ] Behavioral sciences \n Between 1925 and 1940, philanthropic foundations , especially ones connected with the Rockefellers , contributed about $7&#160;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology . The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to "improve mankind" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President James R. Angell and psychobiologist Robert M. Yerkes , tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control, sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences. [ 27 ] \n [ edit ] Biology \n Slack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison , Grace E. Pickford , and G.&#160;Evelyn Hutchinson , and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison\'s group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford\'s and Hutchinson\'s were not. Pickford\'s group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson\'s example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research. [ 28 ] \n [ edit ] Medicine \n Milton Winternitz led the Yale Medical School as its dean from 1920 to 1935. An innovative, even maverick, leader, he not only kept the school from going under but also turned it into a first-class research institution. [ citation needed ] Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department, and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign. [ 29 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty \n Before World War&#160;II , most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions. [ 30 ] \n [ edit ] History and American Studies \n The American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. Norman Holmes Pearson , who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose. [ 31 ] Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire William R. Coe made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming. Coe was concerned to celebrate the \'values\' of the Western United States in order to meet the "threat of communism." [ 32 ] \n [ edit ] Women \n Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences . [ 33 ] \n In 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female, declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969. [ 34 ] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate; [ 35 ] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall . \n A decade into co-education, rampant student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale . While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale\'s Grievance Board and the Yale Women\'s Center. [ 36 ] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale. [ 37 ] \n [ edit ] Class \n Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to increase the proportion of white Protestants of notable families in the student body (see numerus clausus ), and was one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970. [ 38 ] \n [ edit ] Town-gown relations \n Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale\'s exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven\'s efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy. [ 39 ] \n [ edit ] Yale in the 21st century \n In 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students. [ 40 ] In July 2012, the Peking University-Yale University Program ended due to weak participation. [ 40 ] \n In 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale\'s institutional priorities: "First, among the nation\'s finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders." [ 41 ] \n The Boston Globe wrote that "if there\'s one school that can lay claim to educating the nation\'s top national leaders over the past three decades, it\'s Yale." [ 42 ]  Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. Presidential election between 1972 and 2004. Yale-educated Presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford , George H.W. Bush , Bill Clinton , and George W. Bush , and major-party nominees during this period include John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (Vice President, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (Vice President, 1972). Other Yale alumni who made serious bids for the Presidency during this period include Hillary Rodham Clinton (2008), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992). \n Several explanations have been offered for Yale\xe2\x80\x99s representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates. [ 43 ] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale\xe2\x80\x99s focus on creating "a laboratory for future leaders," an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster . [ 43 ]  Richard H. Brodhead , former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University , stated: "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale." [ 42 ] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes "an ethos of organized activity" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union \'s Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily News . [ 44 ]  Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: "It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school." [ 45 ] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the "son and grandson of alumni", and for a "member of a politically influential family." [ 46 ]  New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and The Atlantic Monthly correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others. [ 47 ] \n During the 1988 presidential election, George H.&#160;W. Bush (Yale \'48) derided Michael Dukakis for having "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard\'s boutique". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis\'s Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale\'s reputation was "so diffuse, there isn\'t a symbol, I don\'t think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said Yale did not share Harvard\'s reputation for "liberalism and elitism". [ 48 ]  [ 49 ] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, "In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of \'68 and the class of \'71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation". [ 50 ] \n In 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location \xe2\x80\x93 the others are Britain\'s Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara \xe2\x80\x93 for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation \'s United States Faith and Globalization Initiative. [ 51 ] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, "Debating Globalization". [ 52 ] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, "Understanding Politics and Politicians." [ 53 ] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London , and both schools\xe2\x80\x99 affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care\xe2\x80\x94a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but "no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL". [ 54 ] \n Yale-NUS College is a liberal arts college in Singapore set to open in August 2013 as a collaboration between Yale University and the National University of Singapore. [ 55 ]  [ 56 ]  [ 57 ] \n [ edit ] Administration and organization \n The President and Fellows of Yale College , also known as the Yale Corporation , is the governing board of the University. \n Yale\'s president Richard C. Levin is one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million. [ 58 ] \n The Yale Provost\'s Office has launched several women into prominent university presidencies. In 1977 Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed acting President of Yale from this position, and went on to become President of the University of Chicago , the first woman to be full president of a major university. In 1994 Yale Provost Judith Rodin became the first female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania . In 2002 Provost Alison Richard became the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cambridge . In 2004, Provost Susan Hockfield became the President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In 2007 Deputy Provost Kim Bottomly was named President of Wellesley College . In 2003, the Dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp , was appointed president of Colgate University and now heads Swarthmore College. \n In 2008 Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford. [ 59 ] Former Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead serves as the President of Duke University . \n [ edit ] Staff and labor unions \n Main article: Federation of Hospital and University Employees \n Much of Yale University\'s staff, including most maintenance staff, dining hall employees, and administrative staff, are unionized . Clerical and technical employees are represented by Local&#160;34 of Unite Here and service and maintenance workers by Local&#160;35 of the same international . Together with the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (GESO), an unrecognized union of graduate employees, Locals&#160;34 and 35 make up the Federation of Hospital and University Employees . Also included in FHUE are the dietary workers at Yale-New Haven Hospital , who are members of 1199 SEIU . [ 60 ] In addition to these unions, officers of the Yale University Police Department are members of the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees. [ 61 ] Finally, Yale security officers voted to join the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in fall 2010 after the National Labor Relations Board ruled they could not join AFSCME ; the Yale administration contested the election. [ 62 ] \n Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes. [ 63 ] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S. [ 64 ] Yale\'s unusually large endowment exacerbates the tension over wages. Moreover, Yale has been accused of failing to treat workers with respect. [ 65 ] In a 2003 strike, however, the university claimed that more union employees were working than striking. [ 66 ] Professor David Graeber was \'retired\' after he came to the defense of a student who was involved in campus labor issues. [ 67 ] \n [ edit ] Campus \n \n \n \n  \n Yale Law School . \n \n \n Yale\'s central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1&#160;km 2 ). An additional 500 acres (2.0&#160;km 2 ) includes the Yale golf course and nature preserves in rural Connecticut and Horse Island . [ 68 ] \n Yale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus [ 69 ] as well as for several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn \'s Yale Art Gallery [ 70 ] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen \'s Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph\'s Art &amp; Architecture Building . Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue , which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s. \n Many of Yale\'s buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness [ 71 ] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers , faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid, [ 72 ] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages , and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower , 216 feet (66&#160;m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon . \n \n \n \n  \n Vanderbilt Hall at the Yale university \n \n \n Other examples of the Gothic (also called neo-Gothic and collegiate Gothic) style are on Old Campus by such architects as Henry Austin , Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis . Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family , including Vanderbilt Hall, [ 73 ] Phelps Hall, [ 74 ]  St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt ), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College , the largest residential college. [ 75 ] \n \n \n \n  \nStatue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall \n \n \n The oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style . Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College , Pierson College , and Davenport College , except the latter\'s east, York Street fa\xc3\xa7ade, which was constructed in the Gothic style . \n The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library , designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill , is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. [ 76 ] It is located near the center of the University in Hewitt Quadrangle , which is now more commonly referred to as " Beinecke Plaza ". \n The library\'s six-story above-ground tower of book stacks is surrounded by a windowless rectangular building with walls made of translucent Vermont marble, which transmit subdued lighting to the interior and provide protection from direct light, while glowing from within after dark. \n \n \n \n  \n Interior of Beinecke Library . \n \n \n The sculptures in the sunken courtyard by Isamu Noguchi are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube). \n Alumnus Eero Saarinen , Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St.&#160;Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink at Yale and the newest residential colleges of Ezra Stiles and Morse. These latter were modelled after the medieval Italian hilltown of San Gimignano \xe2\x80\x93 a prototype chosen for the town\'s pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers. These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college\'s many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas. [ 77 ] \n Yale\'s Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale. [ 78 ] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by the year 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges. [ 79 ] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification. [ 80 ] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls. [ 81 ] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute\xe2\x80\x99s College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \xe2\x80\x9cB+\xe2\x80\x9d grade overall. [ 82 ] \n \n Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven \n Marsh Botanical Garden \n Yale Sustainable Food Project Farm \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n [ edit ] Notable nonresidential campus buildings \n Notable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel , Beinecke Rare Book Library , Harkness Tower , Ingalls Rink , Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories , Payne Whitney Gymnasium , Peabody Museum of Natural History , Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings , Sterling Memorial Library , Woolsey Hall , Yale Center for British Art , Yale University Art Gallery , and Yale Art &amp; Architecture Building . \n Yale\'s secret society buildings (some of which are called "tombs") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius , Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake , Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu , architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain , in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold ; Manuscript Society , King Lui-Wu with Dan Kniley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key , Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869\xe2\x80\x9370); Skull and Bones , possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo , (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison , 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor.

[ 84 ] \n In the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale\'s student and faculty recruiting efforts. [ 85 ] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven\'s crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven police and Yale\'s campus became the safest among the Ivy League and other peer schools. [ 86 ] Nonetheless, across the board, the city of New Haven has retained the highest levels of crime of any Ivy League city for more than a decade. [ 87 ] \n Between 2002 and 2004, Yale reported 14 violent crimes ( homicide , aggravated assault , or sex offenses ); in comparison, Harvard reported 83 such incidents, Princeton 24, and Stanford 54. The incidence of nonviolent crime ( burglary , arson , and motor vehicle theft ) was also lower than most of its peer schools. \n In 2004 a national non-profit watchdog group called Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S.&#160;Department of Education , accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults. [ 88 ]  [ 89 ] \n [ edit ] Academics \n [ edit ] Admissions \n \n \n \n  \nYale University\'s Sterling Memorial Library , as seen from Maya Lin\'s sculpture, Women\'s Table . The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969. \n \n \n For the Class of 2017, Yale accepted 1,991 students out of a record 29,610 total applications, hitting a record-low acceptance rate of 6.7%. [ 90 ] \n Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2016 was $41,320. Over 10% of students in Yale College are expected to have $0 parental contribution. [ 91 ] \n Half of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 30% are minorities , and 8% are international students . Fifty-five percent attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools. [ 92 ] In addition, Yale College admits a small group of non-traditional students each year, through the Eli Whitney Students Program . \n [ edit ] Collections \n \n \n \n  \n The Night Caf\xc3\xa9 , Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery . \n \n \n Yale University Library , which holds over 12 million volumes, is the second-largest university collection in the United States. [ 93 ] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library , contains about 4&#160;million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries. \n Rare books are found in a number of Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th\xe2\x80\x91century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club , technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale. \n Yale\'s museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery is the country\'s first university-affiliated art museum. It contains more than 180,000 works, including old masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn \'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art , the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building. \n The Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments , affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least well-known of Yale\'s collections, because its hours of opening are restricted. \n The museums also house the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 \xe2\x80\x93 when the removal of such artifacts was legal. Peru would now like to have the items returned; Yale has so far declined. [ 94 ] In November 2010, a Yale University representative agreed to return the artifacts to a Peruvian university.

[ 103 ] It was ranked fourth in the 2011 QS&#160;World University Rankings and tenth in the 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings . [ 104 ]  [ 105 ] Shanghai Jiao Tong University\xe2\x80\x99s Academic Ranking of World Universities , placed Yale at 11 in 2010. ARWU also ranked Yale 25th in Natural Sciences and Mathematics, 76\xe2\x80\x93100th in Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences, 9th in Life and Agriculture Sciences, 21st in Clinical Medicine and Pharmacy, and 8th in Social Sciences worldwide. [ 106 ] \n [ edit ] Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions \n The college is, after normalization for institution size, the tenth-largest baccalaureate source of doctoral degree recipients in the United States, and the largest such source within the Ivy League. [ 107 ] \n Yale\'s English and Comparative Literature departments were part of the New Criticism movement. Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren , W.K. Wimsatt , and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction . Jacques Derrida , the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called " Yale School ". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J.&#160;Hillis Miller , Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale\'s history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C.&#160;Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery , a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale\'s Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&#160;century. The Journal of Music Theory was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars. \n Since summer 2010, Yale has also been host to Yale Publishing Course . \n [ edit ] Campus life \n Yale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates , or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the 2010\xe2\x80\x932011 freshman class, 10% are non\xe2\x80\x91U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools. [ 108 ] Yale is also an open campus for the gay community . [ 109 ]  [ 110 ] Its active LGBT community first received wide publicity in the late 1980s, when Yale obtained a reputation as the "gay Ivy", due largely to a 1987 Wall Street Journal article written by Julie V. Iovine, an alumna and the spouse of a Yale faculty member. During the same year, the University hosted a national conference on gay and lesbian studies and established the Lesbian and Gay Studies Center. [ 111 ] The slogan "One in Four, Maybe More" was coined by the campus gay community. While the community in the 1980s and early 1990s was very activist, today most LGBT events have become part of the general campus social scene. [ 112 ] For example, the annual LGBT Co-op Dance attracts straight as well as gay students. \n [ edit ] Residential colleges \n Main article: Residential colleges of Yale University \n Yale has a system of 12 residential colleges , instituted in 1933 through a grant by Yale graduate Edward S. Harkness , who admired the college systems at Oxford and Cambridge. Each college has a Dean, Master, affiliated faculty, and resident Fellows. Each college also features distinctive architecture, secluded courtyards, a commons room, meeting rooms/classrooms, and a dining hall; in addition some have chapels, libraries, squash courts, pool tables, short order dining counters, cafes, or darkrooms. Each college at Yale offers its own seminars, social events, and Master\'s Teas, and most of them are open to students from other residential colleges. However, Yale remains a unitary university, while Oxford and Cambridge colleges are self-governed charitable institutions in their own right. \n All of Yale\'s 2,000 undergraduate courses are open to members of any college. \n The dominant architecture of the residential colleges is Neo-Gothic , in line with the characteristic architecture of the university. Several colleges have other period architecture, such as Georgian and Federal , and the two most recent ( Morse and Ezra Stiles ) have modernist concrete exteriors. \n Students are assigned to a residential college in their freshman year. Only two residential colleges ( Silliman and Timothy Dwight ) house freshmen. The majority of on-campus freshmen live on the " Old Campus ", an extensive quadrangle formed by older buildings. Each residential college has its own dining hall, but students are permitted to eat in any residential college dining hall or the large dining facility called "Commons". \n Residential colleges are named for important figures or places in university history or notable alumni. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Berkeley College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Branford College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Calhoun College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Davenport College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Jonathan Edwards College \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n Trumbull College \n \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] List of residential colleges \n This is a list of residential colleges at Yale. [ 113 ] \n \n Berkeley College , named for the Rt. Rev. George Berkeley (1685\xe2\x80\x931753), early benefactor of Yale. [ 114 ] \n Branford College , named for Branford, Connecticut , where Yale was briefly located. [ 115 ] \n Calhoun College , named for John C. Calhoun , vice-president and influential member of Congress of the United States. [ 116 ] \n Davenport College , named for Rev. John Davenport , the founder of New Haven. Often called "D\'port". [ 117 ] \n Ezra Stiles College , named for the Rev. Ezra Stiles , a president of Yale. Generally called "Stiles," despite an early-1990s crusade by then-master Traugott Lawler to preserve the use of the full name in everyday speech. Its buildings were designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 118 ] \n Jonathan Edwards College , named for theologian, Yale alumnus, and Princeton co-founder Jonathan Edwards . Generally called "J.E." The oldest of the residential colleges, J.E. is the only college with an independent endowment, the Jonathan Edwards Trust. [ 119 ] \n Morse College , named for Samuel F. B. Morse , inventor of Morse code and the telegraph . Also designed by Eero Saarinen . [ 120 ] \n Pierson College , named for Yale\'s first rector, Abraham Pierson . [ 121 ] A statue of Abraham Pierson stands on Yale\'s Old Campus. [ 122 ] \n Saybrook College , named for Old Saybrook, Connecticut , the town in which Yale was founded. [ 123 ] \n Silliman College , named for noted scientist and Yale professor Benjamin Silliman . About half of its structures were originally part of the Sheffield Scientific School . [ 124 ] \n Timothy Dwight College , named for the two Yale presidents of that name, Timothy Dwight IV and Timothy Dwight V . Often abbreviated "T.D." [ 125 ] \n Trumbull College , named for Jonathan Trumbull , first Governor of Connecticut. [ 126 ] \n \n \nIn 1998, Yale launched a series of extensive renovations to the older residential buildings, which in many decades of existence had seen only routine maintenance and incremental improvements to plumbing, heating, and electrical and network wiring. Many of these renovations have now been completed, and among other improvements, renovated colleges feature newly built basement facilities including snack bars called "butteries," game rooms, theaters, athletic facilities, fine arts studios, and music practice rooms. \n In June 2008, President Levin announced that the Yale Corporation had authorized the construction of two new residential colleges, scheduled to open in 2013. The additional colleges, to be built in the northern part of the campus, will allow for expanded admission and a reduction of crowding in the existing residential colleges. [ 127 ] Designs have been released, and some public controversy has surfaced over Yale\'s decision to demolish a number of historic buildings on the site, including a recently constructed library, in order to clear it for the $600&#160;million new structures. [ 128 ] \n [ edit ] Student organizations \n Main article: List of Yale University student organizations \n The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The latter categories include the Yale Daily News , which was first published in 1878, the weekly Yale Herald , published since 1986, and The Yale Record , which was established in 1872 and is America\'s oldest college humor magazine. Dwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition [ 129 ] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio [ 130 ] is the campus\'s radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM &amp; FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream. \n The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki . The Yale International Relations Association functions as the umbrella organization for the top-ranked Model UN team. \n The campus also includes several fraternities and sororities . The campus features at least 18 a&#160;cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs , who are unusual among college singing groups in being made up solely of senior men. \n Yale\'s secret societies include Skull and Bones , Scroll and Key , Wolf\'s Head , Book and Snake , Elihu , Berzelius , St.&#160;Elmo , Manuscript , and Mace and Chain . The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916). [ 131 ] \n The Elizabethan Club , a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the "Lizzie\'s" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, a first edition of Milton\'s Paradise Lost , among other important literary texts. \n [ edit ] Traditions \n Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their " bright college years ". [ 132 ] ("Bright College Years," the University\'s alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand , Class of 1881, to the tune of Die Wacht am Rhein .) Yale\'s student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus. Actual students rarely do so. [ 133 ] In the second half of the twentieth century Bladderball , a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009 and 2011, but its future remains uncertain. [ 134 ] \n [ edit ] Athletics \n \n \n \n  \nThe Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex. \n \n \n Main article: Yale Bulldogs \n Yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference , the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association . Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division&#160;I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships. \n Yale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation\'s first natural "bowl" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl ), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium , the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world. [ 135 ] October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale\'s fourth new boathouse in 157&#160;years of collegiate rowing. The Richard Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder&#160;\'79 and her father Richard Gilder&#160;\'54, who gave $4&#160;million towards the $7.5&#160;million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men\'s team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race . \n Yale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men\'s eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club , founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. \n In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school\'s ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game. [ 136 ] \n For kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played bladderball . [ 137 ] \n Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee , by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins. [ 138 ]  [ 139 ] \n [ edit ] Song \n Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement , convocation , alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, " Bright College Years ", and the Yale fight song , "Down the Field." \n Two other fight songs, "Bulldog, Bulldog" and "Bingo Eli Yale", written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days, are still sung at football games. Another fight song sung at games is " Boola Boola ". According to \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1998, \xe2\x80\x9cDown the Field\xe2\x80\x9d ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time. [ 140 ] \n [ edit ] Mascot \n The school mascot is " Handsome Dan ", the known Yale bulldog , and the Yale fight song (written by Cole Porter while he was a student at Yale) contains the refrain , "Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow." The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue . [ 141 ] Yale\'s Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889. [ 142 ] \n Yale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band . "Precision" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching. [ 143 ] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter. \n Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup. \n [ edit ] Notable people \n [ edit ] Benefactors \n Yale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale ; Jeremiah Dummer ; the Harkness family ( Edward , Anna , and William ); the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter); John William Sterling ; Payne Whitney ; Joseph E. Sheffield , Paul Mellon , Charles B.&#160;G. Murphy and William K. Lanman . The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder , donated $70&#160;million in commemoration of their 50th&#160;reunion. [ 144 ] \n [ edit ] Notable alumni and faculty \n Further information: List of Yale University people &#160;and&#160; List of Yale Law School alumni \n \n \n \n  \nAcademy Award Winning Actress Meryl Streep , Yale School of Drama class of 1975 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPresident William Howard Taft graduated from Yale in 1878. \n \n \n Yale has produced alumni distinguished in their respective fields.

For example, Owen Johnson \'s novel, Stover at Yale , follows the college career of Dink Stover [ 146 ] and Frank Merriwell , the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs. [ 147 ]  [ 148 ] Yale University was also mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald \'s novel " The Great Gatsby ". Nick Carraway and Tom Buchanan have both graduated from New Haven. The narrator (the former) has written a series of editorials for the Yale News and the following has been "one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven". \n [ edit ] Notes and references \n \n \n ^  As of June 30, 2012.

Identify records eligible for storage \n\tUse the General Records Schedule (GRS) or your office-specific records schedule to identify the types of records you have and how long you need to keep them. Records that are no longer used regularly by your office, but have not met their retention requirements are good candidates for off-site storage. \n 2. Order records storage boxes and barcodes \n\tOrder approved boxes and barcodes directly from Records Management Services by sending an email to archives_rms@harvard.edu . Boxes and barcodes will be delivered to your office within 2-3 business days. \n 3. Pack, label and barcode your boxes \n\tMake sure boxes are properly packed, labeled and barcoded. Refer to our Checklist for detailed packing and labeling instructions and tips. Please be aware that the Records Center couriers will refuse to pick up boxes that are not packed, labeled, and/or barcoded properly. \n 4. Complete Records Center Storage Deposit form \n\tFor each deposit, complete the Records Center Storage Deposit form . Instructions are included on the second page of the form. An example of a completed form can be found here . \n 5. Request deposit review and pick up \n\tSend the completed electronic form as an email attachment to archives_rms@harvard.edu . for review. Fax only the signature page (p.1) to 495-8011 when you are ready to transfer the boxes, or sign, scan, and send us the first page of the form via email in addition to the completed electronic form . RMS staff will review your paperwork and schedule a pick up. \n \xc2\xa0 \n For information on storage fees, please refer to the Records Center fee schedule . \n \xc2\xa0 \n \n\tRetrieving and Returning Records \n You may recall records to your office at any time. Next-day delivery is standard. For next day delivery, e-mail RMS before 3pm. Be sure an authorized user sends the e-mail. Include in your e-mail \n \n\t\tBarcodes of the boxes you need \n \n\t\tDelivery location \n \n\t\tAlternate contact at your office authorized to sign for the delivery \n If you will not be returning the boxes, please request that these barcodes be deleted.\xc2\xa0 Your office continues to pay for the space reserved for retrieved boxes, unless a deletion request is received. \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \xc2\xa0 \n  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\t \n\t \t \n\t \n \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Contact Us \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Library_Admin@Harvard.edu \n\t\t \n\t\t\t617-495-3650 \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Provide Feedback \n\t \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Search &amp; Find \n\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Research Support \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Research Tools \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Research Help \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Get It Services \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Contribute Your Research \n\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Libraries &amp; Archives \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Find a Library \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Archives &amp; Special Collections \n\t\t \n\t\t\t University Records Management \n\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t About Us \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Our Vision \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Our Community \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Service Directory \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Programs &amp; Initiatives \n\t\t \n\t\t\t News &amp; Events \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Giving to the Library \n\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Help \n\t\t \n\t\t\t General Information \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Tell Us \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Ask a Librarian \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Report a Problem \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Frequently Asked Questions \n\t\t\t \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \t\t \n\t \n \n  \n \t \n \t \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t  \n \n\t Harvard University \n\t Cambridge, MA 02138 \n\t 617.495.1000 | Feedback \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  Staff Login \n\n \n \n \t \n \n \n  \n \t \n \t \n \n  \n \n \n  \n\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Trademark Notice \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Report a Copyright Infringement \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Privacy Statement \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Accessibility \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Sitemap \n\t\t \n\t\t\t Harvard University \n\t \n\t Copyright 2013 The President and Fellows of Harvard College'

The game ended in a tie with a score of 29\xe2\x80\x9329. [ 1 ] It is the subject of the documentary Harvard Beats Yale 29-29 . [ 2 ] In 2010, ESPN ranked it #9 in its list of the top ten college football ties of all time. [ 3 ] \n The Harvard team made what is considered a miraculous last-moment comeback, scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie a highly touted Yale squad. [ 4 ] Yale came into the game with a 16-game winning streak and its quarterback, Brian Dowling , had only lost one game when he was in the starting lineup since the sixth grade. Both schools entered the game undefeated and untied with 8\xe2\x80\x930 records. [ 5 ] It was the first time both schools met when undefeated and untied since the 1909 season. [ 6 ] \n The tie left both teams 8\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 for the season, inspiring the Harvard Crimson student newspaper to print the headline "Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29". [ 7 ] This headline was later used as the title for a 2008 documentary about the game directed by Kevin Rafferty . [ 8 ] \n This game stands as the final tie in the series, as subsequent rule changes have eliminated ties from college football.

The phrase Big Three originated in the 1880s, when these three colleges dominated college football. [ 1 ] High schools\' college admissions counselors and colleges\' admissions guides sometimes use the initialism HYP to refer to these colleges. In the early 1900s, these schools formed a sports compact that predates the Ivy League . The schools continue to refer to their intercollegiate competitions as "Big Three" or "Harvard-Yale-Princeton" meets. These three universities are considered to be among the most prestigious colleges in America. \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Historic status of the Big Three \n 2 U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings \n 3 Economic diversity \n 4 Order of the names \n 5 The Big Three as an athletic association \n 6 See also \n 7 References \n 8 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Historic status of the Big Three \n These colleges have, in the past, been set apart from others by a special historic connection with the WASP establishment ; as E. Digby Baltzell writes, "The three major upper-class institutions in America have been Harvard, Yale, and Princeton." Baltzell also goes on to write that "Throughout the thirties and well into the forties, Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania were still staffed almost entirely by old-stock Protestants." [ 2 ] Of the three, Princeton University was traditionally the preferred choice of the Southern upper class. [ 3 ]  Theodore Roosevelt put the three schools into social context: \n \n We drew recruits from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and many another college; from clubs like the Somerset , of Boston, and Knickerbocker , of New York; and from among the men who belonged neither to club nor to college, but in whose veins the blood stirred with the same impulse which once sent the Vikings over sea. [ 4 ] \n \n The Saturday Review found in 1963 that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton enrolled 45% of boys on the New York Social Register . The University of Pennsylvania was fourth and the other Ivy League members had far fewer, below such schools as Trinity College and the University of Virginia . [ 5 ] That year Nathaniel Burt described the social prestige of the Big Three: \n \n It is, above all, the national social prestige of the Big Three which is competition with the purely local social prestige of the University [of Pennsylvania]. Upper-class boys from all over the country, including Philadelphia, go to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Only from Philadelphia do upper-class boys go in any significant numbers to Penn. This is of course a universal national phenomenon. The pattern of upper-class male college preference, as deduced from a counting of noses in the various Social Registers, can be summed up as "The Big Three and a Local Favorite." [ 6 ] \n \n Burt continued, "Every city sends or has sent its Socially Registered sons to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, in some preferred order, and to one local institution. This order varies. New York sets the pattern with Yale first, Harvard second, Princeton third, then Columbia. St. Louis and Baltimore are Princeton towns. Most other cities (Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati) are Yale towns. Only Boston, and occasionally Washington, are Harvard towns." \n The connection between certain colleges and social ranking is old; Jerome Karabel, in a note citing Kenneth Davis, says that "in the mid-eighteenth century, the [president of Harvard] personally listed students when they enrolled, according to ... \'to the Dignity of the Familie whereto the student severally belong\'\xe2\x80\x94a list that was printed in the college catalogue and that determined precedence in such matters as table seating, position in academic processionals, even recitations in class." [ 7 ] Ronald Story, however, says that it was during \xe2\x80\x9cthe four decades from 1815 to 1855\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cparents, in Henry Adams\xe2\x80\xb2 words, began sending their children to Harvard College for the sake of its social advantages.\xe2\x80\x9d [ 8 ] \n A further intensification of the importance of the Big Three occurred during the 1920s; According to E. Digby Baltzell, [ 9 ] \xe2\x80\x9cin a \xe2\x80\xa6 managerial society, the proper college degree became the main criterion for potential elite status\xe2\x80\xa6 it was during the [1920s] that certain institutions of high prestige, such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton (and Stanford on the West Coast) became all-important as upper-class-ascribing institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d Not coincidentally, this was also the era when the Big Three became concerned by \xe2\x80\x9cthe Jewish problem\xe2\x80\x9d and began instituting interviews, essays, and judgements of \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter\xe2\x80\x9d into the admissions process. [ 10 ] From the 1930s on, Big Three admissions became progressively more meritocratic, but still included non-academic factors such as \xe2\x80\x9clineage.\xe2\x80\x9d \n Harvard, Yale and Princeton have in the past been regarded as the goals for many children in WASP circles. Some educators have attempted to discourage this fixation. Jay Mathews, author of Harvard Schmarvard , addresses seniors obsessed with HYP, and similar prestigious institutions, with the analysis: \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not matter where you go to school, it matters what you do when you get there and what you do after you graduate.\xe2\x80\x9d \n [ edit ] U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings \n Main article: College and university rankings \n U.S. News &amp; World Report has consistently ranked Harvard, Yale, and Princeton as the top three institutions in the National Colleges and Universities category. [ 11 ] In their 2013 rankings, Harvard and Princeton were tied for first and Yale was ranked third. [ 11 ] \n [ edit ] Economic diversity \n Over the past half-century, the \'Big Three\', and the rest of the Ivy League, have increasingly stressed both diversity and academic merit in their admissions process, and in part have freed themselves from some of their WASP roots. Notwithstanding, a certain lack in economic diversity persists at the three colleges. As Jerome Karabel, a Harvard graduate and the author of The Chosen detailing the history of the admissions process at HYP, noted: \n \n \n \xe2\x80\x9c \n The Big Three are notoriously lacking one of [diversity\'s] most critical dimensions: class diversity. In a study of the percentage of low-income students in 2000 (as measured by the proportion of federal Pell Grants - need-based awards that do not have to be repaid and make up the bulk of many poorer students\' aid) at the nation\'s leading universities, the Big Three were found to be among the nation\'s least economically diverse schools. Of the 40 universities studied, Harvard and Princeton ranked 39th and 38th respectively, with Yale at 25th. While the three top universities in economic diversity were all public institutions (the University of California at Los Angeles , UC-Berkeley , and UC-San Diego ), the next two\xe2\x80\x94the University of Southern California and New York University \xe2\x80\x94were private. And one university in the top 10, California Institute of Technology , is among the most selective private institutions in the nation." [ 12 ] \n \xe2\x80\x9d \n \n \n More recently, Yale, [ 13 ] Princeton [ 14 ] and Harvard [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] instituted no-loan financial aid policies which provide students with need-based aid from private funds held by the universities. This enables greater attendance from the poorer classes than Pell Grant statistics would indicate, since many recipients of university grants do not receive Pell Grants. \n [ edit ] Order of the names \n The three colleges, when named together, are often named in the order Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. [ 17 ] This happens to be the order in which they were founded\xe2\x80\x941636, 1701, and 1746, respectively. [ 18 ] Founding date is an important point of institutional pride, since it governs the order in which the institutions march in academic processions . \n Harvard also has the largest student body, with Yale second, and Princeton third with its small graduate school. Harvard also has the largest endowment of the three, Yale the second largest, and Princeton the smallest; however, Princeton has the largest endowment per capita of any school in the world. \n [ edit ] The Big Three as an athletic association \n The athletic agreements among the three universities were first formalized in 1906, although their football teams had been engaging in three-way competitions, which newspapers had been referring to as "HYP", since at least the 1880s. The Big Three made further formal agreements in 1916 and 1923, and although in part they have now been superseded by the Ivy League , formed in 1945, the three universities still sponsor events that involve only themselves. \n The first Big Three agreement in 1906 was the result of a conference on football called by President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt in October 1905 as a result of deteriorating relations, particularly the exclusion of Princeton by Harvard and Yale, and increasing violence of play. The agreement of June 1916, the Triple Agreement, was originally proposed by President Woodrow Wilson in December 1909 out of a desire to reduce injuries, and took several years to come to fruition, resulting in common eligibility requirements. The Three Presidents\' Agreement agreement of January 1923 covered financial arrangements, scouting, and scholarships, amongst other things. In 1926 there was a disagreement between Harvard and Princeton, that caused a hiatus in the Big Three that lasted for eight years. \n [ edit ] See also \n \n Ivy League \n Little Ivies \n Little Three \n Oxbridge \n Seven Sisters \n SKY (universities) \n \n [ edit ] References \n \n \n ^  Synnott, Marsha G.

It was a center within Harvard University , United States. [ 1 ] \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 Foundation and leadership \n 2 Development programs \n 3 Research \n 4 Russian aid controversy \n 5 Dissolution \n 6 Selected publications \n 7 Notable alumni \n 8 References \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] Foundation and leadership \n The Harvard Institute for International Development originated when Harvard University \'s Center For International Affairs (CFIA) tried to move away from a controversial role in giving advice on topics such as arms control, foreign aid and development. The CFIA preferred a more academic role of teaching and research. The Ford Foundation and other organizations involved in aid-giving still wanted Harvard to provide hands-on training for their staff. In 1962 the Development Advisory Service was established for this purpose, associated with the CFIA but independent. It was renamed the HIID in 1974. [ 2 ] \n In 1980 the economist Arnold Harberger of the University of Harvard was selected as head of the institute. The announcement met with protests from students and staff since Harberger had previously advised the Augusto Pinochet military regime in Chile . He withdrew and Dwight Perkins , an economist and specialist in China, took the job. After the collapse of the Soviet Union , the economist Jeffrey Sachs became head of the institute. [ 2 ] \n [ edit ] Development programs \n The HIID became the umbrella organization for overseas aid and development programs led by the university but funded by the government or foundations. [ 2 ] The HIID coordinated development assistance, training, and research on Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America. The Institute helped developing nations to achieve economic growth and improve their people\'s welfare. [ 3 ] The institute provided staff for various development projects. For example, in the late 1970s David Korten headed a project funded by the Ford Foundation to assist in organization and management of national family-planning programs. [ 4 ] In 1991 the HIID launched a program called WorldTeach that sent college student and graduates to schools in developing countries for a one-year assignment. Countries that had requested volunteers were Costa Rica, Ecuador, Namibia, South Africa, Poland, Thailand and China. [ 5 ] \n [ edit ] Research \n \n \n \n  \nLittauer Building, John F. Kennedy School of Government, home of the HIID \n \n \n The HIID undertook many research projects related to international development. For example, in the erly 1980s the HIID undertook a study of several of Indonesia\'s national development programs, including grants for village development, schools, family planning and rice yield improvement programs. The programs had been running for some time, but the study uncovered a number of anomalies that were affecting their efficiency. [ 6 ] The HIID collaborated with the Women In Development office of USAID in developing the Harvard Analytical Framework , also called the Gender Roles Framework, one of the earliest frameworks for understanding differences between men and women in their participation in the economy. This has great importance in helping policy makers understand the economic case for allocating resources to women as well as men. The framework was described in 1984. [ 7 ]  [ 8 ] \n In 1987 the International Tropical Timber Organization commissioned HIID to prepare a review of current knowledge of multiple-use management of tropical hardwood forests. Of interest was the potential for non-timber products and services that could assist in sustaining the forests. HIID completed the study in 1988 and issued updated versions in 1990 and 1992. [ 9 ] Research published in 1989 described the effects of price controls in emerging economies in creating parallel or black markets. [ 10 ] As Ukraine started the transition towards a market economy in the early 1990s, the HIID supported a survey on barter in transition economies. [ 11 ] \n In 1993 the HIID managed an education sector assessment in El Salvador under contract from USAID, the purpose being to obtain reliable information for use in setting a national educational policy. [ 12 ] The HIID and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum jointly produced the 1997 Global Competitiveness Report based on a late-1996 survey of 2,827 firms in 53 countries. Among other questions, respondents were asked to say how often they saw evidence of corruption, and the answers were used to rank each country. [ 13 ] \n In mid-1998 the World Economic Forum and HIID assembled a team of experts to determine the causes of the Asian financial crisis and the mechanisms of the crisis, to determine methods of reducing the probability of similar crises in the future and to identify policy changes that would help the affected countries resume growth. [ 14 ] In the late 1990s USAID sponsored the Equity and Growth through Economic Research (EAGER) project, with the HIID commissioning work in eleven African countries. Both public strategies for growth and trade regimes for growth had both been intensively studied in the past, but resulting reforms had met little success. The focus of the EAGER research was to understand why programs had not been sustained, and what could be done to change that. [ 15 ] The above are just examples of the many research projects undertaken by the Institute. \n [ edit ] Russian aid controversy \n \n \n \n  \n Anatoly Borisovich Chubais , who worked closely with HIID advisers in Russia. \n \n \n With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded a project by the HIID to help rebuild the Russian economy on the basis of western concepts of ethics, democracy and free markets. [ 16 ]  Jeffrey Sachs was said to have "packaged HIID as an AID consultant". USAID were glad to accept help from Harvard, since they lacked expertise for such a project. [ 17 ] The HIID oversaw and guided disbursement of $300 million of US aid to Russia with little oversight by USAID. [ 18 ] HIID advisers worked closely with representatives from Russia, notably Anatoly Chubais and his associates. [ 19 ] Once USAID accepted help from the HIID, HIID was in a position to recommend U.S. aid policies while being a recipient of that aid. It also put the HIID in a position of power overseeing some of their competitors. [ 20 ] The project, which ran from 1992 to 1997, was headed by economist Andrei Shleifer and lawyer Jonathan Hay. [ 16 ] HIID received $40.4 million in return for its activities in Russia, awarded without the normal competitive bidding approach. [ 21 ] \n In 1996 the US Congress asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the HIID activities in the Russian aid program after multiple complaints to the congressional office had been made. The initial published GAO report considered the USAID\'s oversight over Harvard\'s Russia project "lax." The US government attempted to hold the Harvard players responsible for their clear conflicts of interest and undeniable misuse of government money but action was slow to ensue. [ 21 ] The original GAO report was critical, and further funding was withdrawn from HIID on the basis that as a contractor HIID has "abused the trust of the U.S. government by using personal relationships for private gain". [ 22 ] In September 2000 Shleifer and Hay were accused by the Justice Department of making personal investments in Russia, and therefore failing to act as impartial advisers. The episode became a factor in the dismissal of Larry Summers , who had set up the project as deputy secretary of the treasury under President Bill Clinton . [ 16 ] \n [ edit ] Dissolution \n The President of the institute from 1995, Jeffrey Sachs, resigned in 1999 to form the Center for International Development (CID), which would focus more on academic research than on consulting. [ 23 ] The CID was founded as a joint project of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the HIID. [ 24 ] A task force was appointed in July 1999 to review the future of the HIID, which in January 2000 concluded that it should be dissolved, with its functions distributed to faculties within the University. [ 3 ] Reasons included the Russian conflict of interest scandal, structural problems and financial deficits in 1998 and 1999. [ 23 ] In 2005, the university was required to pay the US government a settlement of $26.5 million for their involvement in the Russian development scandal. [ 25 ] The CID, housed at the Harvard Kennedy School , is now Harvard\'s primary center for research on international development. [ 26 ] \n [ edit ] Selected publications \n The institute began issuing a series of Development Discussion Papers soon after it began operation, and eventually published more than 700 papers by HIID staff members documenting their project experience and research results. Sub-series covered agriculture and food policy, education, taxation, economic reform and the environment. [ 27 ] The HIID also published some full-length books that covered broader topics.

Harvard is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States [ 7 ] and the first corporation (officially The President and Fellows of Harvard College ) chartered in the country. Harvard\'s history, influence, and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world. [ 8 ]  [ 9 ]  [ 10 ]  [ 11 ] \n Harvard was named after its first benefactor, John Harvard . Although never formally affiliated with a church, the college primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Harvard\'s curriculum and students became secular throughout the 18th century and by the 19th century had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites . [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] Following the American Civil War , President Charles W. Eliot \'s forty-year tenure (1869\xe2\x80\x931909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a centralized research university , and Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. [ 14 ]  James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College . Drew Gilpin Faust was elected the 28th president in 2007 and is the first woman to lead the university. Harvard has the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world, standing at $32 billion as of September 2011. [ 4 ] \n The university comprises eleven separate academic units\xe2\x80\x94ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study \xe2\x80\x94with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area. [ 15 ] Harvard\'s 210-acre (85&#160;ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3.4 miles (5.5&#160;km) northwest of downtown Boston . The business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium , are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical , dental , and public health schools are located in the Longwood Medical Area . [ 6 ] \n Eight U.S. presidents have been graduates, and 75 Nobel Laureates have been student, faculty, or staff affiliates. Harvard is also the alma mater of sixty-two living billionaires , the most in the country. [ 16 ] The Harvard University Library is the largest academic library in the United States, and one of the largest in the world. [ 17 ] \n The Harvard Crimson competes in 41 intercollegiate sports in the NCAA Division I Ivy League . Harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with Yale University traditionally culminating in The Game , although the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale Regatta predates the football game. This rivalry, though, is put aside every two years when the Harvard and Yale Track and Field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford University and Cambridge University team, a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.

Initially called "New College" or "the college at New Towne", the institution was renamed Harvard College on March 13, 1639. It was named after John Harvard , a young English clergyman from Southwark , London , an alumnus of the University of Cambridge (after which Cambridge, Massachusetts is named), who bequeathed the College his library of four hundred books and \xc2\xa3 779 pounds sterling , which was half of his estate. [ 19 ] The charter creating the corporation of Harvard College came in 1650. In the early years, the College trained many Puritan ministers. [ 20 ] The college offered a classic academic course based on the English university model\xe2\x80\x94many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge \xe2\x80\x94but one consistent with the prevailing Puritan philosophy. The college was never affiliated with any particular denomination, but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in Congregational and Unitarian churches throughout New England. [ 21 ] An early brochure, published in 1643, described the founding of the college as a response to the desire "to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches". [ 22 ] \n The leading Boston divine Increase Mather served as president from 1685 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman, which marked a turning of the college toward intellectual independence from Puritanism. \n 19th century \n \n \n \n  \n John Harvard statue , Harvard Yard \n \n \n Religion and philosophy \n The takeover of Harvard by the Unitarians in 1805 resulted in the secularization of the American college. By 1850 Harvard was the "Unitarian Vatican". The "liberals" (Unitarians) allied themselves with high Federalists and began to create a set of private societies and institutions meant to shore up their cultural and political authority, a movement that prefigured the emergence of the Boston Brahmin class. On the other hand, the theological conservatives used print media to argue for the maintenance of open debate and democratic governance through a diverse public sphere, seeing the liberals\' movement as an attempt to create a cultural oligarchy in opposition to Congregationalist tradition and republican political principles. [ 23 ] \n In 1846, the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College. Agassiz\'s approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans\' "participation in the Divine Nature" and the possibility of understanding "intellectual existences".\' Agassiz\'s perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the "divine plan" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz\'s efforts to "soar with Plato" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge . The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the "official philosophy" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school. [ 24 ] \n Charles W. Eliot , president 1869\xe2\x80\x931909, eliminated the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. While Eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education, but by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions. Derived from William Ellery Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature, the right and ability of each person to perceive truth, and the indwelling God in each person. [ 25 ] \n 20th century \n \n \n \n  \nRichard Rummell\'s 1906 watercolor landscape view, facing northeast. [ 26 ] \n \n \n During the 20th century, Harvard\'s international reputation grew as a burgeoning endowment and prominent professors expanded the university\'s scope. Explosive growth in the student population continued with the addition of new graduate schools and the expansion of the undergraduate program. Radcliffe College , established in 1879 as sister school of Harvard College, became one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. \n Meritocracy \n James Bryant Conant (president, 1933\xe2\x80\x931953) reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions. He saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy, so Conant devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. In 1943, he asked the faculty make a definitive statement about what general education ought to be, at the secondary as well as the college level. The resulting Report , published in 1945, was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of American education in the 20th century. [ 27 ] \n In 1945\xe2\x80\x931960 admissions policies were opened up to bring in students from a more diverse applicant pool. No longer drawing mostly from rich alumni of select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college was now open to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but few blacks, Hispanics or Asians. [ 28 ] \n Women \n Women remained segregated at Radcliffe, though more and more took Harvard classes. Nonetheless, Harvard\'s undergraduate population remained predominantly male, with about four men attending Harvard College for every woman studying at Radcliffe. Following the merger of Harvard and Radcliffe admissions in 1977, the proportion of female undergraduates steadily increased, mirroring a trend throughout higher education in the United States. Harvard\'s graduate schools, which had accepted females and other groups in greater numbers even before the college, also became more diverse in the post-World War II period. \n In 1999, Radcliffe College , founded in 1879 as the "Harvard Annex for Women", [ 29 ] merged formally with Harvard University, becoming the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study . \n Drew Gilpin Faust , the Dean at Radcliffe, became the first woman president of Harvard in 2007. \n \n \n \n  \n Harvard Yard as seen from the Holyoke Center \n \n \n Liberalism \n Harvard and its affiliates, like many American universities, [ 30 ]  [ 31 ] are considered by some to be politically liberal (left of center). [ 32 ]  Conservative author William F. Buckley, Jr. quipped that he would rather be governed by the first 2000 names in the Boston phone book than by the Harvard faculty, [ 33 ] President Richard Nixon famously referred to Harvard as the " Kremlin on the Charles " around 1970, [ 34 ] and Vice President George H.W. Bush disparaged what he saw to be Harvard\'s liberalism during the 1988 presidential election . [ 35 ] \n Recent history \n President Lawrence Summers resigned his presidency in 2006. His resignation came one week before a second planned vote of no confidence by the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Former president Derek Bok served as interim president. Members of Harvard\'s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which instructs graduate students in GSAS and undergraduates in Harvard College, had passed an earlier motion of "lack of confidence" in Summers\' leadership on March 15, 2005 by a 218\xe2\x80\x93185 vote, with 18 abstentions. The 2005 motion was precipitated by comments about the causes of gender demographics in academia made at a closed academic conference and leaked to the press. [ 36 ] In response, Summers convened two committees to study this issue: the Task Force on Women Faculty and the Task Force on Women in Science and Engineering. Summers had also pledged $50 million to support their recommendations and other proposed reforms. Drew Gilpin Faust is the 28th president of Harvard. An American historian , former dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study , and Lincoln Professor of History at Harvard University, Faust is the first female president in the university\'s history.

There is also the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study . \n Harvard is governed by a combination [ clarification needed ] of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University . There are 16,000 staff and faculty. [ 39 ] \n A faculty of approximately 2,410 professors, lecturers, and instructors serve as of school year 2009\xe2\x80\x9310, [ 40 ] with 7,180 undergraduate and 13,830 graduate students. [ 41 ] The school color is crimson , which is also the name of the Harvard sports teams and the daily newspaper, The Harvard Crimson . The color was unofficially adopted (in preference to magenta ) by an 1875 vote of the student body, although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858, when Charles William Eliot , a young graduate student who would later become Harvard\'s 21st and longest-serving president (1869\xe2\x80\x931909), bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta. \n Joint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology , the Broad Institute , The Observatory of Economic Complexity , and edX . \n \n \n \n  \nHarvard Yard in the winter, with freshman dorms in the background \n \n \n Endowment \n Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011, it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth $32 billion in 2011, up from $27.6 billion in September 2010 [ 42 ] and $25.7 billion 2009. It suffered about 30% loss in 2008-2009. [ 4 ]  [ 43 ] In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. [ 44 ] Later reports [ 45 ] suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. [ 46 ] One of the most visible results of Harvard\'s attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting [ 45 ] of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. [ 47 ] As of 2012, Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of $158.725 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of $4.093 million available for disbursement. [ 48 ] \n Campus \n Harvard\'s 210-acre (85&#160;ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3.4 miles (5.5&#160;km) northwest of downtown Boston and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. Harvard Yard itself contains the central administrative offices and main libraries of the university , academic buildings including Sever Hall and University Hall , Memorial Church, and the majority of the freshman dormitories . Sophomore, junior, and senior undergraduates live in twelve residential Houses , nine of which are south of Harvard Yard along or near the Charles River . The other three are located in a residential neighborhood half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Quadrangle (commonly referred to as the Quad), which formerly housed Radcliffe College students until Radcliffe merged its residential system with Harvard. The Harvard MBTA station provides public transportation via bus service and the Red Line subway . \n \n \n \n  \n Memorial Hall \n \n \n The Harvard Business School and many of the university\'s athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium , are located on a 359-acre (145&#160;ha) campus opposite the Cambridge campus in Allston . The John W. Weeks Bridge is a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River connecting both campuses. The Harvard Medical School , Harvard School of Dental Medicine , and the Harvard School of Public Health are located on a 22-acre (8.9&#160;ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area approximately 3.3 miles (5.3&#160;km) southwest of downtown Boston and 3.3 miles (5.3&#160;km) south of the Cambridge campus. [ 6 ] A private shuttle bus connects the Longwood campus to the Cambridge campus via Massachusetts Avenue making stops in the Back Bay and at MIT as well. [ 49 ] \n Each residential house contains rooms for undergraduates, House masters, and resident tutors, as well as a dining hall, library, and various other student facilities. The facilities were made possible by a gift from Yale University alumnus Edward Harkness . [ 50 ] \n \n \n \n  \nMemorial Church in the winter \n \n \n Radcliffe Yard, formerly the center of the campus of Radcliffe College (and now home of the Radcliffe Institute), is adjacent to the Graduate School of Education and the Cambridge Common . \n From 2009\xe2\x80\x932011, Harvard University reported on-campus crime statistics that included 69 forcible sex offenses, 12 robberies, 15 aggravated assaults, 80 burglaries, and 10 cases of motor vehicle theft. [ 51 ] \n Satellite facilities \n Apart from its major Cambridge/Allston and Longwood campuses, Harvard owns and operates Arnold Arboretum , in the Jamaica Plain area of Boston; the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection , in Washington, D.C. ; the Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts ; and the Villa I Tatti research center [ 52 ] in Florence . Harvard also operates the Harvard Shanghai Center in China. \n Major campus expansion \n Throughout the past several years, Harvard has purchased large tracts of land in Allston , a walk across the Charles River from Cambridge, with the intent of major expansion southward. [ 53 ] The university now owns approximately fifty percent more land in Allston than in Cambridge. Various proposals to connect the traditional Cambridge campus with the new Allston campus include new and enlarged bridges, a shuttle service and/or a tram . Ambitious plans also call for sinking part of Storrow Drive (at Harvard\'s expense) for replacement with park land and pedestrian access to the Charles River , as well as the construction of bike paths, and an intently planned fabric of buildings throughout the Allston campus. The institution asserts that such expansion will benefit not only the school, but surrounding community, pointing to such features as the enhanced transit infrastructure, possible shuttles open to the public, and park space which will also be publicly accessible. \n One of the foremost driving forces for Harvard\'s pending expansion is its goal of substantially increasing the scope and strength of its science and technology programs. The university plans to construct two 500,000 square foot (50,000 m\xc2\xb2) research complexes in Allston, which would be home to several interdisciplinary programs, including the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and an enlarged Engineering department. \n In addition, Harvard intends to relocate the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard School of Public Health to Allston. The university also plans to construct several new undergraduate and graduate student housing centers in Allston, and it is considering large-scale museums and performing arts complexes as well. Unfortunately the large drop in endowment has halted these plans for now. \n Sustainability \n In 2000, Harvard hired a full-time campus sustainability professional and launched the Harvard Green Campus Initiative, [ 54 ] since institutionalized as the Office for Sustainability (OFS). [ 55 ] \n With a full-time staff of 25, dozens of student interns, and a $12 million Loan Fund for energy and water conservation projects, OFS is one of the most advanced campus sustainability programs in the country. [ 56 ] Harvard was one of 27 schools to receive a grade of "A-" from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2010, the highest grade awarded. [ 57 ] \n Academics \n \n \n \n  \n Massachusetts Hall (1720) is the oldest building in the Harvard campus. [ 58 ] \n \n \n Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. [ 59 ] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929. [ 60 ] The university offers 46 undergraduate concentrations (majors), [ 61 ] 134 graduate degrees, [ 62 ] and 32 professional degrees. [ 63 ] For the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 academic year, Harvard granted 1,664 baccalaureate degrees, 400 masters degrees, 512 doctoral degrees, and 4,460 professional degrees. [ 63 ] \n The four year, full-time undergraduate program comprises a minority of enrollments at the university and emphasizes instruction with an "arts &amp; sciences focus". [ 59 ] Between 1978 and 2008, entering students were required to complete a "Core Curriculum" of seven classes outside of their concentration. [ 64 ] Since 2008, undergraduate students have been required to complete courses in eight General Education categories: Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Ethical Reasoning, Science of Living Systems, Science of the Physical Universe, Societies of the World, and United States in the World. [ 65 ] Harvard offers a comprehensive doctoral graduate program and there is a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate degrees. [ 59 ]  The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , The New York Times , and some students have criticized Harvard for its reliance on teaching fellows for some aspects of undergraduate education; they consider this to adversely affect the quality of education. [ 66 ]  [ 67 ] \n Harvard\'s academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early September and ending in mid-May. [ 68 ] Undergraduates typically take four half-courses per term and must maintain a four-course rate average to be considered full-time. [ 69 ] In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced course work. [ 70 ] Students graduating in the top 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude , students in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum laude , and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude . [ 71 ] Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa and various committees and departments also award several hundred named prizes annually. [ 72 ] Harvard, along with other universities, has been accused of grade inflation , [ 73 ] although there is evidence that the quality of the student body and its motivation have also increased. [ 74 ] Harvard College reduced the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% in 2004 to 60% in 2005. Moreover, the honors of "John Harvard Scholar" and "Harvard College Scholar" will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class. [ 75 ]  [ 76 ]  [ 77 ]  [ 78 ] \n Undergraduate tuition for the 2009\xe2\x80\x932010 school year was $33,696 and the total cost with fees, room, and board was $48,868. [ 79 ] Under financial aid guidelines adopted in 2007, parents in families with incomes of less than $60,000 will no longer be expected to contribute any money to the cost of attending Harvard for their children, including room and board. Families with incomes in the $60,000 to $80,000 range contribute an amount of only a few thousand dollars a year. In December 2007, Harvard announced that families earning between $120,000 and $180,000 will only have to pay up to 10% of their annual household income towards tuition. [ 80 ] In 2009, Harvard offered grants totaling $414.1 million across all 11 divisions; $339.5 million came from institutional funds, $35.3 million from federal support, and $39.2 million from other outside support. Grants total 87.7% of Harvard\'s aid for undergraduate students, with aid also provided by loans (8.4%) and work-study (3.9%).

[ 17 ] \n Cabot Science Library, Lamont Library, and Widener Library are three of the most popular libraries for undergraduates to use, with easy access and central locations. There are rare books, manuscripts and other special collections throughout Harvard\'s libraries; [ 105 ] Houghton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America\'s oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public.

Harvard enrolled 6,655 students in undergraduate programs, 3,738 students in graduate programs, and 10,722 students in professional programs. [ 106 ] The undergraduate population is 51% female, the graduate population is 48% female, and the professional population is 49% female. [ 106 ] \n Undergraduate admission to Harvard is characterized by the Carnegie Foundation as "more selective, lower transfer-in". [ 59 ] Harvard College received 27,462 applications for admission to the Class of 2013, 2,175 were admitted (7.9%), and 1,658 enrolled (76.2%). [ 108 ] 95% of first year students graduated in the top tenth of their high school class. [ 108 ] Harvard also enrolled 266 National Merit Scholars , the most in the nation. [ 109 ] 88% of students graduate within 4 years and 98% graduate within 6 years. [ 110 ] \n Harvard College accepted 5.8% of applicants for the class of 2017, a record low for the school\'s entire history. [ 111 ] The number of acceptances has gone down since the university announced a large increase in financial aid in 2008. [ citation needed ] Harvard College ended its early admissions program in 2007 as the program was believed to disadvantage low-income and under-represented minority applicants applying to selective universities. [ 112 ] For the Class of 2016 an Early Action program was reintroduced. The undergraduate admissions office\'s preference for children of alumni policies have been the subject of scrutiny and debate as it primarily aids whites and the wealthy and seems to conflict with the concept of meritocratic admissions.

While Harvard\'s football team is no longer one of the country\'s best as it often was a century ago during football\'s early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is played. In 1903, Harvard Stadium introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium\'s structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, the Father of Football, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game. But the state-of-the-art Harvard Stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass , perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport\'s history. [ 115 ]  [ 116 ] \n Harvard has several athletic facilities, such as the Lavietes Pavilion , a multi-purpose arena and home to the Harvard basketball teams. The Malkin Athletic Center, known as the "MAC", serves both as the university\'s primary recreation facility and as a satellite location for several varsity sports. The five story building includes two cardio rooms, an Olympic-size swimming pool , a smaller pool for aquaerobics and other activities, a mezzanine, where all types of classes are held at all hours of the day, and an indoor cycling studio, three weight rooms, and a three-court gym floor to play basketball. The MAC also offers personal trainers and specialty classes. The MAC is also home to Harvard volleyball, fencing, and wrestling. The offices of several of the school\'s varsity coaches are also in the MAC. \n Weld Boathouse and Newell Boathouse house the women\'s and men\'s rowing teams, respectively. The men\'s crew also uses the Red Top complex in Ledyard, Connecticut, as their training camp for the annual Harvard-Yale Regatta . The Bright Hockey Center hosts the Harvard hockey teams, and the Murr Center serves both as a home for Harvard\'s squash and tennis teams as well as a strength and conditioning center for all athletic sports. \n As of 2006, there were 41 Division I intercollegiate varsity sports teams for women and men at Harvard, more than at any other NCAA Division I college in the country. As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships . [ 117 ] \n Older than The Game by 23 years, the Harvard-Yale Regatta was the original source of the athletic rivalry between the two schools. It is held annually in June on the Thames River in eastern Connecticut. The Harvard crew is typically considered to be one of the top teams in the country in rowing . Today, Harvard fields top teams in several other sports, such as the Harvard Crimson men\'s ice hockey team (with a strong rivalry against Cornell ), squash , and even recently won NCAA titles in Men\'s and Women\'s Fencing . Harvard also won the Intercollegiate Sailing Association National Championships in 2003. \n Harvard\'s men\'s ice hockey team won the school\'s first NCAA Championship in any team sport in 1989. Harvard was also the first Ivy League institution to win a NCAA championship title in a women\'s sport when its women\'s lacrosse team won the NCAA Championship in 1990. \n Harvard Undergraduate Television has footage from historical games and athletic events including the 2005 pep-rally before the Harvard-Yale Game. Harvard\'s official athletics website has more comprehensive information about Harvard\'s athletic facilities. \n Song \n Harvard has several fight songs, the most played of which, especially at football, are " Ten Thousand Men of Harvard " and " Harvardiana ." While " Fair Harvard " is actually the alma mater , "Ten Thousand Men" is better known outside the university. The Harvard University Band performs these fight songs, and other cheers, at football and hockey games.

(March 2013)  \n \n \n The perception of Harvard as a center of either elite achievement, or elitist privilege, has made it a frequent literary backdrop. \n In literature \n \n The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich is a narrative account of Facebook\'s founding set partially at Harvard \n Hacking Harvard is novel by Robin Wasserman , a Harvard University alumna. \n In The Handmaid\'s Tale , Margaret Atwood \'s post-apocalyptic novel, much of the action takes place in Cambridge, with vaguely recognizable Harvard landmarks occasionally making their way into the narrator\'s place descriptions. \n Erich Segal \'s Love Story (1970), which concerns a romance between a wealthy hockey player ( Ryan O\'Neal ) and a brilliant Radcliffe student of modest means ( Ali MacGraw ), [ 119 ] is screened annually for incoming freshmen. [ citation needed ] Segal\'s The Class (1985) and Doctors (1988) are also set at Harvard. \n The Paper Chase by John Jay Osborn, Jr. , a 1970 novel adapted for a film and a television series based at Harvard Law School. \n The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane , a 2009 bestselling novel by Katherine Howe , prominently features the university and several of its buildings . \n The Second Happiest Day (1953) by "John Phillips" (John P. Marquand, Jr.) depicts the Harvard of the World War II generation. \n The Sound and the Fury , by William Faulkner , features Quentin Compson\'s experiences at Harvard. \n The Women\'s Room , by Marilyn French , largely features protagonist Mira\'s experiences at Harvard \n Pamela Thomas-Graham \'s series of mystery novels ( Blue Blood , Orange Crushed , and A Darker Shade Of Crimson ), protagonist Nikki Chase is an African-American Harvard economics professor. \n Cecilia Tan \'s romance novel series, commonly known as the "Magic University series" and including the books The Siren and the Sword and The Tower and the Tears , is set at the magical university hidden inside Harvard known as "Veritas". \n \n Onscreen \n Because Harvard generally forbids filming on its property, most scenes set at Harvard (especially indoor shots, but excepting aerial footage and shots of public areas such as Harvard Square) are in fact shot elsewhere.

Since 1692 University seals have borne Christo et Ecclesiae (for Christ and the Church) in this manner, arguably making that phrase the University\'s motto in a heraldic sense. This legend is otherwise not in general use today. \n ^  An appropriation of \xc2\xa3400 toward a "school or college" was voted on October 28, 1636 (OS), at a meeting which initially convened on September 8 and was adjourned to October 28. Some sources consider October 28, 1636 (OS) (November 7, 1636 NS) to be the date of founding. Harvard\'s 1936 tercentenary celebration treated September 18 as the founding date, though 1836 bicentennial was celebrated on September 8, 1836. Sources: meeting dates, Quincy, Josiah (1860).

The case was reviewed by the administrative board, which concluded in December. Like Us on Facebook    \r\n Generally, the suspension period in the university extends up to two or four terms during which students\' tuition payments would be refunded. \r\n Staples founder Thomas Stemberg, a Harvard graduate whose son also studies in the university, told the newspaper that the professor who taught the course changed the rules after several exams in which \'open collaboration\' was encouraged. \r\n Even though this exam was an \'open collaboration\' test, discussing with professors, teaching fellows "and others was prohibited. \r\n "If the message was so clearly expressed, why did some of the teaching fellows go over the exam in open session ... If they did not get the message, could one expect the students to understand it?" Stemberg said. \r\n Once the scandal broke out, implicated students alleged that course\'s rules on collaboration were unclear, Bloomberg reported . \r\n Athletics caught in the cheating investigation also faced some harsh punishments. Two basketball teams\' co-captains were removed from the team. Other athletes involved include members from basketball, football, baseball and hockey teams. \r\n Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith told the Huffington Post that the school committee was working on strengthening a culture of academic honesty and promoting ethics in scholarship. \r\n "This is a time for communal reflection and action. We are responsible for creating the community in which our students study and we all thrive as scholars," Smith said. \r\n Harvard undergraduate council president Tara Raghuveer told the newspaper that there were a lot of questions about whether the take-home exam\'s instructions were clear enough when it came to group work exams or assignments. \r\n Every year, about 17 students are forced to leave the University for Academic Dishonesty. \t\t  \r\n  \n\n\n \n\t \n\t\t \n\t  \n\t   \n\t   \n\t   You have already subscribed.

[ 2 ] HUTV shows include Ivory Tower , On Harvard Time (an award-winning comedy news show [ 3 ] ), and video reports by The Harvard Crimson (Harvard\'s daily student newspaper). [ 4 ] The network has a full production studio and post-production editing facilities in Pforzheimer House , a Harvard dormitory. [ 5 ] \n HUTV, under the guidance of co-President Derek Flanzraich, replaced then-defunct Harvard-Radcliffe Television (HRTV) on April 6, 2009, [ 6 ] inheriting HRTV\'s shows and staff. [ 5 ] The predecessor to HRTV, the Harvard-Radcliffe Film Workshop, was founded in 1975 by Bob Doyle , [ 7 ] the inventor known for developing a method of syncing sound on Super 8 mm film and for creating the first desktop publishing software , MacPublisher . \n \n \n \n \n Contents \n \n \n 1 History \n \n 1.1 Harvard-Radcliffe Film Workshop (HRFW) \n 1.2 Harvard-Radcliffe Television (HRTV) \n 1.3 Harvard Undergraduate Television (HUTV) \n \n \n 2 Current Shows \n \n 2.1 HUTV Productions \n 2.2 Content Partners \n \n \n 3 References \n 4 External links \n \n \n \n \n [ edit ] History \n [ edit ] Harvard-Radcliffe Film Workshop (HRFW) \n In 1975, Bob Doyle , who was then working as a research fellow in Harvard\'s Department of Visual and Environmental Studies , founded the Harvard-Radcliffe Film Workshop (HRFW), which offered filmmaking instruction and film screenings in the Morse Music Library in the basement of Pforzheimer House , which was then known as North House. [ 8 ] \n In the 1980s, Doyle helped form the Desktop Video Group to "support undergraduate video production and television distribution" at Brown and Harvard Universities. [ 9 ] \n [ edit ] Harvard-Radcliffe Television (HRTV) \n \n \n \n  \nThe HRTV logo \n \n \n In 1992, Emily Brodsky founded Harvard-Radcliffe Television (HRTV). [ 8 ] That same year, Ivory Tower , the Ivy League\'s oldest soap opera , became one of HRTV\'s first shows. [ 10 ] \n Until 1996, HRTV\'s shows were edited using Desktop Video Group equipment. In 1996, the Morse Music Library, which had previously been the site of HRFW\'s instruction sessions and film screenings, was re-organized into a television studio for HRTV, overseen by Doyle and aided financially by Pforzheimer House . [ 8 ] \n In its early years, HRTV screened its shows in dormitory common rooms and dining halls, [ 8 ] as well as on various Cambridge Public-access television cable TV channels. [ 11 ]  [ 12 ]  [ 13 ] In 2006, HRTV began posting all of its shows exclusively online, though episodes of Ivory Tower had been posted online before then. [ 14 ] \n Several prominent Harvard alumni in the film and television industries have been members of the HRTV Honorary Board of Advisers, including Matt Damon , Conan O\'Brien , Mira Sorvino , Jack Lemmon , Elisabeth Shue , and John Lithgow . [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Harvard Undergraduate Television (HUTV) \n On April 6, 2009, HRTV relaunched as Harvard Undergraduate Television, under the direction of co-president Derek Flanzraich. [ 5 ] The transformation included a new website and a short promotional video featuring Harvard professor and prominent psychologist Steven Pinker smashing a television and telling viewers to "get with the times" by watching television online. [ 15 ] \n [ edit ] Current Shows \n [ edit ] HUTV Productions \n HUTV currently produces eight shows. [ 16 ] \n \n Ivory Tower - Created in 1992 by Sara Alexandra Bibel and Andrea N. Moore, Ivory Tower is HUTV\'s longest-running show and the Ivy League\'s oldest soap opera , and according to the show\'s staff the oldest college soap opera. In fall 2008, Ivory Tower switched from a soap opera format to a situation comedy format. It has been popular not only on the Harvard campus but also, since being posted online, in South Korea . [ 10 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 17 ]  [ 18 ] \n \n \n Respectably French! - A sketch comedy show created by Nicholas Krasney, Ho Tuan, and Matthew Tai, Respectably French! is currently in its fifth season. In addition to popular sketch comedy programming, the show has interviewed and been endorsed by celebrities such as Kevin Nealon of Saturday Night Live , Eric Idle of Monty Python , Homestar Runner , and Pleasureman Gunther . [ 19 ]  [ 20 ] In 2008, Respectably French! has also covered ROFLCon and the 2008 Republican National Convention . \n \n \n On Harvard Time - HUTV\'s satirical news show, modeled after The Daily Show , presents and comments on news at Harvard in a comedic fashion. Currently in its fourth season, On Harvard Time produces weekly episodes as well as periodic humorous interviews with both Harvard and national public figures, such as Harvard Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove , and 2008 U.S. Presidential candidate Mike Gravel . On Harvard Time\'s November 2008 "Harvard Yale Aid" video , mocking Yale University before the annual Harvard-Yale football game , was named 2008 Ivy League Video of the Year by IvyGate Blog . [ 3 ]  [ 21 ]  [ 22 ] Founded and created by Derek Flanzraich in 2006, today it is "HUTV\'s most popular show." [ 23 ] \n \n \n Crimson Edition - A long-form news documentary show, Crimson Edition made its debut in 1995. It was relaunched with a more serious focus in 2006 by Executive Producer Eric Paternot, and is inspired by television news magazines such as 60 Minutes . Past topics have included Harvard\'s African-American community and the situation of the homeless in Harvard Square . [ 8 ]  [ 24 ]  [ 25 ] \n \n \n HUTV News - Founded in 2007, HUTV News is HUTV\'s short-form news show, producing shorter reports than Crimson Edition on a wider range of topics. Before HRTV became HUTV, HUTV News was called HRTV News . [ 26 ]  [ 27 ] \n \n \n Harvard Hooligans - This comedic show follows a group of college roommates. Most Harvard Hooligans episodes depict them speaking into a webcam and portraying a stereotypically nerdy students commenting on Harvard events. However, members have also interviewed comedian Will Ferrell , covered the 2008 Democratic National Convention , and run for president of the Harvard student body over the course of the show. [ 28 ]  [ 29 ] \n \n \n Love@Harvard - Modeled after The Dating Game , Love@Harvard is a show in which three students compete to win a date with another student contestant. It debuted in November 2008. [ 30 ] \n \n \n H-Biz Tonight - Formerly HBS TV Market Minute with Mia Saini , H-Biz Tonight features short daily reports from Harvard Business School student Mia Saini on economic news. [ 31 ]  [ 32 ] \n \n [ edit ] Content Partners \n HUTV also currently features three "content partners" on its site. [ 16 ] These shows are not produced by HUTV staff, but according to HUTV\'s website "HUTV distributes their content as part of [their] mission to connect media groups on the Harvard campus." [ 33 ] \n \n The Harvard Crimson Video - Video reports from The Harvard Crimson , Harvard University\'s daily student newspaper . The Crimson began producing videos in March 2009 as part of its "Project Sorrento" , an effort to modernize the paper\'s website through the use of multimedia . [ 34 ] \n \n \n UCTV - Biweekly addresses from the President of the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC), Harvard\'s student government , to the Harvard student body , modeled on the weekly United States presidential address . [ 35 ]  [ 36 ] \n \n \n The Yard - An improvised "docu-soap" about six Harvard undergraduates, premiered in 2009 and produced jointly by students at Harvard and Emerson College .

In 1639 it was renamed in honor of deceased Charlestown minister John Harvard , who had bequeathed to the school his entire library and half of his monetary estate. \n Harvard\'s first instructor, schoolmaster Nathaniel Eaton , was also its first instructor to be dismissed\xe2\x80\x94in 1639 for overstrict discipline. [ 4 ] The school\'s first students were graduated in 1642. In 1665, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck , "from the Wampanoag ... did graduate from Harvard, the first Indian to do so in the colonial period." [ 5 ] \n \n \n \n  \nLt Gov William Stoughton circa 1700 overlooking one of the buildings of Harvard College \n \n \n At the time of Harvard\'s founding (as today) the colleges of England\'s Oxford and Cambridge were communities within the larger university, each an association of scholars (both established and aspiring) sharing room and board; Harvard\'s founders may have envisioned it as the first in a series of sibling colleges which, on the English model, would eventually constitute a university. Though no further "colleges" materialized, nonetheless as Harvard began granting higher degrees in the late eighteenth century it was increasingly styled Harvard University \xe2\x80\x94even as Harvard College (in keeping with emerging American usage of that word) was increasingly thought of as the university\'s undergraduate division in particular. [ citations needed throughout ] \n Today Harvard College is responsible for undergraduate admissions, advising, housing, student life, and athletics \xe2\x80\x93 generally all undergraduate matters except instruction, which is the purview of Harvard University\'s Faculty of Arts and Sciences . The body known as The President and Fellows of Harvard College retains its traditional name despite having governance of the entire University. \n Historically open only to men, Harvard College and Harvard University are now both fully coeducational . \n [ edit ] Academics \n About 2100 students are admitted each year, representing between six and 10 percent of those applying; of those admitted approximately three-quarters choose to attend. [ 6 ]  [ 7 ]  [ 8 ]  [ 9 ] These figures make Harvard one of the most selective, and most sought-after, colleges in the world. [ citation needed ] Very few transfer applications are accepted. [ citation needed ] \n Most Harvard College graduates receive the Artium Baccalaureus (A.B.), normally completed in four years, though students completing substantial college-level coursework in high school can graduate in three. A smaller number receive the Scientiarum Baccalaureus (S.B.), normally requiring five years, and there are also special degree programs, such as a five-year program leading to both a Harvard undergraduate degree and a Master of Arts from the New England Conservatory of Music . \n Midway through the second year, most undergraduates join one of fifty standard fields of concentration (what most schools call an academic major ); many also declare a secondary field (called minors elsewhere). Joint concentrations (combining the requirements of two standard concentrations) and special concentrations (of the student\'s own design) are also possible. [ citation needed ] \n Undergraduates must also fulfill the General Education requirement of coursework in eight designated fields: \n \n \n \n \n Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding \n Culture and Belief \n Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning \n \n \n \n \n Ethical Reasoning \n Science of Living Systems \n Science of the Physical Universe \n \n \n \n \n Societies of the World \n United States in the World \n \n \n \n \n Each student\'s exposure (via "Gen Ed") to a range of intellectual areas, while pursuing a chosen concentration in depth, fulfills the injunction of Harvard past-president Abbott Lawrence Lowell that each graduate should "know a little of everything, and one thing well." [ 10 ] \n \n [ edit ] House system \n \n \n \n  \nLowell House in autumn. \n \n \n Nearly all undergraduates live on campus, for the first year in dormitories in or near Harvard Yard ( see List of Harvard dormitories ) and later in the upperclass Houses \xe2\x80\x94administrative subdivisions of the College as well as living quarters, providing a sense of community in what might otherwise be a socially incohesive and administratively daunting university environment. Each house is presided over by a senior-faculty Master, while its Allston Burr Resident Dean (usually a junior faculty member) supervises undergraduates\' day-to-day academic and disciplinary well-being. The Master and Resident Dean are assisted by other members of the Senior Common Room \xe2\x80\x94select graduate students (called tutors ), faculty, and University officials brought into voluntary association with each house. Many tutors are resident within the House, as are the Master and Resident Dean. (Terms such as tutor, Senior Common Room and Junior Common Room \xe2\x80\x94the House\'s undergraduate members\xe2\x80\x94reflect a debt to the residential college systems at Oxford and Cambridge from which Harvard\'s system took inspiration.) [ 11 ] \n The Houses were created by President Lowell in the 1930s to combat what he saw as pernicious social stratification engendered by the private, off-campus living arrangements of many undergraduates at that time. Lowell\'s solution was to provide on-campus accommodations to every student throughout his entire career at the College; Lowell also saw great benefits flowing from other features of the House system, such as the relaxed discussions (academic or otherwise) which he hoped would take place among undergraduates and members of the Senior Common Room over meals in each House\'s dining hall. [ 12 ] \n The way in which students come to live in particular Houses has changed greatly over time. Under the original "draft" system, Masters negotiated privately over the assignment of "rising sophomores" (that is, current freshmen, who will be sophomores in the coming academic year) considered most\xe2\x80\x94or least\xe2\x80\x94promising. [ citation needed ] From the 1960s to the mid-1990s each student ranked the Houses according to personal preference, with an impersonal lottery resolving the oversubscription of more popular houses. Today groups of one to eight freshman form a block which is then assigned, essentially at random, to an upperclass house. \n South of Harvard Yard, near the Charles River , are the nine River Houses: \n \n \n \n \n Adams House \n Dunster House \n \n \n \n \n Eliot House \n Kirkland House \n \n \n \n \n Leverett House \n Lowell House \n \n \n \n \n Mather House \n Quincy House \n \n \n \n \n John Winthrop House \n \n \n \n \n The construction of the River houses was financed largely by a 1928 gift from Yale alumnus Edward Harkness who, frustrated in his attempts to initiate a similar project at his alma mater, eventually offered 11 million dollars to Harvard. [ 13 ]  [ 14 ] Two of the new houses, Dunster and Lowell, were completed in 1930. [ 13 ] \n Construction of the first River houses began in early 1929, [ 13 ] but the land on which they were built had been assembled decades before. After graduating Harvard in 1895, Edward Waldo Forbes (grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson ) found himself inspired by the Oxford and Cambridge systems during two years of study in England; on returning to the United States he set out to acquire such land between Harvard Yard and the Charles River as was not already owned by Harvard or some associated entity. By 1918 that ambition had been largely fulfilled and the assembled land transferred to Harvard. [ 15 ]  [ 16 ] \n The three Quad Houses (in the Harvard\xe2\x80\x94formerly Radcliffe \xe2\x80\x94Quadrangle ) enjoy a residential setting one-half mile (800 m) northwest of Harvard Yard. These housed Radcliffe College students until the Harvard and Radcliffe residential systems merged in 1977. [ 17 ] They are: \n \n \n \n \n Cabot House \n \n \n \n \n Currier House \n \n \n \n \n Pforzheimer House \n \n \n \n \n A thirteenth house, Dudley House , is nonresidential but fulfills, for some graduate students and the (very few) undergraduates living off campus, the administrative and social functions provided by the other twelve houses to their residents. \n Harvard\'s residential houses are paired with Yale\'s residential colleges in sister relationships . \n [ edit ] Athletics \n Main article: Harvard Crimson \n By the late 19th century critics of intercollegiate athletics, including Harvard president Charles William Eliot , believed that sports competition had become over-commercialized and took students away from their studies, and they called for reform and limitations on all sports. This opposition prompted Harvard\'s athletic committee to target \'minor\' sports\xe2\x80\x94basketball and hockey\xe2\x80\x94for reform and regulation in order to deflect attention from the major sports\xe2\x80\x94football, baseball, track, and crew. The committee made it difficult for the basketball team to operate by denying financial assistance and limiting the number of overnight away games in which the team could participate. Several losing seasons, negative attitudes toward the commercialization of intercollegiate sports, and the need for reform contributed to basketball\'s demise at Harvard in 1909. [ 18 ] \n Today Harvard, one of the eight members of the Ivy League , claims [ clarification needed ] to have the largest Division I intercollegiate athletics program, with 41 varsity teams and over 1,500 student-athletes. \n Begun in 1852 the Harvard-Yale Regatta is the oldest intercollegiate athletic rivalry in the United States Better known is the annual Harvard-Yale football game \xe2\x80\x94"The Game", to insiders\xe2\x80\x94first played in New Haven , Connecticut, in 1875, and now played on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, making it one of many significant games played on "Rivalry Day."

Admission is based on achievement and promise; applying for financial aid does not diminish a student\x92s chances of admission. Indeed, the Admissions Committee may respond favorably to evidence that a candidate has overcome significant obstacles, financial or otherwise. \n\n Our recent sweeping changes in financial aid ensure the affordability of a Harvard education for students and families across the economic spectrum. It now costs the same or less for 90 percent of families in the U.S. to send their daughters or sons to Harvard than to their flagship public university. \n\n All students\x97American and international\x97benefit equally from Harvard\x92s admission and financial aid policies. Perhaps due in part to generous financial aid, Harvard\x92s graduation rate of 96 to 98 percent is at or near the top of the nation\x92s colleges.\n \n\n There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Students with vastly different credentials come from thousands of secondary schools across the country and around the world. What unifies our students are the talents they bring to Harvard and the passion to explore its vast resources. \n\n What We Seek \n\n Applicants can distinguish themselves for admission in a number of ways. Some show unusual academic promise through experience or achievements in study or research. Many are "well rounded" and have contributed in various ways to the lives of their schools or communities. Others are "well lopsided" with demonstrated excellence in a particular endeavor\x97academic, extracurricular or otherwise. Still others bring perspectives formed by unusual personal circumstances or experiences. \n\n Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but we also seek people with enthusiasm, creativity and strength of character. \n\n Most admitted students rank in the top 10\x9615 percent of their graduating classes, having taken the most rigorous secondary school curriculum available to them.\n \n\t \n\t \n \n\n Harvard University \n\n| Harvard College \n\n| Financial Aid \n\n| Contact: 617.495.1551 \n\n| &copy; 2009 President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College \n \n Find Harvard on:'

The program aims \xe2\x80\x9cto honor the American Immigrant Tradition\xe2\x80\x94to remind people of the contributions immigrants have historically made\xe2\x80\x94and to honor individuals who are clearly well-positioned to continue in that tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d Soros program director Stanley J. Heginbotham said. The fellowship program seeks to identify students who show creativity, initiative, and innovation. \xe2\x80\x9cOur view is that past is prologue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Heginbotham. \xe2\x80\x9cWe look for students whose prior accomplishments demonstrate these qualities\xe2\x80\x94students who have that spark, if you will.\xe2\x80\x9d Students\xe2\x80\x99 personal histories, families, opportunities, and challenges also factor into the selection process. \n    \n     \n    \n     This year\xe2\x80\x99s fellows were selected from a pool of over 1,050 applicants. Each Fellow will receive up to $90,000 in tuition and stipend assistance for graduate education in the United States. Recipient Amrapali Maitra \xe2\x80\x9910 will use the fellowship to continue working towards an M.D. and a Ph.D. in anthropology at Stanford University. Maitra said she hopes to \xe2\x80\x9cmobilize her education and privilege\xe2\x80\x9d to help South Asian women facing violence in their homes and communities. Fellow Vivek Viswanathan \xe2\x80\x9909, who will use the award to continue pursuing joint J.D. and M.B.A. degrees at Stanford University, said he aspires to make a difference in politics and to one day run for public office. Viswanathan expressed gratitude for the support he received from Harvard professors and staff after graduating, citing recommendations from government professor Roger B. Porter, who supervised his thesis, and Kris Locke, a former program manager at the Harvard Bridge Center for his fellowship application. Both Maitra and Viswanathan said they appreciate the way in which the program unites fellows. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the primary reasons I applied for the fellowship was to meet a community of scholars similarly shaped by immigrant experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maitra.

The Game is played in November at the end of the football season, with the venue alternating between Harvard Stadium and the Yale Bowl .

Harvard won 4\xe2\x80\x930 by scoring four touchdowns and four field goals (at the time, a touchdown merely gave the scoring team the opportunity to gain one point by converting the field goal). At the time, the sport of American football was still evolving from rugby . \n The rules that governed the early years of The Game were a modified version of the rules of rugby and made the game particularly brutal. In the second half of The Game of 1892, Harvard introduced the flying wedge formation, devised by chess master Lorin F. Deland, which so devastated Yale players that it was outlawed the following season (nevertheless, Yale won 6\xe2\x80\x930). Between 1890 and 1894, The Game was played on neutral territory in Hampden Park, Springfield, MA (roughly halfway between Cambridge and New Haven). After The Game of 1894, which came to be known as the "Hampden Park Bloodbath" and about which newspapers reported seven players carried off the field "in dying condition," the two schools broke off all official contact including athletic competition for two years. Since resuming in 1897 at Harvard, The Game has been played annually, except during World War I and World War II , alternating between Cambridge and New Haven. \n The first known reference to "The Game" occurs in an 1898 letter by former Harvard captain A. Holden (class of 1888) to Harvard coach Cam Forbes on the occasion of The Game being permanently moved to the end of the season (" it also makes the Yale\xe2\x80\x93Harvard game the last game of the season "). But public capitalized reference to The Game appears to have been first made by syndicated sports columnist Red Smith . In 1959, he called a Yale athletics official at the time, Charlie Loftus, to say he wouldn\'t be able to make that year\'s Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football match. Loftus disbelievingly replied, "What? You\'re going to miss \'The Game.\'" Although Smith\'s absence went largely unnoticed at the game that year, his column did not. In that week\'s paper, Smith "borrowed" the sobriquet from Loftus\' comment and christened the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry football match "The Game" for good. The name clinched its legendary foothold when, the following year, Harvard Sports Information Director Baron Pittenger mantled the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale game program with the respective title, and that made the name stick. [ 1 ] \n Since Tim Murphy\'s arrival as Head Coach of Harvard for the 1994 season, Harvard has dominated the series, going 14\xe2\x80\x935, including 11 of the last 12 through 2012. This makes Murphy the winningest coach in the long series. Yale\'s sole win during the past decade was in 2006. Murphy can also boast of two undefeated and untied teams during this streak, while Yale\'s last unbeaten/untied season was in 1931. Harvard\'s current six-game streak is tied (with Yale\'s 1902\xe2\x80\x9307 six-game streak) for the second longest winning streak of the series behind Yale\'s 1880\xe2\x80\x931889 eight-game streak. \n Harvard has been the better "spoiler" between the two teams. Over the past century, of the ten times Yale entered The Game undefeated, it exited the game victorious only once, while Harvard "upset" the Bulldogs on seven occasions: 1912, 1921, 1937, 1968 (with the infamous 29\xe2\x80\x9329 "tie"), 1974, 1979 and 2007. Over the same period of time, Harvard has arrived at The Game undefeated nine times, triumphing all but once (1931). \n The Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale football rivalry is the second oldest continuing rivalry and also the third most-played rivalry game in college football history, after the Lehigh \xe2\x80\x93 Lafayette Rivalry (1884) and the Princeton \xe2\x80\x93Yale game (1873). As of 2012, the Harvard Crimson and Yale Bulldogs have met 129 times since the first game in 1875. \n [ edit ] Significance \n For many students and alumni of Harvard and Yale, The Game is an important event. The schools are located only a few hours\' travel from one another; and, perhaps because they are among the nation\'s most prestigious and oldest universities, the rivalry is intense. Beating the rival is often considered more important than the team\'s season record. Since 1900, the Game has been the final game of the season for both teams, since Ivy League schools do not participate in post-season football games (the one exception occurring in 1919, when Harvard beat Yale 3\xe2\x80\x930 and then went on to the 1920 Rose Bowl Game , in which they defeated Oregon 7\xe2\x80\x936). \n \n \n \n  \nHalf-time festivities at The Game, Yale Bowl . \n \n \n The Game is significant for historical reasons in that the first game of the rivalry (in November 1875) was the second American football game played between U.S. colleges featuring a ball-carrying form of the game (the first being a Harvard-Tufts football match that occurred in June 1875). The rules of that game soon were adopted by other schools, such as Rutgers and Princeton, which had been playing soccer (i.e., Association Football ) since 1869, and American football quickly became the archetypal college sport. The schools that would become the Ivy League played the leading role in the development of American football in the late 19th century; football\'s rules, conventions, and equipment, as well as elements of "atmosphere" such as the mascot and fight song , include many elements pioneered or nurtured at Harvard and Yale. For many years, The Game was also likely to determine the Ivy League championship. The Game receives less national attention today; most college football fans are more interested in games between larger institutions whose teams are made up of scholarship athletes, many of them bound for professional careers. The high attendance at Harvard Stadium or the Yale Bowl for the contest testify that The Game still generates interest beyond the respective campuses and alumni bodies; tickets for The Game generally sell out even in modern times when The Game is played at Harvard, as Harvard Stadium\'s seating capacity is less than half that of the Yale Bowl. \n In 2003, Sports Illustrated magazine ("On Campus" edition) rated the Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale rivalry as the sixth-best in college athletics. \n [ edit ] Notable games \n [ edit ] First tie: 1879 \n The game played on November 8, 1879 ended in a scoreless tie , the first of eight ties in the series. \n [ edit ] Harvard Beats Yale, 29\xe2\x80\x9329 \n \n See 1968 Yale vs. Harvard football game \n \n In 1968, the Harvard team made a miraculous last-moment comeback by scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie a highly touted Yale squad. Yale had a 16-game winning streak and both teams were undefeated for the season at 8\xe2\x80\x930 coming into the game. \n The tie left both teams 8\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 for the season, inspiring The Harvard Crimson to print the headline " Harvard Beats Yale, 29-29 ". [ 2 ] This headline was later used as the title for a 2008 documentary about this Game directed by Kevin Rafferty . [ 3 ] \n This game stands as the final tie in the series, as subsequent rule changes have eliminated ties from college football. [ 4 ] \n [ edit ] First overtime game: 2005 \n On November 19, 2005, Harvard defeated Yale in the rivalry\'s first overtime matchup. Harvard won by a score of 30\xe2\x80\x9324 after three overtime periods. \n [ edit ] Pranks \n The Game is an inviting target for pranksters. For example, in 1961 in New Haven, The Harvard Crimson student newspaper distributed a parody of The Yale Daily News with a headline saying that President Kennedy would attend. At the Bowl, the President of the Crimson ( Robert Ellis Smith ) donned a mask of President Kennedy, had friends dressed as a Secret Service man and a military aide, and walked on the field before the game as the Harvard Band played " Hail to the Chief ". Thousands of early arrivals and sports writers were fooled by the prank. President Kennedy, a Harvard graduate, was listening to the game on the radio in Hyannisport, according to later news reports. \n Prior to The Game in 1933, Handsome Dan II, Yale\'s bulldog mascot, was kidnapped (allegedly by members of the Harvard Lampoon ). Then, the morning after a 19\xe2\x80\x936 upset by Harvard over Yale, after hamburger was smeared on the feet of the statue of John Harvard that sits in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard \xe2\x80\x93 a photo was snapped of Handsome Dan licking John Harvard\'s feet. The photo ran on the front page of papers throughout the country. [ 5 ] \n In 1962, Harvard Band members marched through New Haven, playing their instruments at 3 a.m. much to the chagrin of the New Haven police. \n MIT "Hacks" [ 6 ] \nPerhaps the most famous exploit was carried out at Harvard Stadium during the second quarter in 1982, when a Harvard score was immediately followed by a huge black weather balloon , previously installed under the 45 yard line by students from MIT as the letters painted on its side proclaimed, slowly inflating until it exploded, spraying talcum powder over the field (Harvard won, 45\xe2\x80\x937). \n For the 2006 Game, MIT students secretly replaced the "VE-RI-TAS" insignia on the Harvard Stadium Scoreboard with an insignia that read "HU-GE-EGO". \n On November 18, 1990, during the third quarter of The Game, MIT students carried out a less surreptitious assault. As a kicker prepared for a field goal, a rocket shot from the field over the goal posts, hanging an MIT banner. The rocket was launched using 480 feet of wire that ran underneath the field. A headline the next day in the Boston Herald read, "MIT 1 \xe2\x80\x94 Harvard\xe2\x80\x93Yale 0; Tech Pranksters Steal the Show" (although Yale won the actual football game, 34\xe2\x80\x9319). \n In 2006, two streakers with MIT painted on their bodies attempted to run around the field during the game. One made it the length of the field before being caught and dragged off the field; the other was tackled by security about ten steps out of the stands. \n \nDuring the pregame show in 1992, the Harvard marching band attempted to "X-out" [ clarification needed ] the Yale Precision Marching Band while the Yale band stood in its traditional Y formation; however, the Yale band caught wind of this plan and, as the Harvard band marched onto the field, shifted its formation into a large H, thus making Harvard X itself out. [ citation needed ] \n In 2004, Yale students handed out placards to some 1,800 adult Harvard fans; when raised, the signs spelled out " WE SUCK ". Harvard won that game 35\xe2\x80\x933. \n In 2012, the Game was hosted at Harvard University. During tailgate the Yale prank group the Pundits had an anti-Harvard banner skywritten via plane. \n [ edit ] Tailgate \n The Game has also become known for the large, joint Harvard-Yale tailgate parties that run throughout The Game in the fields next to the host stadium every year. The tailgate party was even televised by ESPN in 2004. While most alumni who travel to The Game actually watch it in the stadium, most students and recent alumni treat the tailgate as their primary destination. The tailgate attracts thousands of students and has recently roused the concern of the Boston Police Department , who have cracked down on underage drinking at the student tailgates, as well as moving it further away from the stadium and reducing the space available. [ 7 ] This included requiring, in 2008, that all tailgates end at halftime, leading Yale students to shift most of their tailgating to the Princeton game, held the previous week in New Haven. \n In 2011, a tailgater was killed from a U-Haul truck collision. [ 8 ] \n [ edit ] Bulldog legend \n Apocryphal tales assert that before the 1908 Game, Harvard coach Percy Haughton strangled a bulldog to death in the locker room to motivate his players. Research has indicated that there were no contemporary reports of this incident \xe2\x80\x93 and later accounts suggest that Haughton had created a Bulldog doll and had strangled that. In addition, these reports indicate that he had attached the doll to his car and drove around town dragging the doll. Whatever the facts are, Harvard did win the 1908 game, 4\xe2\x80\x930, the culmination of a 9\xe2\x80\x930\xe2\x80\x931 national championship season.

The most notorious line in the article &#8211; which did not come from the original report &#8211; was that a 40-year-old unmarried woman with a B.A. was "more likely to be killed by a terrorist" than ever to marry. This report was unlikely at the time, but the "Harvard-Yale Study" became notorious, attacked by marriage-ambivalent feminists and striking fear into the hearts of unmarried educated women everywhere. This story was particularly important to the Gruntleds because we were graduate students at Yale when that report was written, and one of the co-authors, Trisha Craig, was a college as well as a graduate school classmate of ours. This week the magazine is running a follow-up story to show how silly the fears they fomented before were. Most of the single and worried women they interviewed in the story subsequently got married and stayed that way. The old rules, Newsweek intones, don\'t apply any more. Educated men want to marry educated women, and artificial reproductive technology means that women can have babies indefinitely. The new story is a silly as the old one was. Yes, educated women are marrying later, and their marriages are more likely to last than those of less educated women. Yes, there are all kinds of expensive miracle treatments that extend fertility for a few years for some women. But biology has not been repealed, nor sociobiology. And Newsweek did not report that, ironically, Craig herself is unmarried (though she does not report that as a tragedy). The main point, though, is that the "Harvard-Yale" demographers did not set out to study the marital chances of educated women, but of uneducated welfare mothers. Those were, and still are, slim. For comparison, they included numbers on the marital chances of educated women of different ages. But Newsweek isn\'t aimed at welfare mothers, and neither are the thousand and one women\'s magazines that picked up the story. For their readers, the footnote was the story. And Newsweek , like most news organizations, usually finds a way to turn every story into something readers can fear. The good news is that educated women do have a good chance of marrying. The bad news is that uneducated welfare mothers don\'t. And that is something that we as a society should be concerned about.\n \n \n \n \n \nPosted by\n \n \n \n Gruntled \n \n \n \n \nat\n \n 9:31 AM \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2 comments: \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n KLG \nsaid...\n \n \n \nI guess I\'ll have to go back and read that study, because apparently I live in a part of the country that is an outlier or is very different from the study sample. (I\'m in Central Texas) I and many of my female friends are highly educated with advanced degrees. All of us married soon after completing our undergraduate degrees, to similarly well educated men. I am the only one still married after 19 years, and some of them are already on their second divorce. I am also the only one with children. Any connection? Others of my female friends with long-lasting happy marriages are less well educated - they either have no degree or stopped after their undergrad or associates degree. I wonder if the women who continued on beyond that point have less realsitic expectations of their mate, or put more emphasis on their careers than on their marriage because of the same ambition that drove them to complete advanced degrees?\n \n \n \n \n \n6:12 PM, May 29, 2006\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n Gruntled \nsaid...\n \n \n \nIt is hard to say without knowing much more about the cases, but on these facts I would say that to ambitious career workers with no kids to hold them together would find ample temptations to divorce over the years.\n \n \n \n \n \n7:13 AM, May 30, 2006\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Post a Comment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n   \n  \n \n \n \n Newer Post \n \n \n Older Post \n \n Home \n \n \n \n \nSubscribe to:\n Post Comments (Atom) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n Presbyterian Bloggers \n \n Presbyterian Bloggers Powered By Ringsurf'
